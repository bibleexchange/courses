<p><h3>Book 10</h3>
<br><h3>Jonah</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse10_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Ra.
<br> These are the verses of the wise Book.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.2</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> is it a wonder to the people that We revealed to a  man from among themselves,
<br> saying:
<br> Warn the people and give  good news to those who believe that theirs is a footing of  firmness with their Lord.
<br> The unbelievers say:
<br> This is most  surely a manifest enchanter.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely your Lord is Allah,
<br> Who created the heavens and  the earth in six periods,
<br> and He is firm in power,
<br> regulating the  affair,
<br> there is no intercessor except aher His permission;
<br> this is  Allah,
<br> your Lord,
<br> therefore serve Him;
<br> will you not then mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.4</b>]
<br>
<br> To Him is your return,
<br> of all (of you);
<br> the promise of Allah  (made) in truth;
<br> surely He begins the creation in the first mstance,
<br>  then He reproduces it,
<br> that He may with justice recompense  those who believe and do good;
<br> and (as for) those who  disbelieve,
<br> they shall have a drink of hot water and painful  punishment because they disbelieved.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.5</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who made the sun a shining brightness and the  moon a light,
<br> and ordained for it mansions that you might know  the computation of years and the reckoning.
<br> Allah did not create  it but with truth;
 He makes the signs manifest for a people who<br>
<a name = "verse10_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely in the variation of the night and the day,
<br> and  what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth,
<br> there are  signs for a people who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse10_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who do not hope in Our meeting and are  pleased with this world's life and are content with it,
<br> and those  who are heedless of Our communications:
<br>
<a name = "verse10_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.8</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those,
<br> their abode is the fire because of what they  earned.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who believe and do good,
<br> their Lord  will guide them by their faith;
<br> there shall flOw from beneath  them rivers in gardens of bliss.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Their cry in it shall be:
<br> Glory to Thee,
<br> O Allah!
<br> and their  greeting in it shall be:
<br> Peace;
<br> and the last of their cry shall be:
<br>  Praise be to Allah,
<br> the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And if Allah should hasten the evil to men as they desire  the hastening on of good,
<br> their doom should certainly have been  decreed for them;
<br> but We leave those alone who hope not for  Our meeting in their inordinacy,
<br> blindly wandering on.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And when affliction touches a man,
<br> he calls on Us,
<br> whether  lying on his side or sitting or standing;
<br> but when We remove his  affliction from him,
<br> he passes on as though he had never called  on Us on account of an affliction that touched him;
<br> thus that  which they do is made fair-seeming to the extravagant.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We did destroy generations before you  when they were unjust,
<br> and their apostles had come to them with  clear arguments,
<br> and they would not believe;
<br> thus do We recompense  the guilty people.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We made you successors in the land after them so  that We may see how you act.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our clear communications are recited to them,
<br>  those who hope not for Our meeting say:
<br> Bring a Quran other  than this or change it.
<br> Say:
<br> It does not beseem me that I should  change it of myself;
<br> I follow naught but what is revealed to me;
<br>  surely I fear,
<br> if I disobey my Lord,
<br> the punishment of a mighty  day.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If Allah had desired (otherwise) I would not have  recited it to you,
<br> nor would He have taught it to you;
<br> indeed I  have lived a lifetime among you before it;
<br> do you not then  understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Who is then more unjust than who forges a lie against  Allah or (who) gives the lie to His communications?
<br> Surely the  guilty shall not be successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And they serve beside Allah what can neither harm them  nor profit them,
<br> and they say:
<br> These are our intercessors with  Allah.
<br> Say:
<br> Do you (presume to) inform Allah of what He  knows not in the heavens and the earth?
<br> Glory be to Him,
<br> and  supremely exalted is He above what they set up (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse10_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And people are naught but a single nation,
<br> so they disagree;
<br>  and had not a word already gone forth from your Lord,
<br>  the matter would have certainly been decided between them in  respect of that concerning which they disagree.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Why is not a sign sent to him from his  Lord?
<br> Say:
<br> The unseen is only for Allah;
<br> therefore wait-- surely I  too,
<br> with you am of those who wait.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We make people taste of mercy after an affliction  touches them,
<br> lo !
<br> they devise plans against Our communication.
<br>  Say:
<br> Allah is quicker to plan;
<br> surely Our messengers write  down what you plan.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.22</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who makes you travel by land and sea;
<br> until when  you are in the ships,
<br> and they sail on with them in a pleasant  breeze,
<br> and they rejoice,
<br> a violent wind overtakes them and the  billows surge in on them from all sides,
<br> and they become certain  that they are encompassed about,
<br> they pray to Allah,
<br> being  sincere to Him in obedience:
<br> If Thou dost deliver us from this,
<br>  we will most certainly be of the grateful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.23</b>]
<br>
<br> But when He delivers them,
<br> lo!
<br> they are unjustly rebellious  in the earth.
<br> O men!
<br> your rebellion is against your own  souls-- provision (only) of this world's life-- then to Us shall be  your return,
<br> so We will inform you of what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.24</b>]
<br>
<br> The likeness of this world's life is only as water which We  send down from the cloud,
<br> then the herbage of the earth of  which men and cattle eat grows luxuriantly thereby,
<br> until when  the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes garnished,
<br>  and its people think that they have power over it,
<br> Our command  comes to it,
<br> by night or by day,
<br> so We render it as reaped seed;
<br>  produce,
<br> as though it had not been in existence yesterday;
<br> thus  do We make clear the communications for a people who reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah invites to the abode of peace and guides whom  He pleases into the right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.26</b>]
<br>
<br> For those who do good is good (reward) and more (than  this);
<br> and blackness or ignominy shall not cover their faces;
<br> these  are the dwellers of the garden;
<br> in it they shall abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who have earned evil,
<br> the punishment  of an evil is the like of it,
<br> and abasement shall come upon them--  they shall have none to protect them from Allah-- as if their  faces had been covered with slices of the dense darkness of night;
<br>  these are the inmates of the fire;
<br> in it they shall abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when We will gather them all together,
<br>  then We will say to those who associated others (with Allah):
<br>  Keep where you are,
<br> you and your associates;
<br> then We shall  separate them widely one from another and their associates  would say:
<br> It was not us that you served:
<br>
<a name = "verse10_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore Allah is sufficient as a witness between us and  you that we were quite unaware of your serving (us).
<br>
<a name = "verse10_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.30</b>]
<br>
<br> There shall every soul become acquainted with what it  sent before,
<br> and they shall be brought back to Allah,
<br> their true  Patron,
<br> and what they devised shall escape from them.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the  earth?
<br> Or Who controls the hearing and the sight?
<br> And Who  brings forth the living from the dead,
<br> and brings forth the dead  from the living?
<br> And Who regulates the affairs?
<br> Then they will  say:
<br> Allah.
<br> Say then:
<br> Will you not then guard (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.32</b>]
<br>
<br> This then is Allah,
<br> your true Lord;
<br> and what is there after  the truth but error;
<br> how are you then turned back?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus does the word of your Lord prove true against those  who transgress that they do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Is there any one among your associates who can  bring into existence the creation in the first instance,
<br> then reproduce  it?
<br> Say:
<br> Allah brings the creation into existence,
<br> then He  reproduces it;
<br> how are you then turned away?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Is there any of your associates who guides to the  truth?
<br> Say:
<br> Allah guides to the truth.
<br> Is He then Who guides to  the truth more worthy to be followed,
<br> or he who himself does  not go aright unless he is guided?
<br> What then is the matter with  you;
<br> how do you judge?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And most of them do not follow (anything) but conjecture;
<br>  surely conjecture will not avail aught against the truth;
<br>  surely Allah is cognizant of what they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And this Quran is not such as could be forged by those  besides Allah,
<br> but it is a verification of that which is before it and  a clear explanation of the book,
<br> there is no doubt in it,
<br> from the  Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they say:
<br> He has forged it?
<br> Say:
<br> Then bring a  chapter like this and invite whom you can besides Allah,
<br> if you  are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> they reject that of which they have no comprehensive  knowledge,
<br> and the final sequel of it has not yet come to them;
<br>  even thus did those before them reject (the truth);
<br> see then what  was the end of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And of them is he who believes in it,
<br> and of them is he  who does not believe in it,
<br> and your Lord best knows the  mischief-makers.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they call you a liar,
<br> say:
<br> My work is for me and  your work for you;
<br> you are clear of what I do and I am clear of  what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And there are those of them who hear you,
<br> but can you  make the deaf to hear though they will not understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And there are those of them who look at you,
<br> but can you  show the way to the blind though they will not see?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah does not do any injustice to men,
<br> but men  are unjust to themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when He will gather them as though they  had not stayed but an hour of the day,
<br> they will know each  other.
<br> They will perish indeed who called the meeting with Allah  to be a lie,
<br> and they are not followers of the right direction.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We show you something of what We threaten them  with,
<br> or cause you to die,
<br> yet to Us is their return,
<br> and Allah is  the bearer of witness to what they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And every nation had an apostle;
<br> so when their apostle  came,
<br> the matter was decided between them with justice and they  shall not be dealt with unjustly.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> When will this threat come about,
<br> if you are  truthful?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I do not control for myself any harm,
<br> or any benefit  except what Allah pleases;
<br> every nation has a term;
<br> when their  term comes,
<br> they shall not then remain behind for an hour,
<br> nor  can they go before (their time).
<br>
<a name = "verse10_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Tell me if His punishment overtakes you by night or  by day!
<br> what then is there of it that the guilty would hasten on?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it comes to pass,
<br> will you believe in it?
<br> What!
<br>  now (you believe),
<br> and already you wished to have it hastened on.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Then it shall be said to those who were unjust:
<br> Taste  abiding chastisement;
<br> you are not requited except for what you  earned.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And they ask you:
<br> Is that true?
<br> Say:
<br> Aye!
<br> by my Lord!
<br> it is  most surely the truth,
<br> and you will not escape.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And if every soul that has done injustice had all that is in  the earth,
<br> it would offer it for ransom,
<br> and they will manifest  regret when they see the chastisement and the matter shall be  decided between them with justice and they shall not be dealt  with unjustly.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Now surely Allah's is what is in the heavens and the earth;
<br>  now surely Allah's promise is true,
<br> but most of them do not  know.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.56</b>]
<br>
<br> He gives life and causes death,
<br> and to Him you shall be  brought back.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.57</b>]
<br>
<br> O men!
<br> there has come to you indeed an admonition from  your Lord and a healing for what is in the breasts and a guidance  and a mercy for the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.58</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> In the grace of Allah and in His mercy-- in that they  should rejoice;
<br> it is better than that which they gather.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Tell me what Allah has sent down for you of sustenance,
<br>  then you make (a part) of it unlawful and (a part)  lawful.
<br> Say:
<br> Has Allah commanded you,
<br> or do you forge a lie  against Allah?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And what will be the thought of those who forge lies  against Allah on the day of resurrection?
<br> Most surely Allah is  the Lord of grace towards men,
<br> but most of them do not give  thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And you are not (engaged) in any affair,
<br> nor do you recite  concerning it any portion of the Quran,
<br> nor do you do any work  but We are witnesses over you when you enter into it,
<br> and there  does not lie concealed from your Lord the weight of an atom in  the earth or in the heaven,
<br> nor any thing less than that nor  greater,
<br> but it is in a clear book.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.62</b>]
<br>
<br> Now surely the friends of Allah-- they shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who believe and guarded (against evil):
<br>
<a name = "verse10_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.64</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall have good news in this world's life and in the  hereafter;
<br> there is no changing the words of Allah;
<br> that is the  mighty achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And let not their speech grieve you;
<br> surely might is wholly  Allah's;
<br> He is the Hearing,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Now,
<br> surely,
<br> whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in  the earth is Allah's;
<br> and they do not (really) follow any associates,
<br>  who call on others besides Allah;
<br> they do not follow  (anything) but conjectures,
<br> and they only lie.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.67</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who made for you the night that you might rest in  it,
<br> and the day giving light;
<br> most surely there are signs in it for a  people who would hear.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.68</b>]
<br>
<br> They say:
<br> Allah has taken a son (to Himself)!
<br> Glory be to  Him:
<br> He is the Self-sufficient:
<br> His is what is in the heavens and  what is in the earth;
<br> you have no authority for this;
<br> do you say  against Allah what you do not know?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Those who forge a lie against Allah shall not be  successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.70</b>]
<br>
<br> (It is only) a provision in this world,
<br> then to Us shall be  their return;
<br> then We shall make them taste severe punishment  because they disbelieved.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And recite to them the story of Nuh when he said to his  people:
<br> O my people!
<br> if my stay and my reminding (you) by the  communications of Allah is hard on you-- yet on Allah do I  rely-- then resolve upon your affair and (gather) your associates,
<br>  then let not your affair remain dubious to you,
<br> then have it  executed against me and give me no respite:
<br>

[<b>10.72</b>]
<br>
<br> But if you turn back,
<br> I did not ask for any reward from  you;
<br> my reward is only with Allah,
<br> and I am commanded that I  should be of those who submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.73</b>]
<br>
<br> But they rejected him,
<br> so We delivered him and those with  him in the ark,
<br> and We made them rulers and drowned those  who rejected Our communications;
<br> see then what was the end of  the (people) warned.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.74</b>]
<br>
<br> Then did We raise up after him apostles to their people,
<br> so  they came to them with clear arguments,
<br> but they would not  believe in what they had rejected before;
<br> thus it is that We set  seals upon the hearts of those who exceed the limits.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.75</b>]
<br>
<br> Then did We send up after them Musa and Haroun to  Firon and his chiefs with Our signs,
<br> but they showed pride and  they were a guilty people.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.76</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the truth came to them from Us they said:
<br> This is  most surely clear enchantment!
<br>
<a name = "verse10_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.77</b>]
<br>
<br> Musa said:
<br> Do you say (this) of the truth when it has come  to you?
<br> Is it magic?
<br> And the magicians are not successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.78</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Have you come to us to turn us away from  what we found our fathers upon,
<br> and (that) greatness in the land  should be for you two?
<br> And we are not going to believe in you.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.79</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon said:
<br> Bring to me every skillful magician.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the magicians came,
<br> Musa said to them:
<br> Cast  down what you have to cast.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.81</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they cast down,
<br> Musa said to them:
<br> What you  have brought is deception;
<br> surely Allah will make it naught;
<br>  surely Allah does not make the work of mischief-makers to  thrive.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah will show the truth to be the truth by His  words,
<br> though the guilty may be averse (to it).
<br>
<a name = "verse10_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.83</b>]
<br>
<br> But none believed in Musa except the offspring of his  people,
<br> on account of the fear of Firon and their chiefs,
<br> lest he  should persecute them;
<br> and most surely Firon was lofty in the  land;
<br> and most surely he was of the extravagant.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.84</b>]
<br>
<br> And Musa said:
<br> O my people!
<br> if you believe in Allah,
<br> then  rely on Him (alone) if you submit (to Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse10_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.85</b>]
<br>
<br> So they said:
<br> On Allah we rely:
<br> O our Lord!
<br> make us not  subject to the persecution of the unjust people:
<br>
<a name = "verse10_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.86</b>]
<br>
<br> And do Thou deliver us by Thy mercy from the unbelieving  people.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.87</b>]
<br>
<br> And We revealed to Musa and his brother,
<br> saying:
<br> Take  for your people houses to abide in Egypt and make your houses  places of worship and keep up prayer and give good news to the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.88</b>]
<br>
<br> And Musa said:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> surely Thou hast given to  Firon and his chiefs finery and riches in this world's life,
<br> to this  end,
<br> our Lord,
<br> that they lead (people) astray from Thy way:
<br> Our  Lord!
<br> destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they  believe not until they see the painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.89</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> The prayer of you both has indeed been accepted,
<br>  therefore continue in the right way and do not follow the path of  those who do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.90</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made the children of Israel to pass through the  sea,
<br> then Firon and his hosts followed them for oppression and  tyranny;
<br> until when drowning overtook him,
<br> he said:
<br> I believe  that there is no god but He in Whom the children of Israel  believe and I am of those who submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.91</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> now!
<br> and indeed you disobeyed before and you  were of the mischief-makers.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.92</b>]
<br>
<br> But We will this day deliver you with your body that you  may be a sign to those after you,
<br> and most surely the majority of  the people are heedless to Our communications.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.93</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We lodged the children of Israel in a goodly  abode and We provided them with good things;
<br> but they did not  disagree until the knowledge had come to them;
<br> surely your  Lord will judge between them on the resurrection day concerning  that in which they disagreed.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.94</b>]
<br>
<br> But if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to  you,
<br> ask those who read the Book before you;
<br> certainly the truth  has come to you from your Lord,
<br> therefore you should not be of  the disputers.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.95</b>]
<br>
<br> And you should not be of those who reject the communications  of Allah,
<br> (for) then you should be one of the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.96</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those against whom the word of your Lord has  proved true will not believe,
<br>
<a name = "verse10_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.97</b>]
<br>
<br> Though every sign should come to them,
<br> until they witness  the painful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.98</b>]
<br>
<br> And wherefore was there not a town which should believe  so that their belief should have profited them but the people of  Yunus?
<br> When they believed,
<br> We removed from them the chastisement  of disgrace in this world's life and We gave them provision  till a time.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.99</b>]
<br>
<br> And if your Lord had pleased,
<br> surely all those who are in  the earth would have believed,
<br> all of them;
<br> will you then force  men till they become believers?
<br>
<a name = "verse10_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.100</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is not for a soul to believe except by Allah's  permission;
<br> and He casts uncleanness on those who will not  understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.101</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Consider what is it that is in the heavens and the  earth;
<br> and signs and warners do not avail a people who would  not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.102</b>]
<br>
<br> What do they wait for then but the like of the days of  those who passed away before them?
<br> Say:
<br> Wait then;
<br> surely I too  am with you of those who wait.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.103</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We deliver Our apostles and those who believe--  even so (now),
<br> it is binding on Us (that) We deliver the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.104</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O people!
<br> if you are in doubt as to my religion,
<br> then  (know that) I do not serve those whom you serve besides Allah  but I do serve Allah,
<br> Who will cause you to die,
<br> and I am  commanded that I should be of the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.105</b>]
<br>
<br> And that you should keep your course towards the religion  uprightly;
<br> and you should not be of the polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.106</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not call besides Allah on that which can neither  benefit you nor harm you,
<br> for if you do then surely you will in  that case be of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.107</b>]
<br>
<br> And if Allah should afflict you with harm,
<br> then there is  none to remove it but He;
<br> and if He intends good to you there is  none to repel His grace;
<br> He brings it to whom He pleases of His  servants;
<br> and He is the Forgiving,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.108</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O people!
<br> indeed there has come to you the truth  from your Lord,
<br> therefore whoever goes aright,
<br> he goes aright  only for the good of his own soul,
<br> and whoever goes astray,
<br> he  goes astray only to the detriment of it,
<br> and I am not a custodian  over you.
<br>
<a name = "verse10_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>10.109</b>]
<br>
<br> And follow what is revealed to you and be patient till  Allah should give judgment,
<br> and He is the best of the judges.
