<p><h3>Book 84</h3>
<br><h3>The Rending Asunder</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse84_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.1</b>]
<br>
<br> When the heaven bursts asunder,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And obeys its Lord and it must.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the earth is stretched,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And casts forth what is in it and becomes empty,
  <br>
<a name = "verse84_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  And obeys its Lord and it must.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.6</b>]
<br>
<br> O man!
<br> surely you must strive (to attain) to your Lord,
<br> a  hard striving until you meet Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Then as to him who is given his book in his right hand,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.8</b>]
<br>
<br> He shall be reckoned with by an easy reckoning,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And he shall go back to his people joyful.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And as to him who is given his book behind his back,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.11</b>]
<br>
<br> He shall call for perdition,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And enter into burning fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely he was (erstwhile) joyful among his followers.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely he thought that he would never return.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Yea!
<br> surely his Lord does ever see him.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.16</b>]
<br>
<br> But nay!
<br> I swear by the sunset redness,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And the night and that which it drives on,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And the moon when it grows full,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.19</b>]
<br>
<br> That you shall most certainly enter one state after  another.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.20</b>]
<br>
<br> But what is the matter with them that they do not  believe,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the Quran is recited to them they do not make  obeisance?
<br>
<a name = "verse84_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> those who disbelieve give the lie to the truth.
<br>
<a name = "verse84_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah knows best what they hide,
<br>
<a name = "verse84_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.24</b>]
<br>
 So announce to them a painful punishment<br>
<a name = "verse84_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>84.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Except those who believe and do good;
<br> for them is a  reward that shall never be cut off.
