<p><h3>Book 11</h3>
<br><h3>The Holy Prophet</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse11_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Ra (This is) a Book,
<br> whose verses are made  decisive,
<br> then are they made plain,
<br> from the Wise,
<br>  All-aware:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.2</b>]
<br>
<br> That you shall not serve (any) but Allah;
<br> surely I am a  warner for you from Him and a giver of good news,
<br>
<a name = "verse11_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And you that ask forgiveness of your Lord,
<br> then turn to  Him;
<br> He will provide you with a goodly provision to an  appointed term and bestow His grace on every one endowed  with grace,
<br> and if you turn back,
<br> then surely I fear for you  the chastisement of a great day.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.4</b>]
<br>
<br> To Allah is your return,
<br> and He has power over all  things.
  <br>
<a name = "verse11_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Now surely they fold up their breasts that they may  conceal (their enmity) from Him;
<br> now surely,
<br> when they use  their garments as a covering,
<br> He knows what they conceal and  what they make public;
<br> surely He knows what is in the  breasts.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And there is no animal in the earth but on Allah is the  sustenance of it,
<br> and He knows its resting place and its  depository all (things) are in a manifest book.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six  periods-- and His dominion (extends) on the water-- that He  might manifest to you,
<br> which of you is best in action,
<br> and  if you say,
<br> surely you shall be raised up after death,
<br> those  who disbelieve would certainly say:
<br> This is nothing but  clear magic.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We hold back from them the punishment until a  stated period of time,
<br> they will certainly say:
<br> What  prevents it?
<br> Now surely on the day when it will come to  them,
<br> it shall not be averted from them and that which they  scoffed at shall beset them.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We make man taste mercy from Us,
<br> then take it off  from him,
<br> most surely he is despairing,
<br> ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We make him taste a favor after distress has  afflicted him,
<br> he will certainly say:
<br> The evils are gone  away from me.
<br> Most surely he is exulting,
<br> boasting;
<br>
<a name = "verse11_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Except those who are patient and do good,
<br> they shall  have forgiveness and a great reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Then,
<br> it may be that you will give up part of what is  revealed to you and your breast will become straitened by it  because they say:
<br> Why has not a treasure been sent down upon  him or an angel come with him?
<br> You are only a warner;
<br> and  Allah is custodian over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> do they say:
<br> He has forged it.
<br> Say:
<br> Then bring ten  forged chapters like it and call upon whom you can besides  Allah,
<br> if you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.14</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they do not answer you,
<br> then know that it is  revealed by Allah's knowledge and that there is no god but  He;
<br> will you then submit?
<br>
<a name = "verse11_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever desires this world's life and its finery,
<br> We  will pay them in full their deeds therein,
<br> and they shall  not be made to.
<br> suffer loss in respect of them.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.16</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they for whom there is nothing but fire in the  hereafter,
<br> and what they wrought in it shall go for nothing,
<br>  and vain is what they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Is he then who has with him clear proof from his Lord,
<br>  and a witness from Him recites it and before it (is) the  Book of Musa,
<br> a guide and a mercy?
<br> These believe in it;
<br> and  whoever of the (different) parties disbelieves in it,
<br> surely  it is the truth from your Lord,
<br> but most men do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against  Allah?
<br> These shall be brought before their Lord,
<br> and the  witnesses shall say:
<br> These are they who lied against their  Lord.
<br> Now surely the curse of Allah is on the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Who turn away from the path of Allah and desire to make  it crooked;
<br> and they are disbelievers in the hereafter.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.20</b>]
<br>
<br> These shall not escape in the earth,
<br> nor shall they have  any guardians besides Allah;
<br> the punishment shall be doubled  for them,
<br> they could not bear to hear and they did not see.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.21</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they who have lost their souls,
<br> and what they  forged is gone from them.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Truly in the hereafter they are the greatest losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as to) those who believe and do good and humble  themselves to their Lord,
<br> these are the dwellers of the  garden,
<br> in it they will abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.24</b>]
<br>
<br> The likeness of the two parties is as the blind and the  deaf and the seeing and the hearing:
<br> are they equal in  condition?
<br> Will you not then mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse11_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent Nuh to his people:
<br> Surely I am a  plain warner for you:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.26</b>]
<br>
<br> That you shall not serve any but Allah,
<br> surely I fear  for you the punishment of a painful day.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.27</b>]
<br>
<br> But the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his  people said:
<br> We do not consider you but a mortal like  ourselves,
<br> and we do not see any have followed you but those  who are the meanest of us at first thought and we do not see  in you any excellence over us;
<br> nay,
<br> we deem you liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.28</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my people!
<br> tell me if I have with me clear  proof from my Lord,
<br> and He has granted me mercy from Himself  and it has been made obscure to you;
<br> shall we constrain you  to (accept) it while you are averse from it?
<br>
<a name = "verse11_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> O my people!
<br> I ask you not for wealth in return for  it;
<br> my reward is only with Allah and I am not going to drive  away those who believe;
<br> surely they shall meet their Lord,
<br>  but I consider you a people who are ignorant:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> O my people!
<br> who will help me against Allah if I  drive them away?
<br> Will you not then mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse11_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of  Allah and I do not know the unseen,
<br> nor do I say that I am  an angel,
<br> nor do I say about those whom your eyes hold in  mean estimation (that) Allah will never grant them (any)  good-- Allah knows best what is in their souls-- for then most  surely I should be of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.32</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Nuh!
<br> indeed you have disputed with us and  lengthened dispute with us,
<br> therefore bring to us what you  threaten us with,
<br> if you are of the truthful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.33</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Allah only will bring it to you if He please,
<br>  and you will not escape:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And if I intend to give you good advice,
<br> my advice will  not profit you if Allah intended that He should leave you to  go astray;
<br> He is your Lord,
<br> and to Him shall you be  returned.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they say:
<br> He has forged it?
<br> Say:
<br> If I have forged  it,
<br> on me is my guilt,
<br> and I am clear of that of which you  are guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And it was revealed to Nuh:
<br> That none of your people  will believe except those who have already believed,
<br>  therefore do not grieve at what they do:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And make the ark before Our eyes and (according to) Our  revelation,
<br> and do not speak to Me in respect of those who  are unjust;
<br> surely they shall be drowned.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And he began to make the ark;
<br> and whenever the chiefs  from among his people passed by him they laughed at him.
<br> He  said:
<br> If you laugh at us,
<br> surely we too laugh at you as you  laugh (at us).
<br>
<a name = "verse11_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.39</b>]
<br>
<br> So shall you know who it is on whom will come a  chastisement which will disgrace him,
<br> and on whom will  lasting chastisement come down.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when Our command came and water came forth from  the valley,
<br> We said:
<br> Carry in it two of all things,
<br> a pair,
<br>  and your own family-- except those against whom the word has  already gone forth,
<br> and those who believe.
<br> And there  believed not with him but a few.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And he said:
<br> Embark in it,
<br> in the name of Allah be its  sailing and its anchoring;
<br> most surely my Lord is Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And it moved on with them amid waves like mountains;
<br> and  Nuh called out to his son,
<br> and he was aloof:
<br> O my son!
<br>  embark with us and be not with the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.43</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I will betake myself for refuge to a mountain  that shall protect me from the water.
<br> Nuh said:
<br> There is no  protector today from Allah's punishment but He Who has  mercy;
<br> and a wave intervened between them,
<br> so he was of the  drowned.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And it was said:
<br> O earth,
<br> swallow down your water,
<br> and O  cloud,
<br> clear away;
<br> and the water was made to abate and the  affair was decided,
<br> and the ark rested on the Judi,
<br> and it  was said:
<br> Away with the unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And Nuh cried out to his Lord and said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> surely  my son is of my family,
<br> and Thy promise is surely true,
<br> and  Thou art the most just of the judges.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.46</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O Nuh!
<br> surely he is not of your family;
<br> surely  he is (the doer of) other than good deeds,
<br> therefore ask not  of Me that of which you have no knowledge;
 surely I admonish  you lest you may be of the ignorant<br>
<a name = "verse11_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.47</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> I seek refuge in Thee from asking Thee  that of which I have no knowledge;
<br> and if Thou shouldst not  forgive me and have mercy on me,
<br> I should be of the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.48</b>]
<br>
<br> It was said:
<br> O Nuh!
<br> descend with peace from Us and  blessings on you and on the people from among those who are  with you,
<br> and there shall be nations whom We will afford  provisions,
<br> then a painful punishment from Us shall afflict  them.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.49</b>]
<br>
<br> These are announcements relating to the unseen which We  reveal to you,
<br> you did not know them-- (neither) you nor your  people-- before this;
<br> therefore be patient;
<br> surely the end is  for those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse11_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hud.
<br> He said:
<br> O my  people!
<br> serve Allah,
<br> you have no god other than He;
<br> you are  nothing but forgers (of lies).
<br>
<a name = "verse11_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.51</b>]
<br>
<br> O my people!
<br> I do not ask of you any reward for it;
<br> my  reward is only with Him Who created me;
<br> do you not then  understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse11_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> O my people!
<br> ask forgiveness of your Lord,
<br> then  turn to Him;
<br> He will send on you clouds pouring down  abundance of rain and add strength to your strength,
<br> and do  not turn back guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.53</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Hud!
<br> you have not brought to us any clear  argument and we are not going to desert our gods for your  word,
<br> and we are not believers in you:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.54</b>]
<br>
<br> We cannot say aught but that some of our gods have  smitten you with evil.
<br> He said:
<br> Surely I call Allah to  witness,
<br> and do you bear witness too,
<br> that I am clear of  what you associate (with Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse11_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Besides Him,
<br> therefore scheme against me all together;
<br>  then give me no respite:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I rely on Allah,
<br> my Lord and your Lord;
<br> there is  no living creature but He holds it by its forelock;
<br> surely  my Lord is on the right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.57</b>]
<br>
<br> But if you turn back,
<br> then indeed I have delivered to  you the message with which I have been sent to you,
<br> and my  Lord will bring another people in your place,
<br> and you cannot  do Him any harm;
<br> surely my Lord is the Preserver of all  things.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our decree came to pass,
<br> We delivered Hud and  those who believed with him with mercy from Us,
<br> and We  delivered them from a hard chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And this was Ad;
<br> they denied the communications of their  Lord,
<br> and disobeyed His apostles and followed the bidding of  every insolent opposer (of truth).
<br>
<a name = "verse11_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And they were overtaken by curse in this world and on  the resurrection day;
<br> now surely Ad disbelieved in their  Lord;
<br> now surely,
<br> away with Ad,
<br> the people of Hud.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Samood (We sent) their brother Salih.
<br> He said:
<br> O  my people!
<br> serve Allah,
<br> you have no god other than He;
<br> He  brought you into being from the earth,
<br> and made you dwell in  it,
<br> therefore ask forgiveness of Him,
<br> then turn to Him;
<br>  surely my Lord is Nigh,
<br> Answering.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.62</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Salih!
<br> surely you were one amongst us in  whom great expectations were placed before this;
<br> do you  (now) forbid us from worshipping what our fathers  worshipped?
<br> And as to that which you call us to,
<br> most surely  we are in disquieting doubt.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.63</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my people!
<br> tell me if I have clear proof from  my Lord and He has granted to me mercy from Himself-- who will  then help me against Allah if I disobey Him?
<br> Therefore you  do not add to me other than loss:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.64</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> O my people!
<br> this will be (as) Allah's she-camel  for you,
<br> a sign;
<br> therefore leave her to pasture on Allah's  earth and do not touch her with evil,
<br> for then a near  chastisement will overtake you.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.65</b>]
<br>
<br> But they slew her,
<br> so he said:
<br> Enjoy yourselves in your  abode for three days,
<br> that is a promise not to be belied.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.66</b>]
<br>
<br> So when Our decree came to pass,
<br> We delivered Salih and  those who believed with him by mercy from Us,
<br> and (We saved  them) from the disgrace of that day;
<br> surely your Lord is the  Strong,
<br> the Mighty.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And the rumbling overtook those who were unjust,
<br> so they  became motionless bodies in their abodes,
<br>
<a name = "verse11_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.68</b>]
<br>
<br> As though they had never dwelt in them;
<br> now surely did  Samood disbelieve in their Lord;
<br> now surely,
<br> away with  Samood.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly Our messengers came to Ibrahim with good  news.
<br> They said:
<br> Peace.
<br> Peace,
<br> said he,
<br> and he made no delay  in bringing a roasted calf.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.70</b>]
<br>
<br> But when he saw that their hands were not extended  towards it,
<br> he deemed them strange and conceived fear of  them.
<br> .
<br> They said:
<br> Fear not,
<br> surely we are sent to Lut's  people.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And his wife was standing (by),
<br> so she laughed,
<br> then We  gave her the good news of Ishaq and after Ishaq of (a son's  son) Yaqoub.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.72</b>]
<br>
<br> She said:
<br> O wonder!
<br> shall I bear a son when I am an  extremely old woman and this my husband an extremely old  man?
<br> Most surely this is a wonderful thing.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.73</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Do you wonder at Allah's bidding?
<br> The mercy  of Allah and His blessings are on you,
<br> O people of the  house,
<br> surely He is Praised,
<br> Glorious.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.74</b>]
<br>
<br> So when fear had gone away from Ibrahim and good news  came to him,
<br> he began to plead with Us for Lut's people.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.75</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely Ibrahim was forbearing,
<br> tender-hearted,
<br>  oft-returning (to Allah):
<br>
<a name = "verse11_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.76</b>]
<br>
<br> O Ibrahim!
<br> leave off this,
<br> surely the decree of your  Lord has come to pass,
<br> and surely there must come to them a  chastisement that cannot be averted.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.77</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our messengers came to Lut,
<br> he was grieved for  them,
<br> and he lacked strength to protect them,
<br> and said:
<br> This  is a hard day.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And his people came to him,
<br> (as if) rushed on towards  him,
<br> and already they did evil deeds.
<br> He said:
<br> O my people!
<br>  these are my daughters-- they are purer for you,
<br> so guard  against (the punishment of) Allah and do not disgrace me  with regard to my guests;
<br> is there not among you one  right-minded man?
<br>
<a name = "verse11_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.79</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Certainly you know that we have no claim on  your daughters,
<br> and most surely you know what we desire.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.80</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Ah!
<br> that I had power to suppress you,
<br> rather I  shall have recourse to a strong support.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.81</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Lut!
<br> we are the messengers of your Lord;
<br>  they shall by no means reach you;
<br> so remove your followers  in a part of the night-- and let none of you turn back-- except  your wife,
<br> for surely whatsoever befalls them shall befall  her;
<br> surely their appointed time is the morning;
<br> is not the  morning nigh?
<br>
<a name = "verse11_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.82</b>]
<br>
<br> So when Our decree came to pass,
<br> We turned them upside  down and rained down upon them stones,
<br> of what had been  decreed,
<br> one after another.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.83</b>]
<br>
<br> Marked (for punishment) with your Lord and it is not far  off from the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.84</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shu'aib.
<br> He said:
<br>  O my people!
<br> serve Allah,
<br> you have no god other than He,
<br> and  do not give short measure and weight:
<br> surely I see you in  prosperity and surely I fear for you the punishment of an  all-encompassing day.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.85</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> O my people!
<br> give full measure and weight fairly,
<br>  and defraud not men their things,
<br> and do not act corruptly  in the land,
<br> making mischief:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.86</b>]
<br>
<br> What remains with Allah is better for you if you are  believers,
<br> and I am not a keeper over you.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.87</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Shu'aib!
<br> does your prayer enjoin you that  we should forsake what our fathers worshipped or that we  should not do what we please with regard to our property?
<br>  Forsooth you are the forbearing,
<br> the right-directing one.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.88</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my people!
<br> have you considered if I have a  clear proof from my Lord and He has given me a goodly  sustenance from Himself,
<br> and I do not desire that in  opposition to you I should betake myself to that which I  forbid you:
<br> I desire nothing but reform so far as I am able,
<br>  and with none but Allah is the direction of my affair to a  right issue;
<br> on Him do I rely and to Him do I turn:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.89</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> O my people!
<br> let not opposition to me make you  guilty so that there may befall you the like of what befell  the people of Nuh,
<br> or the people of Hud,
<br> or the people of  Salih,
<br> nor are the people of Lut far off from you;
<br>
<a name = "verse11_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.90</b>]
<br>
<br> And ask forgiveness of your Lord,
<br> then turn to Him;
<br>  surely my Lord is Merciful,
<br> Loving-kind.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.91</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Shu'aib!
<br> we do not understand much of what  you say and most surely we see you to be weak among us,
<br> and  were it not for your family we would surely stone you,
<br> and  you are not mighty against us.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.92</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my people!
<br> is my family more esteemed by you  than Allah?
<br> And you neglect Him as a thing cast behind your  back;
<br> surely my Lord encompasses what you do:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.93</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> O my people!
<br> act according to your ability,
<br> I too  am acting;
<br> you will come to know soon who it is on whom will  light the punishment that will disgrace him and who it is  that is a liar,
<br> and watch,
<br> surely I too am watching with  you.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.94</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our decree came to pass We delivered Shu'aib,
<br>  and those who believed with him by mercy from Us,
<br> and the  rumbling overtook those who were unjust so they became  motionless bodies in their abodes,
<br>
<a name = "verse11_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.95</b>]
<br>
<br> As though they had never dwelt in them;
<br> now surely  perdition overtook Madyan as had perished Samood.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.96</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and a  clear authority,
<br>
<a name = "verse11_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.97</b>]
<br>
<br> To Firon and his chiefs,
<br> but they followed the bidding  of Firon,
<br> and Firon's bidding was not right-directing.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.98</b>]
<br>
<br> He shall lead his people on the resurrection day,
<br> and  bring them down to the fire;
<br> and evil the place to which  they are brought.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.99</b>]
<br>
<br> And they are overtaken by curse in this (world),
<br> and on  the resurrection day,
<br> evil the gift which shall be given.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.100</b>]
<br>
<br> This is an account of (the fate of) the towns which We  relate to you;
<br> of them are some that stand and (others) mown  down.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.101</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not do them injustice,
<br> but they were unjust  to themselves,
<br> so their gods whom they called upon besides  Allah did not avail them aught when the decree of your Lord  came to pass;
<br> and they added but to their ruin.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.102</b>]
<br>
<br> And such is the punishment of your Lord when He  punishes the towns while they are unjust;
<br> surely His  punishment is painful,
<br> severe.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.103</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is a sign in this for him who fears  the chastisement of the hereafter;
<br> this is a day on which  the people shall be gathered together and this is a day that  shall be witnessed.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.104</b>]
<br>
<br> And We do not delay it but to an appointed term.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.105</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when it shall come,
<br> no soul shall speak  except with His permission,
<br> then (some) of them shall be  unhappy and (others) happy.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.106</b>]
<br>
<br> So as to those who are unhappy,
<br> they shall be in the  fire;
<br> for them shall be sighing and groaning in it:
<br>
<a name = "verse11_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.107</b>]
<br>
<br> Abiding therein so long as the heavens and the earth  endure,
<br> except as your Lord please;
<br> surely your Lord is the  mighty doer of what He intends.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.108</b>]
<br>
<br> And as to those who are made happy,
<br> they shall be in  the garden,
<br> abiding in it as long as the heavens and the  earth endure,
<br> except as your Lord please;
<br> a gift which shall  never be cut off.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.109</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore be not in doubt as to what these worship;
<br>  they do not worship but as their fathers worshipped before;
<br>  and most surely We will pay them back in full their portion  undiminished.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.110</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave the book to Musa,
<br> but it was gone  against;
<br> and had not a word gone forth from your Lord,
<br> the  matter would surely have been decided between them;
<br> and  surely they are in a disquieting doubt about it.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.111</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord will most surely pay back to all their  deeds in full;
<br> surely He is aware of what they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_112"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.112</b>]
<br>
<br> Continue then in the right way as you are commanded,
<br> as  also he who has turned (to Allah) with you,
<br> and be not  inordinate (O men!
<br>),
<br> surely He sees what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_113"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.113</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not incline to those who are unjust,
<br> lest the  fire touch you,
<br> and you have no guardians besides Allah,
<br>  then you shall not be helped.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_114"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.114</b>]
<br>
<br> And keep up prayer in the two parts of the day and in  the first hours of the night;
<br> surely good deeds take away  evil deeds this is a reminder to the mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_115"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.115</b>]
<br>
<br> And be patient,
<br> for surely Allah does not waste the  reward of the good-doers.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_116"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.116</b>]
<br>
<br> But why were there not among the generations before you  those possessing understanding,
<br> who should have forbidden  the making of mischief in the earth,
<br> except a few of those  whom We delivered from among them?
<br> And those who were unjust  went after what they are made to enjoy of plenty,
<br> and they  were guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_117"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.117</b>]
<br>
<br> And it did not beseem your Lord to have destroyed the  towns tyrannously,
<br> while their people acted well.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_118"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.118</b>]
<br>
<br> And if your Lord had pleased He would certainly have  made people a single nation,
<br> and they shall continue to  differ.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_119"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.119</b>]
<br>
<br> Except those on whom your Lord has mercy;
<br> and for this  did He create them;
<br> and the word of your Lord is fulfilled:
<br>  Certainly I will fill hell with the jinn and the men,
<br> all  together.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_120"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.120</b>]
<br>
<br> And all we relate to you of the accounts of the  apostles is to strengthen your heart therewith;
<br> and in this  has come to you the truth and an admonition,
<br> and a reminder  to the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_121"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.121</b>]
<br>
<br> And say to those who do not believe:
<br> Act according to  your state;
<br> surely we too are acting.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_122"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.122</b>]
<br>
<br> And wait;
<br> surely we are waiting also.
<br>
<a name = "verse11_123"></a>
<p>
[<b>11.123</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's is the unseen in the heavens and the earth,
<br>  and to Him is returned the whole of the affair;
<br> therefore  serve Him and rely on Him,
<br> and your Lord is not heedless of  what you do.
