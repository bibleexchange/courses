<p><h3>Book 69</h3>
<br><h3>The Inevitable</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse69_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.1</b>]
<br>
<br> The sure calamity!
<br>
<a name = "verse69_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.2</b>]
<br>
<br> What is the sure calamity!
<br> And what would make you  realize what the sure calamity is!
<br>
<a name = "verse69_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Samood and Ad called the striking calamity a lie.
  <br>
<a name = "verse69_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Then as to Samood,
<br> they were destroyed by an excessively  severe punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And as to Ad,
<br> they were destroyed by a roaring,
<br> violent  blast.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Which He made to prevail against them for seven nights  and eight days unremittingly,
<br> so that you might have seen  the people therein prostrate as if they were the trunks of  hollow palms.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you then see of them one remaining?
<br>
<a name = "verse69_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon and those before him and the overthrown cities  continuously committed sins.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And they disobeyed the Apostle of their Lord,
<br> so He  punished them with a vehement punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We bore you up in the ship when the water rose  high,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.12</b>]
<br>
<br> So that We may make it a reminder to you,
<br> and that the  retaining ear might retain it.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the trumpet is blown with a single blast,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And the earth and the mountains are borne away and  crushed with a single crushing.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.15</b>]
<br>
<br> On that day shall the great event come to pass,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And the heaven shall cleave asunder,
<br> so that on that day  it shall be frail,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And the angels shall be on the sides thereof;
<br> and above  ) I them eight shall bear on that day your Lord's power.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.18</b>]
<br>
<br> On that day you shall be exposed to view-- no secret of  yours shall remain hidden.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand,
<br>  he will say:
<br> Lo!
<br> read my book:
<br>
<a name = "verse69_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I knew that I shall meet my account.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.21</b>]
<br>
<br> So he shall be in a life of pleasure,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.22</b>]
<br>
<br> In a lofty garden,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.23</b>]
<br>
<br> The fruits of which are near at hand:
<br>
<a name = "verse69_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Eat and drink pleasantly for what you did beforehand in  the days gone by.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for him who is given his book in his left hand he  shall say:
<br> O would that my book had never been given me:
<br>
<a name = "verse69_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And I had not known what my account was:
<br>
<a name = "verse69_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.27</b>]
<br>
<br> O would that it had made an end (of me):
<br>
<a name = "verse69_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.28</b>]
<br>
<br> My wealth has availed me nothing:
<br>
<a name = "verse69_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.29</b>]
<br>
<br> My authority is gone away from me.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Lay hold on him,
<br> then put a chain on him,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Then cast him into the burning fire,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Then thrust him into a chain the length of which is  seventy cubits.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely he did not believe in Allah,
<br> the Great,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor did he urge the feeding of the poor.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore he has not here today a true friend,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor any food except refuse,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Which none but the wrongdoers eat.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.38</b>]
<br>
<br> But nay!
<br> I swear by that which you see,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And that which you do not see.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely,
<br> it is the Word brought by an honored  Apostle,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is not the word of a poet;
<br> little is it that you  believe;
<br>
<a name = "verse69_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor the word of a soothsayer;
<br> little is it that you  mind.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.43</b>]
<br>
<br> It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And if he had fabricated against Us some of the sayings,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.45</b>]
<br>
<br> We would certainly have seized him by the right hand,
<br>
<a name = "verse69_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We would certainly have cut off his aorta.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And not one of you could have withheld Us from him.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely it is a reminder for those who guard  (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse69_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely We know that some of you are rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely it is a great grief to the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse69_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.51</b>]
<br>
 And most surely it is the true certainty<br>
<a name = "verse69_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>69.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore-glorify the name of your Lord,
<br> the Great.
