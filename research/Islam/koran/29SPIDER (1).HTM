<p><h3>Book 29</h3>
<br><h3>The Spider</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse29_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Do men think that they will be left alone on saying,
<br> We  believe,
<br> and not be tried?
<br>
<a name = "verse29_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We tried those before them,
<br> so Allah will  certainly know those who are true and He will certainly know  the liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they who work evil think that they will escape Us?
<br>  Evil is it that they judge!
<br>
<a name = "verse29_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever hopes to meet Allah,
<br> the term appointed by Allah  will then most surely come;
<br> and He is the Hearing,
<br> the  Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever strives hard,
<br> he strives only for his own  soul;
<br> most surely Allah is Self-sufficient,
<br> above (need of)  the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who believe and do good,
<br> We will most  certainly do away with their evil deeds and We will most  certainly reward them the best of what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have enjoined on man goodness to his parents,
<br> and  if they contend with you that you should associate (others)  with Me,
<br> of which you have no knowledge,
<br> do not obey them,
<br>  to Me is your return,
<br> so I will inform you of what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who believe and do good,
<br> We will most  surely cause them to enter among the good.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And among men is he who says:
<br> We believe in Allah;
<br> but  when he is persecuted in (the way of) Allah he thinks the  persecution of men to be as the chastisement of Allah;
<br> and  if there come assistance from your Lord,
<br> they would most  certainly say:
<br> Surely we were with you.
<br> What!
<br> is not Allah  the best knower of what is in the breasts of mankind.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And most certainly Allah will know those who believe and  most certainly He will know the hypocrites.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say to those who believe:
<br>  Follow our path and we will bear your wrongs.
<br> And never  shall they be the bearers of any of their wrongs;
<br> most  surely they are liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And most certainly they shall carry their own burdens,
<br>  and other burdens with their own burdens,
<br> and most certainly  they shall be questioned on the resurrection day as to what  they forged.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent Nuh to his people,
<br> so he remained  among them a thousand years save fifty years.
<br> And the deluge  overtook them,
<br> while they were unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.15</b>]
<br>
<br> So We delivered him and the inmates of the ark,
<br> and made  it a sign to the nations.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And (We sent) Ibrahim,
<br> when he said to his people:
<br> Serve  Allah and be careful of (your duty to) Him;
<br> this is best for  you,
<br> if you did but know:
<br>
<a name = "verse29_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.17</b>]
<br>
<br> You only worship idols besides Allah and you create a  lie surely they whom you serve besides Allah do not control  for you any sustenance,
<br> therefore seek the sustenance from  Allah and serve Him and be grateful to Him;
<br> to Him you shall  be brought back.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you reject (the truth),
<br> nations before you did  indeed reject (the truth);
<br> and nothing is incumbent on the  apostle but a plain delivering (of the message).
<br>
<a name = "verse29_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.19</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do they not consider how Allah originates the  creation,
<br> then reproduces it?
<br> Surely that is easy to Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Travel in the earth and see how He makes the first  creation,
<br> then Allah creates the latter creation;
<br> surely  Allah has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.21</b>]
<br>
<br> He punishes whom He pleases and has mercy on whom He  pleases,
<br> and to Him you shall be turned back.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And you shall not escape in the earth nor in the heaven,
<br>  and you have neither a protector nor a helper besides Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as to) those who disbelieve in the communications  of Allah and His meeting,
<br> they have despaired of My mercy,
<br>  and these it is that shall have a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.24</b>]
<br>
<br> So naught was the answer of his people except that they  said:
<br> Slay him or burn him;
<br> then Allah delivered him from  the fire;
<br> most surely there are signs in this for a people  who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And he said:
<br> You have only taken for yourselves idols  besides Allah by way of friendship between you in this  world's life,
<br> then on the resurrection day some of you shall  deny others,
<br> and some of you shall curse others,
<br> and your  abode is the fire,
<br> and you shall not have any helpers.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And Lut believed in Him,
<br> and he said:
<br> I am fleeing to my  Lord,
<br> surely He is the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And We granted him Ishaq and Yaqoub,
<br> and caused the t  prophethood and the book to remain in his seed,
<br> and We gave  him his reward in this world,
<br> and in the hereafter he will  most surely be among the good.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And (We sent) Lut when he said to his people:
<br> Most  surely you are guilty of an indecency which none of the  nations has ever done before you;
<br>
<a name = "verse29_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.29</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do you come to the males and commit robbery on the  highway,
<br> and you commit evil deeds in your assemblies?
<br> But  nothing was the answer of his people except that they said:
<br>  Bring on us Allah's punishment,
<br> if you are one of the  truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.30</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> help me against the mischievous  people.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our messengers came to Ibrahim with the good  news,
<br> they said:
<br> Surely we are going to destroy the people  of this town,
<br> for its people are unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.32</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely in it is Lut.
<br> They said:
<br> We know well  who is in it;
<br> we shall certainly deliver him and his  followers,
<br> except his wife;
<br> she shall be of those who remain  behind.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our messengers came to Lut he was grieved on  account of them,
<br> and he felt powerless (to protect) them;
<br>  and they said:
<br> Fear not,
<br> nor grieve;
<br> surely we will deliver  you and your followers,
<br> except your wife;
<br> she shall be of  those who remain behind.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We will cause to come down upon the people of  this town a punishment from heaven,
<br> because they  transgressed.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have left a clear sign of it for a  people who understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shuaib,
<br> so he  said:
<br> O my people!
<br> serve Allah and fear the latter day and  do not act corruptly in the land,
<br> making mischief.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.37</b>]
<br>
<br> But they rejected him,
<br> so a severe earthquake overtook  them,
<br> and they became motionless bodies in their abode.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And (We destroyed) Ad and Samood,
<br> and from their  dwellings (this) is apparent to you indeed;
<br> and the Shaitan  made their deeds fair-seeming to them,
<br> so he kept them back  from the path,
<br> though they were endowed with intelligence  and skill,
<br>
<a name = "verse29_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And (We destroyed) Qaroun and Firon and Haman;
<br> and  certainly Musa came to them with clear arguments,
<br> but they  behaved haughtily in the land;
<br> yet they could not outstrip  (Us).
<br>
<a name = "verse29_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.40</b>]
<br>
<br> So each We punished for his sin;
<br> of them was he on whom  We sent down a violent storm,
<br> and of them was he whom the  rumbling overtook,
<br> and of them was he whom We made to be  swallowed up by the earth,
<br> and of them was he whom We  drowned;
<br> and it did not beseem Allah that He should be  unjust to them,
<br> but they were unjust to their own souls.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.41</b>]
<br>
<br> The parable of those who take guardians besides Allah is  as the parable of the spider that makes for itself a house;
<br>  and most surely the frailest of the houses is the spider's  house did they but know.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah knows whatever thing they call upon besides  Him;
<br> and He is the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) these examples,
<br> We set them forth for men,
<br>  and none understand them but the learned.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth;
<br> most  surely there is a sign in this for the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Recite that which has been revealed to you of the Book  and keep up prayer;
<br> surely prayer keeps (one) away from  indecency and evil,
<br> and certainly the remembrance of Allah  is the greatest,
<br> and Allah knows what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not dispute with the followers of the Book except  by what is best,
<br> except those of them who act unjustly,
<br> and  say:
<br> We believe in that which has been revealed to us and  revealed to you,
<br> and our God and your God is One,
<br> and to Him  do we submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus have We revealed the Book to you.
<br> So those whom  We have given the Book believe in it,
<br> and of these there are  those who believe in it,
<br> and none deny Our communications  except the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And you did not recite before it any book,
<br> nor did you  transcribe one with your right hand,
<br> for then could those  who say untrue things have doubted.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> these are clear communications in the breasts of  those who are granted knowledge;
<br> and none deny Our  communications except the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Why are not signs sent down upon him from  his Lord?
<br> Say:
<br> The signs are only with Allah,
<br> and I am only  a plain warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.51</b>]
<br>
<br> Is it not enough for them that We have revealed to you  the Book which is recited to them?
<br> Most surely there is  mercy in this and a reminder for a people who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and  you;
<br> He knows what is in the heavens and the earth.
<br> And (as  for) those who believe in the falsehood and disbelieve in  Allah,
<br> these it is that are the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And they ask you to hasten on the chastisement;
<br> and had  not a term been appointed,
<br> the chastisement would certainly  have come to them;
<br> and most certainly it will come to them  all of a sudden while they will not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.54</b>]
<br>
<br> They ask you to hasten on the chastisement,
<br> and most  surely hell encompasses the unbelievers;
<br>
<a name = "verse29_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.55</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when the chastisement shall cover them from  above them,
<br> and from beneath their feet;
<br> and He shall say:
<br>  Taste what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.56</b>]
<br>
<br> O My servants who believe!
<br> surely My earth is vast,
<br>  therefore Me alone should you serve.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Every soul must taste of death,
<br> then to Us you shall be  brought back.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who believe and do good,
<br> We will  certainly give them abode in the high places in gardens  beneath which rivers flow,
<br> abiding therein;
<br> how good the  reward of the workers:
<br>
<a name = "verse29_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who are patient,
<br> and on their Lord do they rely.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many a living creature that does not carry its  sustenance:
<br> Allah sustains it and yourselves;
<br> and He is the  Hearing,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you ask them,
<br> Who created the heavens and the  earth and made the sun and the moon subservient,
<br> they will  certainly say,
<br> Allah.
<br> Whence are they then turned away?
<br>
<a name = "verse29_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.62</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah makes abundant the means of subsistence for whom  He pleases of His servants,
<br> and straitens them for whom (He  pleases) surely Allah is Cognizant of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.63</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you ask them Who is it that sends down water from  the clouds,
<br> then gives life to the earth with it after its  death,
<br> they will certainly say,
<br> Allah.
<br> Say:
<br> All praise is  due to Allah.
<br> Nay,
<br> most of them do not understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.64</b>]
<br>
<br> And this life of the world is nothing but a sport and a  play;
<br> and as for the next abode,
<br> that most surely is the  life-- did they but know!
<br>
<a name = "verse29_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.65</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they ride in the ships they call upon Allah,
<br>  being sincerely obedient to Him,
<br> but when He brings them  safe to the land,
<br> lo!
<br> they associate others (with Him);
<br>
<a name = "verse29_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus they become ungrateful for what We have given them,
<br>  so that they may enjoy;
<br> but they shall soon know.
<br>
<a name = "verse29_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.67</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not see that We have made a sacred territory  secure,
<br> while men are carried off by force from around them?
<br>  Will they still believe in the falsehood and disbelieve in  the favour of Allah?
<br>
<a name = "verse29_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And who is more unjust than one who forges a lie against  Allah,
<br> or gives the lie to the truth when it has come to  him?
<br> Will not in hell be the abode of the unbelievers?
<br>
<a name = "verse29_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>29.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who strive hard for Us,
<br> We will most  certainly guide them in Our ways;
<br> and Allah is most surely  with the doers of good.
