<p><h3>Book 75</h3>
<br><h3>The Resurrection</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse75_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> I swear by the day of resurrection.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> I swear by the self-accusing soul.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Does man think that We shall not gather his bones?
<br>
<a name = "verse75_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Yea!
 We are able to make complete his very fingertips  <br>
<a name = "verse75_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Nay!
<br> man desires to give the lie to what is before him.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.6</b>]
<br>
<br> He asks:
<br> When is the day of resurrection?
<br>
<a name = "verse75_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.7</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the sight becomes dazed,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And the moon becomes dark,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And the sun and the moon are brought together,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Man shall say on that day:
<br> Whither to fly to?
<br>
<a name = "verse75_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.11</b>]
<br>
<br> By no means!
<br> there shall be no place of refuge!
<br>
<a name = "verse75_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.12</b>]
<br>
<br> With your Lord alone shall on that.
<br>day be the place of  rest.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Man shall on that day be informed of what he sent before  and (what he) put off.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> man is evidence against himself,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Though he puts forth his excuses.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Do not move your tongue with it to make haste with it,
<br>    17:
<br> Surely on Us (devolves) the collecting of it and the  reciting of it.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore when We have recited it,
<br> follow its  recitation.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Again on Us (devolves) the explaining of it.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> But you love the present life,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And neglect the hereafter.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.22</b>]
<br>
<br> (Some) faces on that day shall be bright,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Looking to their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And (other) faces on that day shall be gloomy,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Knowing that there will be made to befall them some  great calamity.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> When it comes up to the throat,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is said:
<br> Who will be a magician?
<br>
<a name = "verse75_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.28</b>]
<br>
 And he is sure that it is the (hour of) parting<br>
<a name = "verse75_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And affliction is combined with affliction;
<br>
<a name = "verse75_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.30</b>]
<br>
<br> To your Lord on that day shall be the driving.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.31</b>]
<br>
<br> So he did not accept the truth,
<br> nor did he pray,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.32</b>]
<br>
<br> But called the truth a lie and turned back,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he went to his followers,
<br> walking away in  haughtiness.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Nearer to you (is destruction) and nearer,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Again (consider how) nearer to you and nearer.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Does man think that he is to be left to wander without  an aim?
<br>
<a name = "verse75_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Was he not a small seed in the seminal elements,
<br>
<a name = "verse75_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he was a clot of blood,
<br> so He created (him) then  made (him) perfect.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Then He made of him two kinds,
<br> the male and the female.
<br>
<a name = "verse75_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>75.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Is not He able to give life to the dead?
