<p><h3>Book 53</h3>
<br><h3>The Star</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse53_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.1</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the star when it goes down.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Your companion does not err,
<br> nor does he go astray;
<br>
<a name = "verse53_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor does he speak out of desire.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.4</b>]
<br>
<br> It is naught but revelation that is revealed,
  <br>
<a name = "verse53_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  The Lord of Mighty Power has taught him,
<br>
<a name = "verse53_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.6</b>]
<br>
<br> The Lord of Strength;
<br> so he attained completion,
<br>
<a name = "verse53_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And he is in the highest part of the horizon.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he drew near,
 then he bowed<br>
<a name = "verse53_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.9</b>]
<br>
<br> So he was the measure of two bows or closer still.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And He revealed to His servant what He revealed.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.11</b>]
<br>
<br> The heart was not untrue in (making him see) what he  saw.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.12</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do you then dispute with him as to what he saw?
<br>
<a name = "verse53_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly he saw him in another descent,
<br>
<a name = "verse53_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.14</b>]
<br>
<br> At the farthest lote-tree;
<br>
<a name = "verse53_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Near which is the garden,
<br> the place to be resorted to.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.16</b>]
<br>
<br> When that which covers covered the lote-tree;
<br>
<a name = "verse53_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.17</b>]
<br>
<br> The eye did not turn aside,
<br> nor did it exceed the limit.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly he saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you then considered the Lat and the Uzza,
<br>
<a name = "verse53_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And Manat,
<br> the third,
<br> the last?
<br>
<a name = "verse53_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.21</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> for you the males and for Him the females!
<br>
<a name = "verse53_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.22</b>]
<br>
<br> This indeed is an unjust division!
<br>
<a name = "verse53_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.23</b>]
<br>
<br> They are naught but names which you have named,
<br> you and  your fathers;
<br> Allah has not sent for them any authority.
<br>  They follow naught but conjecture and the low desires which  (their) souls incline to;
<br> and certainly the guidance has  come to them from their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Or shall man have what he wishes?
<br>
<a name = "verse53_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> for Allah is the hereafter and the former (life).
<br>
<a name = "verse53_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many an angel is there in the heavens whose  intercession does not avail at all except after Allah has  given permission to whom He pleases and chooses.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely they who do not believe in the hereafter  name the angels with female names.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And they have no knowledge of it;
<br> they do not follow  anything but conjecture,
<br> and surely conjecture does not  avail against the truth at all.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore turn aside from him who turns his back upon  Our reminder and does not desire anything but this world's  life.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.30</b>]
<br>
<br> That is their goal of knowledge;
<br> surely your Lord knows  best him who goes astray from His path and He knows best him  who follows the right direction.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's is what is in the heavens and what is in the  earth,
<br> that He may reward those who do evil according to  what they do,
<br> and (that) He may reward those who do good  with goodness.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who keep aloof from the great sins and the  indecencies but the passing idea;
<br> surely your Lord is  liberal in forgiving.
<br> He knows you best when He brings you  forth from the earth and when you are embryos in the wombs  of your mothers;
<br> therefore do not attribute purity to your  souls;
<br> He knows him best who guards (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse53_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you then seen him who turns his back?
<br>
<a name = "verse53_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And gives a little and (then) withholds.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Has he the knowledge of the unseen so that he can see?
<br>
<a name = "verse53_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> has he not been informed of what is in the  scriptures of Musa?
<br>
<a name = "verse53_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And (of) Ibrahim who fulfilled (the commandments):
<br>
<a name = "verse53_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.38</b>]
<br>
 That no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of  another-<br>
<a name = "verse53_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.39</b>]
<br>
 And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for-<br>
<a name = "verse53_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.40</b>]
<br>
 And that his striving shall soon be seen-<br>
<a name = "verse53_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.41</b>]
<br>
 Then shall he be rewarded for it with the fullest  reward-<br>
<a name = "verse53_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.42</b>]
<br>
 And that to your Lord is the goal-<br>
<a name = "verse53_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And that He it is Who makes (men) laugh and makes (them)  weep;
<br>
<a name = "verse53_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.44</b>]
<br>
 And that He it is Who causes death and gives life-<br>
<a name = "verse53_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And that He created pairs,
 the male and the female<br>
<a name = "verse53_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.46</b>]
<br>
 From the small seed when it is adapted<br>
<a name = "verse53_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And that on Him is the bringing forth a second time;
<br>
<a name = "verse53_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And that He it is Who enriches and gives to hold;
<br>
<a name = "verse53_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And that He is the Lord of the Sirius;
<br>
<a name = "verse53_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.50</b>]
<br>
 And that He did destroy the Ad of old<br>
<a name = "verse53_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And Samood,
 so He spared not<br>
<a name = "verse53_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And the people of Nuh before;
<br> surely they were most  unjust and inordinate;
<br>
<a name = "verse53_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And the overthrown cities did He overthrow,
<br>
<a name = "verse53_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.54</b>]
<br>
<br> So there covered them that which covered.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.55</b>]
<br>
<br>  Which of your Lord's benefits will you then dispute  about?
<br>
<a name = "verse53_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.56</b>]
<br>
<br> This is a warner of the warners of old.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.57</b>]
<br>
<br> The near event draws nigh.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.58</b>]
<br>
<br> There shall be none besides Allah to remove it.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you then wonder at this announcement?
<br>
<a name = "verse53_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And will you laugh and not weep?
<br>
<a name = "verse53_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.61</b>]
<br>
<br> While you are indulging in varieties.
<br>
<a name = "verse53_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>53.62</b>]
<br>
<br> So make obeisance to Allah and serve (Him).
