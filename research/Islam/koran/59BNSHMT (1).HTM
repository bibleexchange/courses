<p><h3>Book 59</h3>
<br><h3>The Banishment</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent the Merciful.
      </p>
<a name = "verse59_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth  declares the glory of Allah,
<br> and He is the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.2</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who caused those who disbelieved of the  followers of the Book to go forth from their homes at the  first banishment you did not think that they would go forth,
<br>  while they were certain that their fortresses would defend  them against Allah;
<br> but Allah came to them whence they did  not expect,
<br> and cast terror into their hearts;
<br> they  demolished their houses with their own hands and the hands  of the believers;
<br> therefore take a lesson,
<br> O you who have  eyes!
<br>
<a name = "verse59_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And had it not been that Allah had decreed for them the  exile,
<br> He would certainly have punished them in this world,
<br>  and m the hereafter they shall have chastisement of the  fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.4</b>]
<br>
<br> That is because they acted in opposition to Allah and His  Apostle,
<br> and whoever acts in opposition to Allah,
<br> then  surely Allah is severe in retributing (evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse59_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Whatever palm-tree you cut down or leave standing upon  its roots,
<br> It 15 by Allah's command,
<br> and that He may abase  the transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And whatever Allah restored to His Apostle from them you  did not press forward against it any horse or a riding camel  but Allah gives authority to His apostles against whom He  pleases,
<br> and Allah has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Whatever Allah has restored to His Apostle from the  people of the towns,
<br> it is for Allah and for the Apostle,
<br>  and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and  the wayfarer,
<br> so that it may not be a thing taken by turns  among the rich of you,
<br> and whatever the Apostle gives you,
<br>  accept it,
<br> and from whatever he forbids you,
<br> keep back,
<br> and  be careful of (your duty to) Allah;
<br> surely Allah is severe  in retributing (evil):
<br>
<a name = "verse59_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.8</b>]
<br>
<br> (It is) for the poor who fled their homes and their  possessions,
<br> seeking grace of Allah and (His) pleasure,
<br> and  assisting Allah and His Apostle:
<br> these it is that are the  truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who made their abode in the city and in the  faith before them love those who have fled to them,
<br> and do  not find in their hearts a need of what they are given,
<br> and  prefer (them) before themselves though poverty may afflict  them,
<br> and whoever is preserved from the niggardliness of his  soul,
<br> these it is that are the successful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who come after them say:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> forgive us  and those of our brethren who had precedence of us in faith,
<br>  and do not allow any spite to remain in our hearts towards  those who believe,
<br> our Lord!
<br> surely Thou art Kind,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not seen those who have become hypocrites?
<br> They  say to those of their brethren who disbelieve from among the  followers of the Book:
<br> If you are driven forth,
<br> we shall  certainly go forth with you,
<br> and we will never obey any one  concerning you,
<br> and if you are fought against,
<br> we will  certainly help you,
<br> and Allah bears witness that they are  most surely liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly if these are driven forth,
<br> they will not go  forth with them,
<br> and if they are fought against,
<br> they will  not help them,
<br> and even if they help-them,
<br> they will  certainly turn (their) backs,
<br> then they shall not be helped.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.13</b>]
<br>
<br> You are certainly greater in being feared in their  hearts than Allah;
 that is because they are a people who do  not understand<br>
<a name = "verse59_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.14</b>]
<br>
<br> They will not fight against you in a body save in  fortified towns or from behind walls;
<br> their fighting between  them is severe,
<br> you may think them as one body,
<br> and their  hearts are disunited;
<br> that is because they are a people who  have no sense.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Like those before them shortly;
<br> they tasted the evil  result of their affair,
<br> and they shall have a painful  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Like the Shaitan when he says to man:
<br> Disbelieve,
<br> but  when he disbelieves,
<br> he says:
<br> I am surely clear of you;
<br>  surely I fear Allah,
<br> the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore the end of both of them is that they are both  in the fire to abide therein,
<br> and that is the reward of the  unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.18</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> be careful of (your duty to) Allah,
<br>  and let every soul consider what it has sent on for the  morrow,
<br> and be careful of (your duty to) Allah;
<br> surely Allah  is Aware of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And be not like those who forsook Allah,
<br> so He made them  forsake their own souls:
<br> these it is that are the  transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Not alike are the inmates of the fire and the dwellers  of the garden:
<br> the dwellers of the garden are they that are  the achievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Had We sent down this Quran on a mountain,
<br> you would  certainly have seen it falling down,
<br> splitting asunder  because of the fear of Allah,
<br> and We set forth these  parables to men that they may reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse59_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.22</b>]
<br>
<br> He is Allah besides Whom there is no god;
<br> the Knower of  the unseen and the seen;
<br> He is the Beneficent,
 the Merciful<br>
<a name = "verse59_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.23</b>]
<br>
<br> He is Allah,
<br> besides Whom there is no god;
<br> the King,
<br> the  Holy,
<br> the Giver of peace,
<br> the Granter of security,
<br> Guardian  over all,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the Supreme,
<br> the Possessor of every  greatness Glory be to Allah from what they set up (with  Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse59_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>59.24</b>]
<br>
<br> He is Allah the Creator,
<br> the Maker,
<br> the Fashioner;
<br> His  are the most excellent names;
<br> whatever is in the heavens and  the earth declares His glory;
<br> and He is the Mighty,
<br> the  Wise.
