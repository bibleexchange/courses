<p><h3>Book 61</h3>
<br><h3>The Ranks</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse61_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth  declares the glory of Allah;
<br> and He is the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse61_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.2</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> why do you say that which you do not  do?
<br>
<a name = "verse61_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.3</b>]
<br>
<br> It is most hateful to Allah that you should say that  which you do not do.
<br>
<a name = "verse61_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah loves those who fight in His way in ranks as  if they were a firm and compact wall.
<br>
<a name = "verse61_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Musa said to his people:
<br> O my people!
<br> why do you  give me trouble?
<br> And you know indeed that I am Allah's  apostle to you;
<br> but when they turned aside,
<br> Allah made their  hearts turn aside,
<br> and Allah does not guide the  transgressing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse61_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Isa son of Marium said:
<br> O children of Israel!
<br>  surely I am the apostle of Allah to you,
<br> verifying that  which is before me of the Taurat and giving the good news of  an Apostle who will come after me,
<br> his name being Ahmad,
<br> but  when he came to them with clear arguments they said:
<br> This is  clear magic.
<br>
<a name = "verse61_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against  Allah and he is invited to Islam,
<br> and Allah does not guide  the unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse61_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.8</b>]
<br>
<br> They desire to put out the light of Allah with their  mouths but Allah will perfect His light,
<br> though the  unbelievers may be averse.
<br>
<a name = "verse61_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.9</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the  true religion,
<br> that He may make it overcome the religions,
<br>  all of them,
<br> though the polytheists may be averse.
<br>
<a name = "verse61_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.10</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> shall I lead you to a merchandise  which may deliver you from a painful chastisement?
<br>
<a name = "verse61_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.11</b>]
<br>
<br> You shall believe in Allah and H,
<br>is Apostle,
<br> and  struggle hard in Allah's way with your property and your  lives;
<br> that is better for you,
<br> did you but know!
<br>
<a name = "verse61_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.12</b>]
<br>
<br> He will forgive you your faults and cause you to enter  into gardens,
<br> beneath which rivers flow,
<br> and goodly  dwellings in gardens of perpetuity;
<br> that is the mighty  achievement;
<br>
<a name = "verse61_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And yet another (blessing) that you love:
<br> help from  Allah and a victory near at hand;
<br> and give good news to the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse61_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>61.14</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> be helpers (in the cause) of Allah,
<br>  as Isa son of Marium said to (his) disciples:
<br> Who are my  helpers in the cause of Allah?
<br> The disciples said:
<br> We are  helpers (in the cause) of Allah.
<br> So a party of the children  of Israel believed and another party disbelieved;
<br> then We  aided those who believed against their enemy,
<br> and they  became uppermost.
