<p><h3>Book 80</h3>
<br><h3>He Frowned</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse80_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.1</b>]
<br>
<br> He frowned and turned (his) back,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Because there came to him the blind man.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And what would make you know that he would purify  himself,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Or become reminded so that the reminder should profit  him?
  <br>
<a name = "verse80_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  As for him who considers himself free from need (of you),
<br>
<a name = "verse80_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.6</b>]
<br>
<br> To him do you address yourself.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.7</b>]
<br>
 And no blame is on you if he would not purify himself<br>
<a name = "verse80_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And as to him who comes to you striving hard,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And he fears,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.10</b>]
<br>
<br> From him will you divert yourself.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> surely it is an admonishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.12</b>]
<br>
<br> So let him who pleases mind it.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.13</b>]
<br>
<br> In honored books,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Exalted,
<br> purified,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.15</b>]
<br>
 In the hands of scribes<br>
<a name = "verse80_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Noble,
<br> virtuous.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Cursed be man!
<br> how ungrateful is he!
<br>
<a name = "verse80_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Of what thing did He create him?
<br>
<a name = "verse80_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Of a small seed;
<br> He created him,
<br> then He made him  according to a measure,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.20</b>]
<br>
 Then (as for) the way-- He has made it easy (for him)<br>
<a name = "verse80_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Then He causes him to die,
<br> then assigns to him a grave,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Then when He pleases,
<br> He will raise him to life again.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay;
<br> but he has not done what He bade him.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Then let man look to his food,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.25</b>]
<br>
<br> That We pour down the water,
<br> pouring (it) down in  abundance,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We cleave the earth,
<br> cleaving (it) asunder,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We cause to grow therein the grain,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And grapes and clover,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And the olive and the palm,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And thick gardens,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.31</b>]
<br>
 And fruits and herbage<br>
<a name = "verse80_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.32</b>]
<br>
<br> A provision for you and for your cattle.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.33</b>]
<br>
<br> But when the deafening cry comes,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.34</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which a man shall fly from his brother,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And his mother and his father,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.36</b>]
<br>
 And his spouse and his son--<br>
<a name = "verse80_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Every man of them shall on that day have an affair which  will occupy him.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.38</b>]
<br>
<br> (Many) faces on that day shall be bright,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Laughing,
<br> joyous.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And (many) faces on that day,
<br> on them shall be dust,
<br>
<a name = "verse80_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Darkness shall cover them.
<br>
<a name = "verse80_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>80.42</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they who are unbelievers,
<br> the wicked.
