<p><h3>Book 6</h3>
<br><h3>The Cattle</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse6_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.1</b>]
<br>
<br> All praise is due to Allah,
<br> Who created the heavens and the  earth and made the darkness and the light;
<br> yet those who disbelieve  set up equals with their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.2</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who created you from clay,
<br> then He decreed a  term;
<br> and there is a term named with Him;
<br> still you doubt.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth;
<br> He knows  your secret (thoughts) and your open (words),
<br> and He knows  what you earn.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.4</b>]
<br>
 And there does not come to them any communication of  the communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it<br>
<a name = "verse6_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.5</b>]
<br>
<br> So they have indeed rejected the truth when it came to  them;
<br> therefore the truth of what they mocked at will shine upon  them.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not consider how many a generation We have  destroyed before them,
<br> whom We had established in the earth as  We have not established you,
<br> and We sent the clouds pouring  rain on them in abundance,
<br> and We made the rivers to flow  beneath them,
<br> then We destroyed them on account of their faults  and raised up after them another generation.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We had sent to you a writing on a paper,
<br> then they  had touched it with their hands,
<br> certainly those who disbelieve  would have said:
<br> This is nothing but clear enchantment.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Why has not an angel been sent down to  him?
<br> And had We sent down an angel,
<br> the matter would have  certainly been decided and then they would not have been  respited.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We had made him angel,
<br> We would certainly have  made him a man,
<br> and We would certainly have made confused  to them what they make confused.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly apostles before you were mocked at,
<br> but  that which they mocked at encompassed the scoffers among  them.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Travel in the land,
<br> then see what was the end of the  rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the  earth?
<br> Say:
<br> To Allah;
<br> He has ordained mercy on Himself;
<br> most  certainly He will gather you on the resurrection day-- there is no  doubt about it.
<br> (As for) those who have lost their souls,
<br> they will  not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Him belongs whatever dwells in the night and the  day;
<br> and He is the Hearing,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Shall I take a guardian besides Allah,
<br> the Originator  of the heavens and the earth,
<br> and He feeds (others) and is not  (Himself) fed.
<br> Say:
<br> I am commanded to be the first who submits  himself,
<br> and you should not be of the polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Surely I fear,
<br> if I disobey my Lord,
<br> the chastisement  of a grievous day.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.16</b>]
<br>
<br> He from whom it is averted on that day,
<br> Allah indeed has  shown mercy to him;
<br> and this is a manifest achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And if Allah touch you with affliction,
<br> there is none to  take it off but He;
<br> and if He visit you with good,
<br> then He has  power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And He is the Supreme,
<br> above His servants;
<br> and He is the  Wise,
<br> the Aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> What thing is the weightiest in testimony?
<br> Say:
<br> Allah  is witness between you and me;
<br> and this Quran has been revealed  to me that with it I may warn you and whomsoever it reaches.
<br>  Do you really bear witness that there are other gods with Allah?
<br>  Say:
<br> I do not bear witness.
<br> Say:
<br> He is only one God,
<br> and surely I  am clear of that which you set up (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse6_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Those whom We have given the Book recognize him as  they recognize their sons;
<br> (as for) those who have lost their souls,
<br>  they will not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against  Allah or (he who) gives the lie to His communications;
<br> surely the  unjust will not be successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when We shall gather them all together,
<br>  then shall We say to those who associated others (with Allah):
<br>  Where are your associates whom you asserted?
<br>
<a name = "verse6_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Then their excuse would be nothing but that they would  say:
<br> By Allah,
<br> our Lord,
<br> we were not polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.24</b>]
<br>
<br> See how they lie against their own souls,
<br> and that which  they forged has passed away from them.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And of them is he who hearkens to you,
<br> and We have cast  veils over their hearts lest they understand it and a heaviness into  their ears;
<br> and even if they see every sign they will not believe in  it;
<br> so much so that when they come to you they only dispute with  you;
<br> those who disbelieve say:
<br> This is naught but the stories of  the ancients.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And they prohibit (others) from it and go far away from  it,
<br> and they only bring destruction upon their own souls while  they do not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And could you see when they are made to stand before the  fire,
<br> then they shall say:
<br> Would that we were sent back,
<br> and we  would not reject the communications of our Lord and we would  be of the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> what they concealed before shall become manifest to  them;
<br> and if they were sent back,
<br> they would certainly go back to  that which they are forbidden,
<br> and most surely they are liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> There is nothing but our life of this world,
<br>  and we shall not be raised.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And could you see when they are made to stand before  their Lord.
<br> He will say:
<br> Is not this the truth?
<br> They will say:
<br> Yea!
<br>  by our Lord.
<br> He will say:
<br> Taste then the chastisement because  you disbelieved.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.31</b>]
<br>
<br> They are losers indeed who reject the meeting of Allah;
<br>  until when the hour comes upon them all of a sudden they shall  say:
<br> O our grief for our neglecting it!
<br> and they shall bear their  burdens on their backs;
<br> now surely evil is that which they bear.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And this world's life is naught but a play and an idle sport  and certainly the abode of the hereafter is better for those who  guard (against evil);
<br> do you not then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse6_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.33</b>]
<br>
<br> We know indeed that what they say certainly grieves you,
<br>  but surely they do not call you a liar;
<br> but the unjust deny the  communications of Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly apostles before you were rejected,
<br> but they  were patient on being rejected and persecuted until Our help  came to them;
<br> and there is none to change the words of Allah,
<br>  and certainly there has come to you some information about the  messengers.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And if their turning away is hard on you,
<br> then if you can  seek an opening (to go down) into the earth or a ladder (to  ascend up) to heaven so that you should bring them a sign and if  Allah had pleased He would certainly have gathered them all on  guidance,
<br> therefore be not of the ignorant.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Only those accept who listen;
<br> and (as to) the dead,
<br> Allah  will raise them,
<br> then to Him they shall be returned.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Why has not a sign been sent down to him  from his Lord?
<br> Say:
<br> Surely Allah is able to send down a sign,
<br> but  most of them do not know.
<br>    38 And there is no animal that walks upon the earth nor a  bird that flies with its two wings but (they are) genera like  yourselves;
<br> We have not neglected anything in the Book,
<br> then to  their Lord shall they be gathered.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And they who reject Our communications are deaf and  dumb,
<br> in utter darkness;
<br> whom Allah pleases He causes to err  and whom He pleases He puts on the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Tell me if the chastisement of Allah should overtake  you or the hour should come upon you,
<br> will you call (on others)  besides Allah,
<br> if you are truthful?
<br>
<a name = "verse6_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> Him you call upon,
<br> so He clears away that for which  you pray if He pleases and you forget what you set up (with  Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse6_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent (apostles) to nations before you  then We seized them with distress and affliction in order that  they might humble themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Yet why did they not,
<br> when Our punishment came to  them,
<br> humble themselves?
<br> But their hearts hardened and the  Shaitan made what they did fair-seeming to them.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.44</b>]
<br>
<br> But when they neglected that with which they had been  admonished,
<br> We opened for them the doors of all things,
<br> until  when they rejoiced in what they were given We seized them  suddenly;
<br> then lo!
<br> they were in utter despair.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.45</b>]
<br>
<br> So the roots of the people who were unjust were cut off;
<br>  and all praise is due to Allah,
<br> the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Have you considered that if Allah takes away your  hearing and your sight and sets a seal on your hearts,
<br> who is the  god besides Allah that can bring it to you?
<br> See how We repeat  the communications,
<br> yet they turn away.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Have you considered if the chastisement of Allah  should overtake you suddenly or openly,
<br> will any be destroyed  but the unjust people?
<br>
<a name = "verse6_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And We send not messengers but as announcers of good  news and givers of warning,
<br> then whoever believes and acts  aright,
<br> they shall have no fear,
<br> nor shall they grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who reject Our communications,
<br> chastisement  shall afflict them because they transgressed.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I do not say to you,
<br> I have with me the treasures of  Allah,
<br> nor do I know the unseen,
<br> nor do I say to you that I am  an angel;
<br> I do not follow aught save that which is revealed to me.
<br>  Say:
<br> Are the blind and the seeing one alike?
<br> Do you not then reflect?
<br>
<a name = "verse6_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And warn with it those who fear that they shall be gathered  to their Lord-- there is no guardian for them,
<br> nor any intercessor  besides Him-- that they may guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse6_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord in  the morning and the evening,
<br> they desire only His favor;
<br> neither  are you answerable for any reckoning of theirs,
<br> nor are they  answerable for any reckoning of yours,
<br> so that you should drive  them away and thus be of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus do We try some of them by others so that they  say:
<br> Are these they upon whom Allah has conferred benefit from  among us?
<br> Does not Allah best know the grateful?
<br>
<a name = "verse6_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And when those who believe in Our communications  come to you,
<br> say:
<br> Peace be on you,
<br> your Lord has ordained  mercy on Himself,
<br> (so) that if any one of you does evil in  ignorance,
<br> then turns after that and acts aright,
<br> then He is  Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus do We make distinct the communications and  so that the way of the guilty may become clear.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon  besides Allah.
<br> Say:
<br> I do not follow your low desires.
<br> for  then indeed I should have gone astray and I should not be of those  who go aright.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Surely I have manifest proof from my Lord and you  call it a lie;
<br> I have not with me that which you would hasten;
<br> the  t judgment is only Allah's;
<br> He relates the truth and He is the best  of deciders.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.58</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If that which you desire to hasten were with me,
<br> the  matter would have certainly been decided between you and me;
<br>  and Allah best knows the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And with Him are the keys of the unseen treasures-- none  knows them but He;
<br> and He knows what is in the land and the  sea,
<br> and there falls not a leaf but He knows it,
<br> nor a grain in the  darkness of the earth,
<br> nor anything green nor dry but (it is all) in  a clear book.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who takes your souls at night (in sleep),
<br> and  He knows what you acquire in the day,
<br> then He raises you up  therein that an appointed term may be fulfilled;
<br> then to Him is  your return,
<br> then He will inform you of what you were doing.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And He is the Supreme,
<br> above His servants,
<br> and He sends  keepers over you;
<br> until when death comes to one of you,
<br> Our  messengers cause him to die,
<br> and they are not remiss.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.62</b>]
<br>
<br> Then are they sent back to Allah,
<br> their Master,
<br> the True  one;
<br> now surely His is the judgment and He is swiftest in taking  account.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Who is it that delivers you from the dangers of the  land and the sea (when) you call upon Him (openly) humiliating  yourselves,
<br> and in secret:
<br> If He delivers us from this,
<br> we should  certainly be of the grateful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Allah delivers you from them and from every distress,
<br>  but again you set up others (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse6_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> He has the power that He should send on you a  chastisement from above you or from beneath your feet,
<br> or that  He should throw you into confusion,
<br> (making you) of different  parties;
<br> and make some of you taste the fighting of others.
<br> See  how We repeat the communications that they may  understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.66</b>]
<br>
<br> And your people call it a lie and it is the very truth.
<br> Say:
<br>  I am not placed in charge of you.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.67</b>]
<br>
<br> For every prophecy is a term,
<br> and you will come to know  (it).
<br>
<a name = "verse6_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you see those who enter into false discourses  about Our communications,
<br> withdraw from them until they  enter into some other discourse,
<br> and if the Shaitan causes you to  forget,
<br> then do not sit after recollection with the unjust  people.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And nought of the reckoning of their (deeds) shall be  against those who guard (against evil),
<br> but (theirs) is only to  remind,
<br> haply they may guard.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.70</b>]
<br>
<br> And leave those who have taken their religion for a play  and an idle sport,
<br> and whom this world's life has deceived,
<br> and  remind (them) thereby lest a soul should be given up to destruction  for what it has earned;
<br> it shall not have besides Allah any  guardian nor an intercessor,
<br> and if it should seek to give every  compensation,
<br> it shall not be accepted from it;
<br> these are they  who shall be given up to destruction for what they earned;
<br> they  shall have a drink of boiling water and a painful chastisement  because they disbelieved.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.71</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Shall we call on that besides Allah,
<br> which does not  benefit us nor harm us,
<br> and shall we be returned back on our  heels after Allah has guided us,
<br> like him whom the Shaitans have  made to fall down perplexed in the earth?
<br> He has companions  who call him to the right way,
<br> (saying):
<br> Come to us.
<br> Say:
<br> Surely  the guidance of Allah,
<br> that is the (true) guidance,
<br> and we are  commanded that we should submit to the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And that you should keep up prayer and be careful of  (your duty to) Him;
<br> and He it is to Whom you shall be gathered.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth  with truth,
<br> and on the day He says:
<br> Be,
<br> it is.
<br> His word is the  truth,
<br> and His is the kingdom on the day when the trumpet shall  be blown;
<br> the Knower of the unseen and the seen;
<br> and He is the  Wise,
<br> the Aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Ibrahim said to his sire,
<br> Azar:
<br> Do you take  idols for gods?
<br> Surely I see you and your people in manifest  error.
<br>

[<b>6.76</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the night over-shadowed him,

<br> said  he:
<br> Is this my Lord?
<br> So when it set,

<br> I do not love the  setting ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.77</b>]
<br>
<br> Then when he saw the moon rising,
<br> he said:
<br> Is this my  Lord?
<br> So when it set,
<br> he said:
<br> If my Lord had not guided me I  should certainly be of the erring people.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.78</b>]
<br>
<br> Then when he saw the sun rising,

<br>  Is this the greatest?
<br> So when it set,
<br> he said:
<br> O my people!
<br> surely I  am clear of what you set up (with Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse6_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.79</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I have turned myself,

<br> and I am not of the  polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And his people disputed with him.
<br> He said:
<br> Do you  dispute with me respecting Allah?
<br> And He has guided me indeed;
<br>  and I do not fear in any way those that you set up with Him,
<br>  unless my Lord pleases;
<br> my Lord comprehends all things in His  knowledge;
<br> will you not then mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse6_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.81</b>]
<br>
<br> And how should I fear what you have set up (with Him),
<br>  while you do not fear that you have set up with Allah that for  which He has not sent down to you any authority;
<br> which then of  the two parties is surer of security,
<br> if you know?
<br>
<a name = "verse6_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.82</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who believe and do not mix up their faith with  iniquity,

<a name = "verse6_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.83</b>]
<br>
<br> And this was Our argument which we gave to Ibrahim  against his people;

<br>
<a name = "verse6_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.84</b>]

<br> And We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub;
<br> each did We  guide,
<br> and Nuh did We guide before,
<br> and of his descendants,

<a name = "verse6_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.85</b>]
<br>
<br> And Zakariya and Yahya and Isa and Ilyas;

[<b>6.88</b>]
<br>
<br> This is Allah's guidance,

<br> And they do not assign to Allah the attributes due to Him  when they say:

[<b>6.99</b>]

[<b>6.108</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not abuse those whom they call upon besides  Allah,

<a name = "verse6_108"></a>

[<b>6.109</b>]
<br>
<br> And they swear by Allah with the strongest of their  oaths,

<br>
<a name = "verse6_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.110</b>]

<br>  but most of them are ignorant.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.112</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy,

<br> some of them suggesting to  others varnished falsehood to deceive (them),
<br> and had your Lord  pleased they would not have done it,

<p>
[<b>6.114</b>]
<br>
<br> Shall I then seek a judge other than Allah?

<br>
<a name = "verse6_114"></a>

[<b>6.115</b>]

<br>
<a name = "verse6_118"></a>

[<b>6.119</b>]
<br>
<br> And what reason have you that you should not eat of  that on which Allah's name has been mentioned,

<br>
<a name = "verse6_120"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.121</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not eat of that on which Allah's name has not  been mentioned,
<br> and that is most surely a transgression;
<br> and  most surely the Shaitans suggest to their friends that they should  contend with you;
<br> and if you obey them,
<br> you shall most surely be  polytheists.

<a name = "verse6_121"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.122</b>]
<br>
<br> Is he who was dead then We raised him to life and made  for him a light by which he walks among the people,

<br>
<a name = "verse6_122"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.123</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus have We made in every town the great ones to  be its guilty ones,

<br> and they do not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_123"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.124</b>]
<br>
<br> And when a communication comes to them they say:

<br> Allah best knows where He places His message.
<br> There  shall befall those who are guilty humiliation from Allah and  severe chastisement because of what they planned.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_124"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.125</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore (for) whomsoever Allah intends that He would  guide him aright,
<br> He expands his breast for Islam,
<br> and (for)  whomsoever He intends that He should cause him to err,
<br> He  makes his breast strait and narrow as though he were ascending  upwards;

<br>
<a name = "verse6_125"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.126</b>]
<br>
<br> And this is the path of your Lord,

<br> He shall say:
<br> The fire is  your abode,

<br>
<a name = "verse6_128"></a>

<a name = "verse6_129"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.130</b>]
<br>
<br> O assembly of jinn and men!

<br>
<a name = "verse6_130"></a>

<br> This is for Allah-- so they  assert-- and this for our associates;

<a name = "verse6_136"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.137</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus their associates have made fair seeming to most  of the polytheists the killing of their children,
<br> that they may  cause them to perish and obscure for them their religion;

<br> And to those who were Jews We made unlawful every  animal having claws,
<br> and of oxen and sheep We made unlawful  to them the fat of both,
<br> except such as was on their backs or the  entrails or what was mixed with bones:
<br> this was a punishment  We gave them on account of their rebellion,
<br> and We are surely  Truthful.

[<b>6.147</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they give you the lie,
<br> then say:
<br> Your Lord is the  Lord of All-encompassing mercy;
<br> and His punishment cannot be  averted from the guilty people.

<a name = "verse6_147"></a>

[<b>6.148</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who are polytheists will say:
<br> If Allah had pleased  we would not have associated (aught with Him) nor our fathers,
<br>  nor would we have forbidden (to ourselves) anything;
<br> even so  did those before them reject until they tasted Our punishment.
<br>  Say:
<br> Have you any knowledge with you so you should bring it  forth to us?
<br> You only follow a conjecture and you only tell lies.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_148"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.149</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Then Allah's is the conclusive argument;
<br> so if He  please,
<br> He would certainly guide you all.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_149"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.150</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Bring your witnesses who should bear witness that  Allah has forbidden this,
<br> then if they bear witness,
<br> do not bear  witness with them;
<br> and follow not the low desires of those who  reject Our communications and of those who do not believe in  the hereafter,
<br> and they make (others) equal to their  Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_150"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.151</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Come I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to  you-- (remember) that you do not associate anything with Him  and show kindness to your parents,
<br> and do not slay your children  for (fear of) poverty-- We provide for you and for them--  and do not draw nigh to indecencies,
<br> those of them which are  apparent and those which are concealed,
<br> and do not kill the soul  which Allah has forbidden except for the requirements of justice;
<br>  this He has enjoined you with that you may understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_151"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.152</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not approach the property of the orphan except  in the best manner until he attains his maturity,
<br> and give full  measure and weight with justice-- We do not impose on any soul  a duty except to the extent of its ability;
<br> and when you speak,
<br>  then be just though it be (against) a relative,
<br> and fulfill Allah's  covenant;
<br> this He has enjoined you with that you may be mindful;
<br>
<a name = "verse6_152"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.153</b>]
<br>
<br> And (know) that this is My path,
<br> the right one therefore  follow it,
<br> and follow not (other) ways,
<br> for they will lead you  away from His way;
<br> this He has enjoined you with that you may  guard (against evil).

<br> Again,
<br> We gave the Book to Musa to complete (Our  blessings) on him who would do good (to others),
<br> and making  plain all things and a guidance and a mercy,
<br> so that they should  believe in the meeting of their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_154"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.155</b>]
<br>
<br> And this is a Book We have revealed,
<br> blessed;
<br> therefore  follow it and guard (against evil) that mercy may be shown to  you.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_155"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.156</b>]
<br>
<br> Lest you say that the Book was only revealed to two  parties before us and We were truly unaware of what they read.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_156"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.157</b>]
<br>
<br> Or lest you should say:
<br> If the Book had been revealed  to us,
<br> we would certainly have been better guided than they,
<br> so  indeed there has come to you clear proof from your Lord,
<br> and  guidance and mercy.
<br> Who then is more unjust than he who  rejects Allah's communications and turns away from them?
<br> We  will reward those who turn away from Our communications  with an evil chastisement because they turned away.

<br> They do not wait aught but that the angels should come  to them,
<br> or that your Lord should come,
<br> or that some of the  signs of your Lord should come.
<br> On the day when some of the  signs of your Lord shall come,
<br> its faith shall not profit a soul  which did not believe before,
<br> or earn good through its faith.
<br> Say:
<br>  Wait;
<br> we too are waiting.

<br> Surely they who divided their religion into parts and  became sects,

<br> Whoever brings a good deed,

<br> Say:
<br> Surely,
<br> (as for) me,
<br> my Lord has guided me to the  right path;
<br> (to) a most right religion,
<br> the faith of Ibrahim the  upright one,
<br> and he was not of the polytheists.

<br> Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and  my death are (all) for Allah,

[<b>6.164</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> What!
<br> shall I seek a Lord other than Allah?
<br> And He  is the Lord of all things;
<br> and no soul earns (evil) but against  itself,
<br> and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another;
<br>  then to your Lord is your return,
<br> so He will inform you of that in  which you differed.
<br>
<a name = "verse6_164"></a>
<p>
[<b>6.165</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who has made you successors in the land  and raised some of you above others by (various) grades,
<br> that He  might try you by what He has given you;
<br> surely your Lord is  quick to requite (evil),
<br> and He is most surely the Forgiving,
<br> the  Merciful.
