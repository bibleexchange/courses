<p><h3>Book 89</h3>
<br><h3>The Daybreak</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse89_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.1</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the daybreak,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And the ten nights,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And the even and the odd,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And the night when it departs.
  <br>
<a name = "verse89_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Truly in that there is an oath for those who possess  understanding.
<br>
<a name = "verse89_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with Ad,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.7</b>]
<br>
<br> (The people of) Aram,
<br> possessors of lofty buildings,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.8</b>]
<br>
<br> The like of which were not created in the (other) cities;
<br>
<a name = "verse89_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And (with) Samood,
<br> who hewed out the rocks in the valley,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And (with) Firon,
<br> the lord of hosts,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Who committed inordinacy in the cities,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.12</b>]
<br>
<br> So they made great mischief therein?
<br>
<a name = "verse89_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore your Lord let down upon them a portion of the  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse89_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Most sure!
<br>y your Lord is watching.
<br>
<a name = "verse89_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for man,
<br> when his Lord tries him,
<br> then treats him  with honor and makes him lead an easy life,
<br> he says:
<br> My Lord  honors me.
<br>
<a name = "verse89_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.16</b>]
<br>
<br> But when He tries him (differently),
<br> then straitens to  him his means of subsistence,
<br> he says:
<br> My Lord has disgraced  me.
<br>
<a name = "verse89_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> but you do not honor the orphan,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor do you urge one another to feed the poor,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And you eat away the heritage,
<br> devouring (everything)  indiscriminately,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And you love wealth with exceeding love.
<br>
<a name = "verse89_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> when the earth is made to crumble to pieces,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord comes and (also) the angels in ranks,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And hell is made to appear on that day.
<br> On that day  shall man be mindful,
<br> and what shall being mindful (then)  avail him?
<br>
<a name = "verse89_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.24</b>]
<br>
<br> He shall say:
<br> O!
<br> would that I had sent before for (this)  my life!
<br>
<a name = "verse89_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.25</b>]
<br>
<br> But on that day shall no one chastise with (anything  like) His chastisement,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And no one shall bind with (anything like) His binding.
<br>
<a name = "verse89_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.27</b>]
<br>
<br> O soul that art at rest!
<br>
<a name = "verse89_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Return to your Lord,
<br> well-pleased (with him),
<br>  well-pleasing (Him),
<br>
<a name = "verse89_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.29</b>]
<br>
<br> So enter among My servants,
<br>
<a name = "verse89_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>89.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And enter into My garden.
