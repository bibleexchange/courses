<p><h3>Book 62</h3>
<br><h3>The Congregation</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse62_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth  declares the glory of Allah,
<br> the King,
<br> the Holy,
<br> the Mighty,
<br>  the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse62_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.2</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who raised among the inhabitants of Mecca an  Apostle from among themselves,
<br> who recites to them His  communications and purifies them,
<br> and teaches them the Book  and the Wisdom,
<br> although they were before certainly in clear  error,
<br>
<a name = "verse62_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And others from among them who have not yet joined them;
<br>  and He is the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse62_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.4</b>]
<br>
<br> That is Allah's grace;
<br> He grants it to whom He pleases,
<br>  and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.
<br>
<a name = "verse62_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.5</b>]
<br>
<br> The likeness of those who were charged with the Taurat,
<br>  then they did not observe it,
<br> is as the likeness of the ass  bearing books,
<br> evil is the likeness of the people who reject  the communications of Allah;
<br> and Allah does not guide the  unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse62_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O you who are Jews,
<br> if you think that you are the  favorites of Allah to the exclusion of other people,
<br> then  invoke death If you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse62_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And they will never invoke it because of what their hands  have sent before;
<br> and Allah is Cognizant of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse62_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> (As for) the death from which you flee,
<br> that will  surely overtake you,
<br> then you shall be sent back to the  Knower of the unseen and the seen,
<br> and He will inform you of  that which you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse62_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.9</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> when the call is made for prayer on  Friday,
<br> then hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave  off trading;
<br> that is better for you,
<br> if you know.
<br>
<a name = "verse62_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.10</b>]
<br>
<br> But when the prayer is ended,
<br> then disperse abroad in  the land and seek of Allah's grace,
<br> and remember Allah much,
<br>  that you may be successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse62_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>62.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they see merchandise or sport they break up for  It,
<br> and leave you standing.
<br> Say:
<br> What is with Allah is  better than sport and (better) than merchandise,
<br> and Allah  is the best of Sustainers.
