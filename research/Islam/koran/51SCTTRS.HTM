<p><h3>Book 51</h3>
<br><h3>The Scatterers</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse51_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.1</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the wind that scatters far and wide,
<br>
<a name = "verse51_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Then those clouds bearing the load (of minute things in  space).
<br>
<a name = "verse51_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Then those (ships) that glide easily,
<br>
<a name = "verse51_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Then those (angels who) distribute blessings by Our  command;
<br>
<a name = "verse51_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.5</b>]
<br>
<br> What you are threatened with is most surely true,
<br>
<a name = "verse51_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And the judgment must most surely come about.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.7</b>]
<br>
<br> 1 swear by the heaven full of ways.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely you are at variance with each other in what  you say,
<br>
<a name = "verse51_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.9</b>]
<br>
<br> He is turned away from it who would be turned away.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Cursed be the liars,
<br>
<a name = "verse51_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Who are in a gulf (of ignorance) neglectful;
<br>
<a name = "verse51_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.12</b>]
<br>
<br> They ask:
<br> When is the day of judgment?
<br>
<a name = "verse51_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.13</b>]
<br>
<br> (It is) the day on which they shall be tried at the  fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Taste your persecution!
<br> this is what.
<br>you would hasten  on.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in  gardens and fountains.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Taking what their Lord gives them;
<br> surely they were  before that,
<br> the doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.17</b>]
<br>
<br> They used to sleep but little in the night.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And in the morning they asked forgiveness.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And in their property was a portion due to him who begs  and to him who is denied (good).
<br>
<a name = "verse51_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And in the earth there are signs for those who are sure,
<br>
<a name = "verse51_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And in your own souls (too);
<br> will you not then see?
<br>
<a name = "verse51_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And in the heaven is your sustenance and what you are  threatened with.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth!
<br> it is most  surely the truth,
<br> just as you do speak.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Has there come to you information about the honored  guests of Ibrahim?
<br>
<a name = "verse51_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.25</b>]
<br>
<br> When they entered upon him,
<br> they said:
<br> Peace.
<br> Peace,
<br>  said he,
<br> a strange people.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he turned aside to his family secretly and brought  a fat (roasted) calf,
<br>
<a name = "verse51_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.27</b>]
<br>
<br> So he brought it near them.
<br> He said:
<br> What!
<br> will you not  eat?
<br>
<a name = "verse51_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.28</b>]
<br>
<br> So he conceived in his mind a fear on account of them.
<br>  They said:
<br> Fear not.
<br> And they gave him the good news of a  boy possessing knowledge.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Then his wife came up in great grief,
<br> and she struck her  face and said:
<br> An old barren woman!
<br>
<a name = "verse51_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.30</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Thus says your Lord:
<br> Surely He is the Wise,
<br>  the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.31</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> What is your affair then,
<br> O messengers!
<br>
<a name = "verse51_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.32</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Surely we are sent to a guilty people,
<br>
<a name = "verse51_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.33</b>]
<br>
<br> That we may send down upon them stone of clay,
<br>
<a name = "verse51_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Sent forth from your Lord for the extravagant.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We brought forth such as were therein of the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.36</b>]
<br>
<br> But We did not find therein save a (single) house of  those who submitted (the Muslims).
<br>
<a name = "verse51_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And We left therein a sign for those who fear the  painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And in Musa:
<br> When We sent him to Firon with clear  authority.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.39</b>]
<br>
<br> But he turned away with his forces and said:
<br> A magician  or a mad man.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.40</b>]
<br>
<br> So We seized him and his hosts and hurled them into the  sea and he was blamable.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And in Ad:
<br> When We sent upon them the destructive wind.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.42</b>]
<br>
<br> It did not leave aught on which it blew,
<br> but it made it  like ashes.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And in Samood:
<br> When it was said to them:
<br> Enjoy  yourselves for a while.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.44</b>]
<br>
<br> But they revolted against the commandment of their Lord,
<br>  so the rumbling overtook them while they saw.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.45</b>]
<br>
<br> So they were not able to rise up,
<br> nor could they defend  themselves-    46 And the people of Nuh before,
<br> surely they were a  transgressing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And the heaven,
<br> We raised it high with power,
<br> and most  surely We are the makers of things ample.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And the earth,
<br> We have made it a wide extent;
<br> how well  have We then spread (it) out.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And of everything We have created pairs that you may be  mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore fly to Allah,
<br> surely I am a plain warner to  you from Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not set up with Allah another god:
<br> surely I am a  plain warner to you from Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus there did not come to those before them an apostle  but they said:
<br> A magician or a mad man.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.53</b>]
<br>
<br> Have they charged each other with this?
<br> Nay!
<br> they are an  inordinate people.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Then turn your back upon them for you are not to blame;
<br>
<a name = "verse51_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And continue to remind,
<br> for surely the reminder profits  the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And I have not created the jinn and the men except that  they should serve Me.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.57</b>]
<br>
<br> 1 do not desire from them any sustenance and I do not  desire that they should feed Me.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.58</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah is the Bestower of sustenance,
<br> the Lord of  Power,
<br> the Strong.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.59</b>]
<br>
<br> So surely those who are unjust shall have a portion like  the portion of their companions,
<br> therefore let them not ask  Me to hasten on.
<br>
<a name = "verse51_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>51.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore woe to those who disbelieve because of their  day which they are threatened with.
