<p><h3>Book 30</h3>
<br><h3>The Romans</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse30_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.2</b>]
<br>
<br> The Romans are vanquished,
<br>
<a name = "verse30_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.3</b>]
<br>
<br> In a near land,
<br> and they,
<br> after being vanquished,
<br> shall  overcome,
<br>
<a name = "verse30_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Within a few years.
<br> Allah's is the command before and  after;
<br> and on that day the believers shall rejoice,
<br>
<a name = "verse30_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.5</b>]
<br>
<br> With the help of Allah;
<br> He helps whom He pleases;
<br> and He  is the Mighty,
<br> the Merciful;
<br>
<a name = "verse30_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.6</b>]
<br>
<br> (This is) Allah's promise!
<br> Allah will not fail His  promise,
<br> but most people do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.7</b>]
<br>
<br> They know the outward of this world's life,
<br> but of the  hereafter they are absolutely heedless.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not reflect within themselves:
<br> Allah did not  create the heavens and the earth and what is between them  two but with truth,
<br> and (for) an appointed term?
<br> And most  surely most of the people are deniers of the meeting of  their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the  end of those before them?
<br> They were stronger than these in  prowess,
<br> and dug up the earth,
<br> and built on it in greater  abundance than these have built on it,
<br> and there came to  them their apostles with clear arguments;
<br> so it was not  beseeming for Allah that He should deal with them unjustly,
<br>  but they dealt unjustly with their own souls.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Then evil was the end of those who did evil,
<br> because  they | rejected the communications of Allah and used to mock  them.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah originates the creation,
<br> then reproduces it,
<br> then  to Him you shall be brought back.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And at the time when the hour shall come the guilty  shall be in despair.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall not have any intercessors from among  their gods they have joined with God,
<br> and they shall be  deniers of their associate-gods.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And at the time when the hour shall come,
<br> at that time  they shall become separated one from the other.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Then as to those who believed and did good,
<br> they shall  be made happy in a garden.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And as to those who disbelieved and rejected Our  communications and the meeting of the hereafter,
<br> these shall  be brought over to the chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore glory be to Allah when you enter upon the time  of the evening and when you enter upon the time of the  morning.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Him belongs praise in the heavens and the earth,
<br>  and at nightfall and when you are at midday.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.19</b>]
<br>
<br> He brings forth the living from the dead and brings  forth the dead from the living,
<br> and gives life to the earth  after its death,
<br> and thus shall you be brought forth.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And one of His signs is that He created you from dust,
<br>  then lo!
<br> you are mortals (who) scatter.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And one of His signs is that He created mates for you  from yourselves that you may find rest in them,
<br> and He put  between you love and compassion;
<br> most surely there are signs  in this for a people who reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and  the earth and the diversity of your tongues and colors;
<br> most  surely there are signs in this for the learned.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And one of His signs is your sleeping and your seeking  of His grace by night and (by) day;
<br> most surely there are  signs in this for a people who would hear.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And one of His signs is that He shows you the lightning  for fear and for hope,
<br> and sends down water from the clouds  then gives life therewith to the earth after its death;
 most  surely there are signs in this for a people who understand<br>
<a name = "verse30_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And one of His signs is that the heaven and the earth  subsist by His command,
<br> then when He calls you with a  (single) call from out of the earth,
<br> lo!
<br> you come forth.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And His is whosoever is in the heavens and the earth;
<br>  all are obedient to Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who originates the creation,
<br> then  reproduces it,
<br> and it is easy to Him;
<br> and His are the most  exalted attributes in the heavens and the earth,
<br> and He is  the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.28</b>]
<br>
<br> He sets forth to you a parable relating to yourselves:
<br>  Have you among those whom your right hands possess partners  in what We have given you for sustenance,
<br> so that with  respect to it you are alike;
<br> you fear them as you fear each  other?
<br> Thus do We make the communications distinct for a  people who understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> those who are unjust follow their low desires  without any knowledge;
<br> so who can guide him whom Allah makes  err?
<br> And they shall have no helpers.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Then set your face upright for religion in the right  state-- the nature made by Allah in which He has made men;
<br>  there is no altering of Allah's creation;
<br> that is the right  religion,
 but most people do not know--<br>
<a name = "verse30_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Turning to Him,
 and be careful of (your duty to) Him and  keep up prayer and be not of the polytheists<br>
<a name = "verse30_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.32</b>]
<br>
 Of those who divided their religion and became seas  every sect rejoicing in what they had with them<br>
<a name = "verse30_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And when harm afflicts men,
<br> they call upon their Lord,
<br>  turning to Him,
<br> then when He makes them taste of mercy from  Him,
<br> lo!
<br> some of them begin to associate (others) with their  Lord,
<br>
<a name = "verse30_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.34</b>]
<br>
<br> So as to be ungrateful for what We have given them;
<br> but  enjoy yourselves (for a while),
<br> for you shall soon come to  know.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> have We sent down upon them an authority so that it  speaks of that which they associate with Him?
<br>
<a name = "verse30_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We make people taste of mercy they rejoice in  it,
<br> and if an evil befall them for what their hands have  already wrought,
<br> lo!
<br> they are in despair.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not see that Allah makes ample provision for  whom He pleases,
<br> or straitens?
<br> Most surely there are signs  in this for a people who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Then give to the near of kin his due,
<br> and to the needy  and the wayfarer;
<br> this is best for those who desire Allah's  pleasure,
<br> and these it is who are successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And whatever you lay out as usury,
<br> so that it may  increase in the property of men,
<br> it shall not increase with  Allah;
<br> and whatever you give in charity,
<br> desiring Allah's  pleasure-- it is these (persons) that shall get manifold.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is He Who created you,
<br> then gave you sustenance,
<br>  then He causes you to die,
<br> then brings you to life.
<br> Is there  any of your associate-gods who does aught of it?
<br> Glory be to  Him,
<br> and exalted be He above what they associate (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse30_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Corruption has appeared in the land and the sea on  account of what the hands of men have wrought,
<br> that He may  make them taste a part of that which they have done,
<br> so that  they may return.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Travel in the land,
<br> then see how was the end of  those before;
<br> most of them were polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Then turn thy face straight to the right religion before  there come from Allah the day which cannot be averted;
<br> on  that day they shall become separated.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever disbelieves,
<br> he shall be responsible for his  disbelief,
<br> and whoever does good,
<br> they prepare (good) for  their own souls,
<br>
<a name = "verse30_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.45</b>]
<br>
<br> That He may reward those who believe and do good out of  His grace;
<br> surely He does not love the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And one of His signs is that He sends forth the winds  bearing good news,
<br> and that He may make your taste of His  mercy,
<br> and that the ships may run by His command,
<br> and that  you may seek of His grace,
<br> and that you may be grateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent before you apostles to their  people,
<br> so they came to them with clear arguments,
<br> then We  gave the punishment to those who were guilty;
<br> and helping  the believers is ever incumbent on Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is he Who sends forth the winds so they raise a  cloud,
<br> then He spreads it forth in the sky as He pleases,
<br>  and He breaks it up so that you see the rain coming forth  from inside it;
<br> then when He causes it to fall upon whom He  pleases of His servants,
<br> lo!
 they are joyful<br>
<a name = "verse30_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Though they were before this,
<br> before it was sent down  upon them,
<br> confounded in sure despair.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Look then at the signs of Allah's mercy,
<br> how He gives  life to the earth after its death,
<br> most surely He will raise  the dead to life;
<br> and He has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We send a wind and they see it to be yellow,
 they  would after that certainly continue to disbelieve<br>
<a name = "verse30_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.52</b>]
<br>
<br> For surely you cannot,
<br> make the dead to hear and you  cannot make the deaf to hear the call,
 when they turn back  and<br>
<a name = "verse30_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.53</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor can you lead away the blind out of their error.
<br> You  cannot make to hear any but those who believe in Our  communications so they shall submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is He Who created you from a state of weakness  then He gave strength after weakness,
<br> then ordained weakness  and hoary hair after strength;
<br> He creates what He pleases,
<br>  and He is the Knowing,
<br> the Powerful.
  <br>
<a name = "verse30_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.55</b>]
<br>
<br>  And at the time when the hour shall come,
<br> the guilty  shall swear (that) they did not tarry but an hour;
<br> thus are  they ever turned away.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who are given knowledge and faith will say:
<br>  Certainly you tarried according to the ordinance of Allah  till the day of resurrection,
<br> so this is the day of  resurrection,
<br> but you did not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.57</b>]
<br>
<br> But on that day their excuse shall not profit those who  were unjust,
<br> nor shall they be regarded with goodwill.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have set forth for men every kind of  example in this Quran;
<br> and if you should bring them a  communication,
<br> those who disbelieve would certainly say:
<br> You  are naught but false claimants.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus does Allah set a seal on the hearts of those who do  not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse30_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>30.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore be patient;
<br> surely the promise of Allah is  true and let not those who have no certainty hold you in  light estimation.
