<p><h3>Book 57</h3>
<br><h3>The Iron</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse57_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares the  glory of Allah,
<br> and He is the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.2</b>]
<br>
<br> His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth;
<br> He gives  life and causes death;
<br> and He has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.3</b>]
<br>
<br> He is the First and the Last and the Ascendant (over all)  and the Knower of hidden things,
<br> and He is Cognizant of all  things.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.4</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is who created the heavens and the earth in six  periods,
<br> and He is firm in power;
<br> He knows that which goes  deep down into the earth and that which comes forth out of  it,
<br> and that which comes down from the heaven and that which  goes up into it,
<br> and He is with you wherever you are;
<br> and  Allah sees what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.5</b>]
<br>
<br> His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth;
<br> and to  Allah are (all) affairs returned.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.6</b>]
<br>
<br> He causes the night to enter in upon the day,
<br> and causes  the day to enter in upon the night,
<br> and He is Cognizant of  what is in the hearts.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Believe in Allah and His Apostle,
<br> and spend out of what  He has made you to be successors of;
<br> for those of you who  believe and spend shall have a great reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And what reason have you that you should not believe in  Allah?
<br> And the Apostle calls on you that you may believe in  your Lord,
<br> and indeed He has made a covenant with you if you  are believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.9</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is who sends down clear communications upon His  servant,
<br> that he may bring you forth from utter darkness  into light;
<br> and most surely Allah is Kind,
<br> Merciful to you.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And what reason have you that you should not spend in  Allah's way?
<br> And Allah's is the inheritance of the heavens  and the earth,
<br> not alike among you are those who spent  before the victory and fought (and those who did not):
<br> they  are more exalted in rank than those who spent and fought  afterwards;
<br> and Allah has promised good to all;
<br> and Allah is  Aware of what you do.
<br>    I 1.
<br> Who is there that will offer to Allah a good gift so He  will double it for him,
<br> and he shall have an excellent  reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.12</b>]
<br>
<br> On that day you will see the faithful men and the  faithful women-- their light running before them and on their  right hand-- good news for you today:
<br> gardens beneath which  rivers flow,
<br> to abide therein,
<br> that is the grand  achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.13</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when the hypocritical men and the  hypocritical women will say to those who believe:
<br> Wait for  us,
<br> that we may have light from your light;
<br> it shall be  said:
<br> Turn back and seek a light.
<br> Then separation would be  brought about between them,
<br> with a wall having a door in it;
<br>  (as for) the inside of it,
<br> there shall be mercy in it,
<br> and  (as for) the outside of it,
<br> before it there shall be  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.14</b>]
<br>
<br> They will cry out to them:
<br> Were we not with you?
<br> They  shall say:
<br> Yea!
<br> but you caused yourselves to fall into  temptation,
<br> and you waited and doubted,
<br> and vain desires  deceived you till  the threatened punishment of Allah came,
<br> while the  archdeceiver deceived you about Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.15</b>]
<br>
<br> So today ransom shall not be accepted from you nor from  those who disbelieved;
<br> your abode is the fire;
<br> it is your  friend and evil is the resort.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Has not the time yet come for those who believe that  their hearts should be humble for the remembrance of Allah  and what has come down of the truth?
<br> And that) they should  not be like those who were given the Book before,
<br> but the  time became prolonged to them,
<br> so their hearts hardened,
<br> and  most of them are transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death;
<br>  indeed,
<br> We have made the communications clear to you that  you may understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) the charitable men and the charitable  women and (those who) set apart for Allah a goodly portion,
<br>  it shall be doubled for them and they shall have a noble  reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who believe in Allah and His  apostles,
<br> these it is that are the truthful and the faithful  ones in the sight of their Lord:
<br> they shall have their  reward and their light,
<br> and (as for) those who disbelieve  and reject Our communications,
<br> these are the inmates of the  hell.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Know that this world's life is only sport and play and  gaiety and boasting among yourselves,
<br> and a vying in the  multiplication of wealth and children,
<br> like the rain,
<br> whose  causing the vegetation to grow,
<br> pleases the husbandmen,
<br> then  it withers away so that you will see it become yellow,
<br> then  it becomes dried up and broken down;
<br> and in the hereafter is  a severe chastisement and (also) forgiveness from Allah and  (His) pleasure;
<br> and this world's life is naught but means of  deception.
<br>    21 .
<br> Hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and to a garden  the extensiveness of which is as the extensiveness of the  heaven and the earth;
<br> it is prepared for those who believe  in Allah and His apostles;
<br> that is the grace of Allah:
<br> He  gives it to whom He pleases,
<br> and Allah is the Lord of mighty  grace.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.22</b>]
<br>
<br> No evil befalls on the earth nor in your own souls,
<br> but  it is in a book before We bring it into existence;
<br> surely  that is easy to Allah:
<br>
<a name = "verse57_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.23</b>]
<br>
<br> So that you may not grieve for what has escaped you,
<br> nor  be exultant at what He has given you;
<br> and Allah does not  love any arrogant boaster:
<br>
<a name = "verse57_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who are niggardly and enjoin niggardliness on men;
<br>  and whoever turns back,
<br> then surely Allah is He Who is the  Selfsufficient,
<br> the Praised.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly We sent Our apostles with clear arguments,
<br> and  sent down with them the Book and the balance that men may  conduct themselves with equity;
<br> and We have made the iron,
<br>  wherein is great violence and advantages to men,
<br> and that  Allah may know who helps Him and His apostles in the secret;
<br>  surely Allah is Strong,
<br> Mighty.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent Nuh and Ibrahim and We gave to  their offspring the (gift of) prophecy and the Book;
<br> so  there are among them those who go aright,
<br> and most of them  are transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We made Our apostles to follow in their footsteps,
<br>  and We sent Isa son of Marium afterwards,
<br> and We gave him  the Injeel,
<br> and We put in the hearts of those who followed  him kindness and mercy;
<br> and (as for) monkery,
<br> they innovated  it-- We did not prescribe it to them-- only to seek Allah's  pleasure,
<br> but they did not observe it with its due  observance;
<br> so We gave to those of them who believed their  reward,
<br> and most of them are transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse57_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.28</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> be careful of (your duty to) Allah  and believe in His Apostle:
<br> He will give you two portions of  His mercy,
<br> and make for you a light with which you will  walk,
<br> and forgive you,
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful;
<br>
<a name = "verse57_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>57.29</b>]
<br>
<br> So that the followers of the Book may know that they do  not control aught of the grace of Allah,
<br> and that grace 15 m  Allah's hand,
<br> He gives it to whom He pleases;
<br> and Allah is  the Lord of mighty grace.
