<p><h3>Book 16</h3>
<br><h3>The Bee</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse16_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah's commandment has come,
<br> therefore do not desire to  hasten it;
<br> glory be to Him,
<br> and highly exalted be He above  what they associate (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse16_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.2</b>]
<br>
<br> He sends down the angels with the inspiration by His  commandment on whom He pleases of His servants,
<br> saying:
<br> Give  the warning that there is no god but Me,
<br> therefore be  careful (of your duty) to Me.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.3</b>]
<br>
<br> He created the heavens and the earth with the truth,
<br>  highly exalted be He above what they associate (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse16_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.4</b>]
<br>
<br> He created man from a small seed and lo!
<br> he is an open  contender.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And He created the cattle for you;
<br> you have in them warm  clothing and (many) advantages,
<br> and of them do you eat.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And there is beauty in them for you when you drive them  back (to home),
<br> and when you send them forth (to pasture).
<br>
<a name = "verse16_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And they carry your heavy loads to regions which you  could not reach but with distress of the souls;
<br> most surely  your Lord is Compassionate,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And (He made) horses and mules and asses that you might  ride upon them and as an ornament;
<br> and He creates what you  do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And upon Allah it rests to show the right way,
<br> and there  are some deviating (ways);
<br> and if He please He would  certainly guide you all aright.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.10</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who sends down water from the cloud for you;
<br> it  gives drink,
<br> and by it (grow) the trees upon which you  pasture.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.11</b>]
<br>
<br> He causes to grow for you thereby herbage,
<br> and the  olives,
<br> and the palm trees,
<br> and the grapes,
<br> and of all the  fruits;
<br> most surely there is a sign in this for a people who  reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And He has made subservient for you the night and the  day and the sun and the moon,
<br> and the stars are made  subservient by His commandment;
<br> most surely there are signs  in this for a people who ponder;
<br>
<a name = "verse16_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And what He has created in the earth of varied hues most  surely there is a sign in this for a people who are mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who has made the sea subservient that you  may eat fresh flesh from it and bring forth from it  ornaments which you wear,
<br> and you see the ships cleaving  through it,
<br> and that you might seek of His bounty and that  you may give thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And He has cast great mountains in the earth lest it  might be convulsed with you,
<br> and rivers and roads that you  may go aright,
<br>
<a name = "verse16_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And landmarks;
<br> and by the stars they find the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Is He then Who creates like him who does not create?
<br> Do  you not then mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse16_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you would count Allah's favors,
<br> you will not be  able to number them;
<br> most surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah knows what you conceal and what you do openly.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And those whom they call on besides Allah have not  created anything while they are themselves created;
<br>
<a name = "verse16_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Dead (are they),
<br> not living,
<br> and they know not when they  shall be raised.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Your God is one God;
<br> so (as for) those who do not  believe m the hereafter,
<br> their hearts are ignorant and they  are proud.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Truly Allah knows what they hide and what they manifest;
<br>  surely He does not love the proud.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them,
<br> what is it that your Lord  has revealed?
<br> They say:
<br> Stories of the ancients;
<br>
<a name = "verse16_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.25</b>]
<br>
<br> That they may bear their burdens entirely on the day of  resurrection and also of the burdens of those whom they lead  astray without knowledge;
<br> now surely evil is what they bear.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Those before them did indeed devise plans,
<br> but Allah  demolished their building from the foundations,
<br> so the roof  fell down on them from above them,
<br> and the punishment came  to them from whence they did not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Then on the resurrection day He will bring them to  disgrace and say:
<br> Where are the associates you gave Me,
<br> for  whose sake you became hostile?
<br> Those who are given the  knowledge will say:
<br> Surely the disgrace and the evil are  this day upon the unbelievers:
<br>
<a name = "verse16_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Those whom the angels cause to die while they are unjust  to themselves.
<br> Then would they offer submission:
<br> We used not  to do any evil.
<br> Aye!
<br> surely Allah knows what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore enter the gates of hell,
<br> to abide therein;
<br> so  certainly evil is the dwelling place of the proud.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is said to those who guard (against evil):
<br> What  is it that your Lord has revealed?
<br> They say,
<br> Good.
<br> For those  who do good in this world is good,
<br> and certainly the abode  of the hereafter is better;
<br> and certainly most excellent is  the abode of those who guard (against evil);
<br>
<a name = "verse16_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.31</b>]
<br>
<br> The gardens of perpetuity,
<br> they shall enter them,
<br> rivers  flowing beneath them;
<br> they shall have in them what they  please.
<br> Thus does Allah reward those who guard (against  evil),
<br>
<a name = "verse16_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Those whom the angels cause to die in a good state,
<br>  saying:
<br> Peace be on you:
<br> enter the garden for what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.33</b>]
<br>
<br> They do not wait aught but that the angels should come  to them or that the commandment of your Lord should come to  pass.
<br> Thus did those before them;
<br> and Allah was not unjust  to them,
<br> but they were unjust to themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.34</b>]
<br>
<br> So the evil (consequences) of what they did shall  afflict them and that which they mocked shall encompass  them.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And they who give associates (to Allah) say:
<br> If Allah  had pleased,
<br> we would not have served anything besides  Allah,
<br> (neither) we nor our fathers,
<br> nor would we have  prohibited anything without (order from) Him.
<br> Thus did those  before them;
<br> is then aught incumbent upon the apostles  except a plain delivery (of the message)?
<br>
<a name = "verse16_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We raised in every nation an apostle  saying:
<br> Serve Allah and shun the Shaitan.
<br> So there were some  of them whom Allah guided and there were others against whom  error was due;
<br> therefore travel in the land,
<br> then see what  was the.
<br>end of the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.37</b>]
<br>
<br> If you desire for their guidance,
<br> yet surely Allah does  not guide him who leads astray,
<br> nor shall they have any  helpers.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And they swear by Allah with the most energetic of their  oaths:
<br> Allah will not raise up him who dies.
<br> Yea!
<br> it is a  promise binding on Him,
<br> quite true,
<br> but most people do not  know;
<br>
<a name = "verse16_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.39</b>]
<br>
<br> So that He might make manifest to them that about which  they differ,
<br> and that those who disbelieve might know that  they were liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Our word for a thing when We intend it,
<br> is only that We  say to it,
<br> Be,
<br> and it is.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who fly for Allah's sake after they are  oppressed,
<br> We will most certainly give them a good abode in  the world,
<br> and the reward of the hereafter is certainly much  greater,
<br> did they but know;
<br>
<a name = "verse16_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who are patient and on their Lord do they rely.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.43</b>]
<br>
 And We did not send before you any but men to whom We  sent revelation-- so ask the followers of the Reminder if you  do not know--<br>
<a name = "verse16_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.44</b>]
<br>
<br> With clear arguments and scriptures;
<br> and We have  revealed to you the Reminder that you may make clear to men  what has been revealed to them,
<br> and that haply they may  reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they then who plan evil (deeds) feel secure (of this)  that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them or that  punishment may not overtake them from whence they do not  perceive?
<br>
<a name = "verse16_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Or that He may not seize them in the course of their  journeys,
<br> then shall they not escape;
<br>
<a name = "verse16_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Or that He may not seize them by causing them to suffer  gradual loss,
<br> for your Lord is most surely Compassionate,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not consider every thing that Allah has created?
<br>  Its (very) shadows return from right and left,
<br> making  obeisance to Allah while they are in utter abasement.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And whatever creature that is in the heavens and that is  in the earth makes obeisance to Allah (only),
<br> and the angels  (too) and they do not show pride.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.50</b>]
<br>
<br> They fear their Lord above them and do what they are  commanded.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has said:
<br> Take not two gods,
<br> He is only one  God;
<br> so of Me alone should you be afraid.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His,
<br> and  to Him should obedience be (rendered) constantly;
<br> will you  then guard against other than (the punishment of) Allah?
<br>
<a name = "verse16_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And whatever favor is (bestowed) on you it is from  Allah;
<br> then when evil afflicts you,
<br> to Him do you cry for  aid.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Yet when He removes the evil from you,
<br> lo !
<br> a party of  you associate others with their Lord;
<br>
<a name = "verse16_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.55</b>]
<br>
<br> So that they be ungrateful for what We have given them;
<br>  then enjoy yourselves;
 for soon will you know<br>
<a name = "verse16_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And they set apart for what they do not know a portion  of what We have given them.
<br> By Allah,
<br> you shall most  certainly be questioned about that which you forged.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And they ascribe daughters to Allah,
<br> glory be to Him;
<br>  and for themselves (they would have) what they desire.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And when a daughter is announced to one of them his face  becomes black and he is full of wrath.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.59</b>]
<br>
<br> He hides himself from the people because of the evil of  that which is announced to him.
<br> Shall he keep it with  disgrace or bury it (alive) in the dust?
<br> Now surely evil is  what they judge.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.60</b>]
<br>
<br> For those who do not believe in the hereafter is an evil  attribute,
<br> and Allah's is the loftiest attribute;
<br> and He is  the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And if Allah had destroyed men for their iniquity,
<br> He  would not leave on the earth a single creature,
<br> but He  respites them till an appointed time;
<br> so when their doom  will come they shall not be able to delay (it) an hour nor  can they bring (it) on (before its time).
<br>
<a name = "verse16_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.62</b>]
<br>
<br> And they ascribe to Allah what they (themselves) hate  and their tongues relate the lie that they shall have the  good;
<br> there is no avoiding it that for them is the fire and  that they shall be sent before.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.63</b>]
<br>
<br> By Allah,
<br> most certainly We sent (apostles) to nations  before you,
<br> but the Shaitan made their deeds fair-seeming to  them,
<br> so he is their guardian today,
<br> and they shall have a  painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.64</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have not revealed to you the Book except that you  may make clear to them that about which they differ,
<br> ind  (as) a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has sent down water from the cloud and  therewith given life to the earth after its death;
<br> most  surely there is a sign in this for a people who would  listen.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.66</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle;
<br>  We give you to drink of what is in their bellies-- from  betwixt the feces and the blood-- pure milk,
<br> easy and  agreeable to swallow for those who drink.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And of the fruits of the palms and the grapes-- you obtain  from them intoxication and goodly provision;
<br> most surely  there is a sign in this for a people who ponder.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord revealed to the bee saying:
<br> Make hives in  the mountains and in the trees and in what they build:
<br>
<a name = "verse16_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Then eat of all the fruits and walk in the ways of your  Lord submissively.
<br> There comes forth from within it a  beverage of many colours,
<br> in which there is healing for men;
<br>  most surely there is a sign in this for a people who  reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.70</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has created you,
<br> then He causes you to die,
<br>  and of you is he who is brought back to the worst part of  life,
<br> so that after having knowledge he does not know  anything;
<br> surely Allah is Knowing,
<br> Powerful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has made some of you excel others in the means  of subsistence,
<br> so those who are made to excel do not give  away their sustenance to those whom their right hands  possess so that they should be equal therein;
<br> is it then the  favor of Allah which they deny?
<br>
<a name = "verse16_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has made wives for you from among yourselves,
<br>  and has given you sons and grandchildren from your wives,
<br>  and has given you of the good things;
<br> is it then in the  falsehood that they believe while it is in the favor of  Allah that they disbelieve?
<br>
<a name = "verse16_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And they serve besides Allah that which does not control  for them any sustenance at all from the heavens and the  earth,
<br> nor have they any power.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.74</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore do not give likenesses to Allah;
<br> surely Allah  knows and you do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.75</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah sets forth a parable:
<br> (consider) a slave,
<br> the  property of another,
<br> (who) has no power over anything,
<br> and  one whom We have granted from Ourselves a goodly sustenance  so he spends from it secretly and openly;
<br> are the two alike?
<br>  (All) praise is due to Allah!
<br> Nay,
<br> most of them do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.76</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah sets forth a parable of two men;
<br> one of them  is dumb,
<br> not able to do anything,
<br> and he is a burden to his  master;
<br> wherever he sends him,
<br> he brings no good;
<br> can he be  held equal with him who enjoins what is just,
<br> and he  (himself) is on the right path?
<br>
<a name = "verse16_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.77</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's is the unseen of the heavens and the earth;
<br>  and the matter of the hour is but as the twinkling of an eye  or it is higher still;
<br> surely Allah has power over all  things.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has brought you forth from the wombs of your  mothers-- you did not know anything-- and He gave you hearing  and sight and hearts that you may give thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.79</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not see the birds,
<br> constrained in the middle of  the sky?
<br> None withholds them but Allah;
<br> most surely there  are signs in this for a people who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has given you a place to abide in your houses,
<br>  and He has given you tents.
<br>of the skins of cattle which you  find light to carry on the day of your march and on the day  of your halting,
<br> and of their wool and their fur and their  hair (He has given you) household stuff and a provision for  a time.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.81</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has made for you of what He has created  shelters,
<br> and He has given you in the mountains places of  retreat,
<br> and He has given you garments to preserve you from  the heat and coats of mail to preserve you in your  fighting;
<br> even thus does He complete His favor upon you,
<br>  that haply you may submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.82</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they turn back,
<br> then on you devolves only the  clear deliverance (of the message).
<br>
<a name = "verse16_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.83</b>]
<br>
<br> They recognize the favor of Allah,
<br> yet they deny it,
<br> and  most of them are ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.84</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when We will raise up a witness out of  every nation,
<br> then shall no permission be given to those who  E disbelieve,
<br> nor shall they be made to solicit favor.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.85</b>]
<br>
<br> And when those who are unjust shall see the  chastisement,
<br> it shall not be lightened for them,
<br> nor shall  they be respited.
<br> .
<br>
<a name = "verse16_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.86</b>]
<br>
<br> And when those who associate (others with Allah) shall  see their associate-gods,
<br> they shall say:
<br> Our Lord,
<br> these  are our associate-gods on whom we called besides Thee.
<br> But  they will give them back the reply:
<br> Most surely you are  liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.87</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall tender submission to Allah on that day;
<br>  and what they used to forge shall depart from them.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.88</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah's  way,
<br> We will add chastisement to their chastisement because  they made mischief.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.89</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when We will raise up in every people a  witness against them from among themselves,
<br> and bring you as  a witness against these-- and We have revealed the Book to  you explaining clearly everything,
<br> and a guidance and mercy  and good news for those who submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.90</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah enjoins the doing of justice and the doing  of good (to others) and the giving to the kindred,
<br> and He  forbids indecency and evil and rebellion;
<br> He admonishes you  that you may be mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.91</b>]
<br>
<br> And fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have made a  covenant,
<br> and do not break the oaths after making them fast,
<br>  and you have indeed made Allah a surety for you;
<br> surely  Allah I .
<br> knows what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.92</b>]
<br>
<br> And be not like her who unravels her yarn,
<br>  disintegrating it into pieces after she has spun it  strongly.
<br> You make your oaths to be means of deceit between  you because (one) nation is more numerous than (another)  nation.
<br> Allah only tries you by this;
<br> and He will most  certainly make clear to you on the resurrection day that  about which you differed.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.93</b>]
<br>
<br> And if Allah please He would certainly make you a single  nation,
<br> but He causes to err whom He pleases and guides whom  He pleases;
<br> and most certainly you will be questioned as to  what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.94</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not make your oaths a means of deceit between  you,
<br> lest a foot should slip after its stability and you  should taste evil because you turned away from Allah's way  and grievous punishment be your (lot).
<br>
<a name = "verse16_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.95</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not take a small price in exchange for Allah's  covenant;
<br> surely what is with Allah is better for you,
<br> did  you but know.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.96</b>]
<br>
<br> What is with you passes away and what is with Allah is  enduring;
<br> and We will most certainly give to those who are  patient their reward for the best of what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.97</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever does good whether male or female and he is a  believer,
<br> We will most certainly make him live a happy life,
<br>  and We will most certainly give them their reward for the  best of what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.98</b>]
<br>
<br> So when you recite the Quran,
<br> seek refuge with Allah  from the accursed Shaitan,
<br>
<a name = "verse16_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.99</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely he has no authority over those who believe and  rely on their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.100</b>]
<br>
<br> His authority is only over those who befriend him and  those who associate others with Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.101</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We change (one) communication for (another)  communication,
<br> and Allah knows best what He reveals,
<br> they  say:
<br> You are only a forger.
<br> Nay,
<br> most of them do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.102</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> The Holy spirit has revealed it from your Lord  with the truth,
<br> that it may establish those who believe and  as a guidance and good news for those who submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.103</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We know that they say:
<br> Only a mortal  teaches him.
<br> The tongue of him whom they reproach is  barbarous,
<br> and this is clear Arabic tongue.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.104</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who do not believe in Allah's  communications,
<br> surely Allah will not guide them,
<br> and they  shall have a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.105</b>]
<br>
<br> Only they forge the lie who do not believe in Allah's  communications,
<br> and these are the liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.106</b>]
<br>
<br> He who disbelieves in Allah after his having believed,
<br>  not he who is compelled while his heart is at rest on  account of faith,
<br> but he who opens (his) breast to  disbelief-- on these is the wrath of Allah,
<br> and they shall  have a grievous chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.107</b>]
<br>
<br> This is because they love this world's life more than  the hereafter,
<br> and because Allah does not guide the  unbelieving people.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.108</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they on whose hearts and their hearing and  their eyes Allah has set a seal,
<br> and these are the heedless  ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.109</b>]
<br>
<br> No doubt that in the hereafter they will be the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.110</b>]
<br>
<br> Yet surely your Lord,
<br> with respect to those who fly  after they are persecuted,
<br> then they struggle hard and are  patient,
<br> most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.111</b>]
<br>
<br> (Remember) the day when every soul shall come,
<br> pleading  for itself and every soul shall be paid in full what it has  done,
<br> and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_112"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.112</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah sets forth a parable:
<br> (Consider) a town safe  and secure to which its means of subsistence come in  abundance from every quarter;
<br> but it became ungrateful to  Allah's favors,
<br> therefore Allah made it to taste the utmost  degree of hunger and fear because of what they wrought.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_113"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.113</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly there came to them an Apostle from among  them,
<br> but they rejected him,
<br> so the punishment overtook them  while they were unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_114"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.114</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore eat of what Allah has given you,
<br> lawful and  good (things),
<br> and give thanks for Allah's favor if Him do  you serve.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_115"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.115</b>]
<br>
<br> He has only forbidden you what dies of itself and blood  and flesh of swine and that over which any other name than  that of Allah has been invoked,
<br> but whoever is driven to  necessity,
<br> not desiring nor exceeding the limit,
<br> then surely  Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_116"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.116</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> for what your tongues describe,
<br> do not utter the  lie,
<br> (saying) This is lawful and this is unlawful,
<br> in order  to forge a lie against Allah;
<br> surely those who forge the lie  against Allah shall not prosper.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_117"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.117</b>]
<br>
<br> A little enjoyment and they shall have a painful  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_118"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.118</b>]
<br>
<br> And for those who were Jews We prohibited what We have  related to you already,
<br> and We did them no injustice,
<br> but  they were unjust to themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_119"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.119</b>]
<br>
<br> Yet surely your Lord,
<br> with respect to those who do an  evil in ignorance,
<br> then turn after that and make amends,
<br>  most surely your Lord after that is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_120"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.120</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Ibrahim was an exemplar,
<br> obedient to Allah,
<br>  upright,
<br> and he was not of the polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_121"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.121</b>]
<br>
<br> Grateful for His favors;
<br> He chose him and guided him on  the right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_122"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.122</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave him good in this world,
<br> and in the next he  will most surely be among the good.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_123"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.123</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We revealed to you:
<br> Follow the faith of Ibrahim,
<br>  the upright one,
<br> and he was not of the polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_124"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.124</b>]
<br>
<br> The Sabbath was ordained only for those who differed  about it,
<br> and most surely your Lord will judge between them  on the resurrection day concerning that about which they  differed.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_125"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.125</b>]
<br>
<br> Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly  exhortation,
<br> and have disputations with them in the best  manner;
<br> surely your Lord best knows those who go astray from  His path,
<br> and He knows best those who follow the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_126"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.126</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you take your turn,
<br> then retaliate with the like  of that with which you were afflicted;
<br> but if you are  patient,
<br> it will certainly be best for those who are  patient.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_127"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.127</b>]
<br>
<br> And be patient and your patience is not but by (the  assistance of) Allah,
<br> and grieve not for them,
<br> and do not  distress yourself at what they plan.
<br>
<a name = "verse16_128"></a>
<p>
[<b>16.128</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah is with those who guard (against evil) and  those who do good (to others).
