<p><h3>Book 9</h3>
<h3>The Immunity</h3>
<a name = "verse9_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.1</b>]
<br>
<br> (This is a declaration of) immunity by Allah and His  Apostle towards those of the idolaters with whom you made an  agreement.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.2</b>]
<br>
<br> So go about in the land for four months and know that you  cannot weaken Allah and that Allah will bring disgrace to the  unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And an announcement from Allah and His Apostle to the  people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah and His  Apostle are free from liability to the idolaters;
<br> therefore if you  repent,
<br> it will be better for you,
<br> and if you turn back,
<br> then know  that you will not weaken Allah;
<br> and announce painful punishment  to those who disbelieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Except those of the idolaters with whom you made an  agreement,
<br> then they have not failed you in anything and have  not backed up any one against you,
<br> so fulfill their agreement to  the end of their term;
<br> surely Allah loves those who are careful (of  their duty).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.5</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the sacred months have passed away,
<br> then slay the  idolaters wherever you find them,
<br> and take them captives and  besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush,
<br> then if  they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate,
<br> leave their  way free to them;
<br> surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And if one of the idolaters seek protection from you,
<br> grant  him protection till he hears the word of Allah,
<br> then make him  attain his place of safety;
<br> this is because they are a people who do  not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.7</b>]
<br>
<br> How can there be an agreement for the idolaters with Allah  and with His Apostle;
<br> except those with whom you made an  agreement at the Sacred Mosque?
<br> So as long as they are true to  you,
<br> be true to them;
<br> surely Allah loves those who are careful (of  their duty).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.8</b>]
<br>
<br> How (can it be)!
<br> while if they prevail against you,
<br> they  would not pay regard in your case to ties of relationship,
<br> nor  those of covenant;
<br> they please you with their mouths while their  hearts do not consent;
<br> and most of them are transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.9</b>]
<br>
<br> They have taken a small price for the communications of  Allah,
<br> so they turn away from His way;
<br> surely evil is it that they  do.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.10</b>]
<br>
<br> They do not pay regard to ties of relationship nor those of  covenant in the case of a believer;
<br> and these are they who go  beyond the limits.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.11</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate,
<br>  they are your brethren in faith;
<br> and We make the communications  clear for a people who know.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they break their oaths after their agreement and  (openly) revile your religion,
<br> then fight the leaders of unbelief--  surely their oaths are nothing-- so that they may desist.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.13</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> will you not fight a people who broke their oaths  and aimed at the expulsion of the Apostle,
<br> and they attacked  you first;
<br> do you fear them?
<br> But Allah is most deserving that you  should fear Him,
<br> if you are believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Fight them,
<br> Allah will punish them by your hands and  bring them to disgrace,
<br> and assist you against them and heal the  hearts of a believing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And remove the rage of their hearts;
<br> and Allah turns  (mercifully) to whom He pleases,
<br> and Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.16</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do you think that you will be left alone while Allah  has not yet known those of you who have struggled hard and  have not taken any one as an adherent besides Allah and His  Apostle and the believers;
<br> and Allah is aware of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.17</b>]
<br>
<br> The idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of Allah  while bearing witness to unbelief against themselves,
<br> these it is  whose doings are null,
<br> and in the fire shall they abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Only he shall visit the mosques of Allah who believes in  Allah and the latter day,
<br> and keeps up prayer and pays the poor-rate  and fears none but Allah;
<br> so (as for) these,
<br> it may be that  they are of the followers of the right course.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.19</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do you make (one who undertakes) the giving of  drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred Mosque like  him who believes in Allah and the latter day and strives hard in  Allah's way?
<br> They are not equal with Allah;
<br> and Allah does not  guide the unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who believed and fled (their homes),
<br> and strove  hard in Allah's way with their property and their souls,
<br> are much  higher in rank with Allah;
<br> and those are they who are the  achievers (of their objects).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Their Lord gives them good news of mercy from Himself  and (His) good pleasure and gardens,
<br> wherein lasting blessings  shall be theirs;
<br>
<a name = "verse9_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Abiding therein for ever;
<br> surely Allah has a Mighty reward  with Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.23</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not take your fathers and your  brothers for guardians if they love unbelief more than belief;
<br> and  whoever of you takes them for a guardian,
<br> these it is that are the  unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If your fathers and your sons and your brethren and  your mates and your kinsfolk and property which you have  acquired,
<br> and the slackness of trade which you fear and dwellings  which you like,
<br> are dearer to you than Allah and His Apostle  and striving in His way,
<br> then wait till Allah brings about His  command:
<br> and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly Allah helped you in many battlefields and on  the day of Hunain,
<br> when your great numbers made you vain,
<br> but  they availed you nothing and the earth became strait to you  notwithstanding its spaciousness,
<br> then you turned back retreating.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.26</b>]
<br>
<br>  Then Allah sent down His tranquillity upon His Apostle  and upon the believers,
<br> and sent down hosts which you did not  see,
<br> and chastised those who disbelieved,
<br> and that is the reward  of the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Then will Allah after this turn (mercifully) to whom He  pleases,
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.28</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> the idolaters are nothing but unclean,
<br>  so they shall not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year;
<br>  and if you fear poverty then Allah will enrich you out of His  grace if He please;
<br> surely Allah is Knowing Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Fight those who do not believe in Allah,
<br> nor in the latter  day,
<br> nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Apostle have  prohibited,
<br> nor follow the religion of truth,
<br> out of those who  have been given the Book,
<br> until they pay the tax in acknowledgment  of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And the Jews say:
<br> Uzair is the son of Allah;
<br> and the  Christians say:
<br> The Messiah is the son of Allah;
<br> these are the  words of their mouths;
<br> they imitate the saying of those who  disbelieved before;
<br> may Allah destroy them;
<br> how they are turned  away!
<br>
<a name = "verse9_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.31</b>]
<br>
<br> They have taken their doctors of law and their monks for    lords besides Allah,
<br> and (also) the Messiah son of Marium and  they were enjoined that they should serve one God only,
<br> there is  no god but He;
<br> far from His glory be what they set up (with  Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.32</b>]
<br>
<br> They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths,
<br>  and Allah will not consent save to perfect His light,
<br> though the  unbelievers are averse.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.33</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who sent His Apostle with guidance and the  religion of truth,
<br> that He might cause it to prevail over all  religions,
<br> though the polytheists may be averse.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.34</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> most surely many of the doctors of  law and the monks eat away the property of men falsely,
<br> and  turn (them) from Allah's way;
<br> and (as for) those who hoard up  gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah's way,
<br> announce to  them a painful chastisement,
<br>
<a name = "verse9_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.35</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when it shall be heated in the fire of hell,
<br> then  their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded  with it;
<br> this is what you hoarded up for yourselves,
<br> therefore  taste what you hoarded.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the number of months with Allah is twelve months  in Allah's ordinance since the day when He created the heavens  and the earth,
<br> of these four being sacred;
<br> that is the right  reckoning;
<br> therefore be not unjust to yourselves regarding them,
<br>  and fight the polytheists all together as they fight you all together;
<br>  and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Postponing (of the sacred month) is only an addition in  unbelief,
<br> wherewith those who disbelieve are led astray,
<br> violating  it one year and keeping it sacred another,
<br> that they may agree in  the number (of months) that Allah has made sacred,
<br> and thus  violate what Allah has made sacred;
<br> the evil of their doings is  made fairseeming to them;
<br> and Allah does not guide the unbelieving  people.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.38</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> What (excuse) have you that when it is  said to you:
<br> Go forth in Allah's way,
<br> you should incline heavily  to earth;
<br> are you contented with this world's life instead of the  hereafter?
<br> But the provision of this world's life compared with  the hereafter is but little.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.39</b>]
<br>
<br> If you do not go forth,
<br> He will chastise you with a painful  chastisement and bring in your place a people other than you,
<br>  and you will do Him no harm;
<br> and Allah has power over all  things.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.40</b>]
<br>
<br> If you will not aid him,
<br> Allah certainly aided him when  those who disbelieved expelled him,
<br> he being the second of the  two,
<br> when they were both in the cave,
<br> when he said to his  companion:
<br> Grieve not,
<br> surely Allah is with us.
<br> So Allah sent  down His tranquillity upon him and strengthened him with hosts  which you did not see,
<br> and made lowest the word of those who  disbelieved;
<br> and the word of Allah,
<br> that is the highest;
<br> and Allah  is Mighty,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Go forth light and heavy,
<br> and strive hard in Allah's way  with your property and your persons;
<br> this is better for you,
<br> if  you know.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Had it been a near advantage and a short journey,
<br> they  would certainly have followed you,
<br> but the tedious journey was  too long for them;
<br> and they swear by Allah:
<br> If we had been able,
<br>  we would certainly have gone forth with you;
<br> they cause their  own souls to perish,
 and Allah knows that they are most surely<br>
<a name = "verse9_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah pardon you!
<br> Why did you give them leave until  those who spoke the truth had become manifest to you and you  had known the liars?
<br>
<a name = "verse9_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.44</b>]
<br>
<br> They do not ask leave of you who believe in Allah and the  latter day (to stay away) from striving hard with their property  and their persons,
<br> and Allah knows those who guard (against  evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.45</b>]
<br>
<br> They only ask leave of you who do not believe in Allah  and the latter day and their hearts are in doubt,
<br> so in their doubt  do they waver.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they had intended to go forth,
<br> they would certainly  have provided equipment for it,
<br> but Allah did not like their  going forth,
<br> so He withheld them,
<br> and it was said (to them):
<br>  Hold back with those who hold back.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Had they gone forth with you,
<br> they would not have added  to you aught save corruption,
<br> and they would certainly have  hurried about among you seeking (to sow) dissension among  you,
<br> and among you there are those who hearken for their sake;
<br>  and Allah knows the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly they sought (to sow) dissension before,
<br> and they  meditated plots against you until the truth came,
<br> and Allah's  commandment prevailed although they were averse (from it).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And among them there is he who says:
<br> Allow me and do  not try me.
<br> Surely into trial have they already tumbled down,
<br>  and most surely hell encompasses the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.50</b>]
<br>
<br> If good befalls you,
<br> it grieves them,
<br> and if hardship afflicts  you,
<br> they say:
<br> Indeed we had taken care of our affair before;
<br> and  they turn back and are glad.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.51</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Nothing will afflict us save what Allah has ordained  for us;
<br> He is our.
<br>Patron;
<br> and on Allah let the believers rely.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Do you await for us but one of two most excellent  things?
<br> And we await for you that Allah will afflict you with  punishment from Himself or by our hands.
<br> So wait;
<br> we too will  wait with you.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.53</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Spend willingly or unwillingly,
<br> it shall not be accepted  from you;
<br> surely you are a transgressing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And nothing hinders their spendings being accepted from  them,
<br> except that they disbelieve in Allah and in His Apostle and  they do not come to prayer but while they are sluggish,
<br> and they  do not spend but while they are unwilling.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Let not then their property and their children excite your  admiration;
<br> Allah only wishes to chastise them with these in this  world's life and (that) their souls may depart while they are  unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And they swear by Allah that they are most surely of you,
<br>  and they are not of you,
<br> but they are a people who are afraid (of  you).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.57</b>]
<br>
<br> If they could find a refuge or cave or a place to enter into,
<br>  they would certainly have turned thereto,
<br> running away in all  haste.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And of them there are those who blame you with respect  to the alms;
<br> so if they are given from it they are pleased,
<br> and if  they are not given from it,
<br> lo!
<br> they are full of rage.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they were content with what Allah and His Apostle  gave them,
<br> and had said:
<br> Allah is sufficient for us;
<br> Allah will  soon give us (more) out of His grace and His Apostle too;
<br> surely  to Allah do we make our petition.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Alms are only for the poor and the needy,
<br> and the officials  (appointed) over them,
<br> and those whose hearts are made to  incline (to truth) and the (ransoming of) captives and those in  debts and in the way of Allah and the wayfarer;
<br> an ordinance  from Allah;
<br> and Allah is knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And there are some of them who molest the Prophet and  say:
<br> He is one who believes every thing that he hears;
<br> say:
<br> A  hearer of good for you (who) believes in Allah and believes the  faithful and a mercy for those of you who believe;
<br> and (as for)  those who molest the Apostle of Allah,
<br> they shall have a painful  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.62</b>]
<br>
<br> They swear to you by Allah that they might please you  and,
<br> Allah,
<br> as well as His Apostle,
<br> has a greater right that they  should please Him,
<br> if they are believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not know that whoever acts in opposition to  Allah and His Apostle,
<br> he shall surely have the fire of hell to  abide in it?
<br> That is the grievous abasement.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.64</b>]
<br>
<br> The hypocrites fear lest a chapter should be sent down to  them telling them plainly of what is in their hearts.
<br> Say:
<br> Go on  mocking,
<br> surely Allah will bring forth what you fear.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you should question them,
<br> they would certainly  say:
<br> We were only idly discoursing and sporting.
<br> Say:
<br> Was it at  Allah and His communications and His Apostle that you mocked?
<br>
<a name = "verse9_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Do not make excuses;
<br> you have denied indeed after you  had believed;
<br> if We pardon a party of you,
<br> We will chastise  (another) party because they are guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.67</b>]
<br>
<br> The hypocritical men and the hypocritical women are all  alike;
<br> they enjoin evil and forbid good and withhold their hands;
<br>  they have forsaken Allah,
<br> so He has forsaken them;
<br> surely the  hypocrites are the transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.68</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has promised the hypocritical men and the hypocritical  women and the unbelievers the fire of hell to abide  therein;
<br> it is enough for them;
<br> and Allah has cursed them and  they shall have lasting punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Like those before you;
<br> they were stronger than you in  power and more abundant in wealth and children,
<br> so they enjoyed  their portion;
<br> thus have you enjoyed your portion as those  before you enjoyed their portion;
<br> and you entered into vain  discourses like the vain discourses in which entered those before  you.
<br> These are they whose works are null in this world and the  hereafter,
<br> and these are they who are the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.70</b>]
<br>
<br> Has not the news of those before them come to them;
<br> of  the people of Nuh and Ad and Samood,
<br> and the people of  Ibrahim and the dwellers of Madyan and the overthrown cities;
<br>  their apostles came to them with clear arguments;
<br> so it was not  Allah Who should do them injustice,
<br> but they were unjust to  themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) the believing men and the believing women,
<br>  they are guardians of each other;
<br> they enjoin good and forbid  evil and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate,
<br> and obey Allah  and His Apostle;
<br> (as for) these,
<br> Allah will show mercy to them;
<br>  surely Allah is Mighty,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.72</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing  women gardens,
<br> beneath which rivers flow,
<br> to abide in them,
<br>  and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode;
<br> and best of  all is Allah's goodly pleasure;
<br> that is the grand achievement.

<a name = "verse9_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.73</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> strive hard against the unbelievers and the  hypocrites and be unyielding to them;

<p>
[<b>9.74</b>]
<br>
<br> They swear by Allah that they did not speak,
<br> and certainly  they did speak,
<br> the word of unbelief,
<br> and disbelieved after their  Islam,
<br> and they had determined upon what they have not been  able to effect,
<br> and they did not find fault except because Allah  and His Apostle enriched them out of His grace;
<br> therefore if they  repent,
<br> it will be good for them;
<br> and if they turn back,
<br> Allah will  chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world and the  hereafter,
<br> and they shall not have in the land any guardian or a  helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.75</b>]
<br>
<br> And there are those of them who made a covenant with  Allah:
<br> If He give us out of His grace,
<br> we will certainly give alms  and we will certainly be of the good.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.76</b>]
<br>
<br> But when He gave them out of His grace,
<br> they became  niggardly of it and they turned back and they withdrew.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.77</b>]
<br>
<br> So He made hypocrisy to follow as a consequence into  their hearts till the day when they shall meet Him because they  failed to perform towards Allah what they had promised with  Him and because they told lies.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.78</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not know that Allah knows their hidden thoughts  and their secret counsels,
<br> and that Allah is the great Knower of  the unseen things?
<br>
<a name = "verse9_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.79</b>]
<br>
<br> They who taunt those of the faithful who give their alms  freely,
<br> and those who give to the extent of their earnings and  scoff at them;
<br> Allah will pay them back their scoffing,
<br> and they  shall have a painful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.80</b>]
<br>
<br> Ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for  them;
<br> even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times,
<br> Allah  will not forgive them;
<br> this is because they disbelieve in Allah and  His Apostle,
<br> and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who were left behind were glad on account of their  sitting behind Allah's Apostle and they were averse from striving  m Allah's way with their property and their persons,
<br> and said:
<br>  Do not go forth in the heat.
<br> Say:
<br> The fire of hell is much severe  in heat.
<br> Would that they understood (it).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.82</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore they shall laugh little and weep much as a  recompense for what they earned.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.83</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore if Allah brings you back to a party of them  and then they ask your permission to go forth,
<br> say:
<br> By no means  shall you ever go forth with me and by no means shall you fight  an enemy with me;
<br> surely you chose to sit the first time,
<br> therefore  sit (now) with those who remain behind.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.84</b>]
<br>
<br> And never offer prayer for any one of them who dies and  do not stand by his grave;
<br> surely they disbelieve in Allah and His  Apostle and they shall die in transgression.
<br>    85 And let not their property and their children excite your  admlration;
 Allah only wishes to chastise them with these in this  world and (that) their souls may depart while they are  unbelievers<br>
<a name = "verse9_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.86</b>]
<br>
<br> And whenever a chapter is revealed,
<br> saying:
<br> Believe in  Allah and strive hard along with His Apostle,
<br> those having  ampleness of means ask permission of you and say:
<br> Leave us  (behind),
<br> that we may be with those who sit.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.87</b>]
<br>
<br> They preferred to be with those who remained behind,

<br>
<a name = "verse9_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.88</b>]
<br>
<br> But the Apostle and those who believe with him strive  hard with their property and their persons;

<p>
[<b>9.89</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers  flow,
<br> to abide in them;
<br> that is the great achievement.
<br>  And the defaulters from among the dwellers of the desert  came that permission may be given to them and they sat (at  home) who lied to Allah and His Apostle;
<br> a painful chastisement  shall afflict those of them who disbelieved.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.91</b>]
<br>
<br> It shall be no crime in the weak,
<br> nor in the sick,
<br> nor in  those who do not find what they should spend (to stay behind),
<br>  so long as they are sincere to Allah and His Apostle;
<br> there is no  way (to blame) against the doers of good;
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful;
<br>
<a name = "verse9_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.92</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor in those who when they came to you that you might  carry them,
<br> you said:
<br> I cannot find that on which to carry you;
<br>  they went back while their eyes overflowed with tears on account  of grief for not finding that which they should spend.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.93</b>]
<br>
<br> The way (to blame) is only against those who ask permission  of you though they are rich;
<br> they have chosen to be with  those who remained behind,
<br> and Allah has set a seal upon their  hearts so they do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.94</b>]
<br>
<br> They will excuse themselves to you when you go back to  them.
<br> Say:
<br> Urge no excuse,
<br> by no means will we believe you;
<br>  indeed Allah has informed us of matters relating to you;
<br> and  now Allah and His Apostle will see your doings,
<br> then you shall  be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen,
<br> then  He will inform you of what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.95</b>]
<br>
<br> They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them  so that you may turn aside from them;
<br> so do turn aside from  them;
<br> surely they are unclean and their abode is hell;
<br> a recompense  for what they earned.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.96</b>]
<br>
<br> They will swear to you that you may be pleased with  them;
<br> but if you are pleased with them,
<br> yet surely Allah is not  pleased with the transgressing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.97</b>]
<br>
<br> The dwellers of the desert are very hard in unbelief and  hypocrisy,
<br> and more disposed not to know the limits of what  Allah has revealed to His Apostle;
<br> and Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.98</b>]
<br>
<br> And of the dwellers of the desert are those who take what  they spend to be a fine,
<br> and they wait (the befalling of) calamities  to you;
<br> on them (will be) the evil calamity;
<br> and Allah is Hearing,

<br>
<a name = "verse9_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.99</b>]
<br>
<br> And of the dwellers of the desert are those who believe in  Allah and the latter day and take what they spend to be (means  of) the nearness of Allah and the Apostle's prayers;
<br> surely it shall  be means of nearness for them;
<br> Allah will make them enter into  His mercy;
<br> surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.100</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) the foremost,
<br> the first of the Muhajirs and  the Ansars,
<br> and those who followed them in goodness,
<br> Allah is  well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him,
<br> and  He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flOw,

<br> that is the mighty achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.101</b>]
<br>
<br> And from among those who are round about you of the  dwellers of the desert there are hypocrites,
<br> and from among the  people of Medina (also);
<br> they are stubborn in hypocrisy;
<br> you do  not know them;
<br> We know them;
 We will chastise them twice  then shall they be turned back to a grievous chastisement<br>
<a name = "verse9_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.102</b>]
<br>
<br> And others have confessed their faults,
<br> they have mingled  a good deed and an evil one;
<br> may be Allah will turn to them  (mercifully);
<br> surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.103</b>]
<br>
<br> Take alms out of their property,
<br> you would cleanse them  and purify them thereby,
<br> and pray for them;
<br> surely your prayer  is a relief to them;
<br> and Allah is Hearing,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.104</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not know that Allah accepts repentance from  His servants and takes the alms,
<br> and that Allah is the Oft-returning  (to mercy),
<br> the Merciful?
<br>
<a name = "verse9_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.105</b>]
<br>
<br> And say:
<br> Work;
<br> so Allah will see your work and (so will)  His Apostle and the believers;
<br> and you shall be brought back to  the Knower of the unseen and the seen,
<br> then He will inform you  of what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.106</b>]
<br>
<br> And others are made to await Allah's command,
<br> whether  He chastise them or whether He turn to them (mercifully),
<br> and  Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>    107 And those who built a masjid to cause harm and for  unbelief and to cause disunion among the believers and an  ambush to him who made war against Allah and His Apostle  before;
<br> and they will certainly swear:
<br> We did not desire aught  but good;
<br> and Allah bears witness that they are most surely  liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.108</b>]
<br>
<br> Never stand in it;
<br> certainly a masjid founded on piety  from the very first day is more deserving that you should stand  in it;
<br> in it are men who love that they should be purified;
<br> and  Allah loves those who purify themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.109</b>]
<br>
<br> Is he,

<br> or he who lays his foundation on  the edge of a cracking hollowed bank,

[<b>9.110</b>]
<br>
<br> The building which they have built will ever continue to  be a source of disquiet in their hearts,

<br> and Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.111</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah has bought of the believers their persons  and their property for this,
<br> that they shall have the garden;
<br> they  fight in Allah's way,
<br> so they slay and are slain;
<br> a promise which  is binding on Him in the Taurat and the Injeel and the Quran;
<br>  and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah?
<br> Rejoice  therefore in the pledge which you have made;
<br> and that is the  mighty achievement.

<br> who fast,
<br> who bow down,
<br> who prostrate themselves,
<br> who  enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil,
<br> and who keep the  limits of Allah;

<br>
<a name = "verse9_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.113</b>]
<br>
<br> It is not (fit) for the Prophet and those who believe that  they should ask forgiveness for the polytheists,
<br> even though they  should be near relatives,
<br> after it has become clear to them that  they are inmates of the flaming fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.114</b>]
<br>
<br> And Ibrahim asking forgiveness for his sire was only  owing to a promise which he had made to him;
<br> but when it  became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah,
<br> he declared  himself to be clear of him;
<br> most surely Ibrahim was very tender-hearted  forbearing.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_112"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.115</b>]
<br>
<br> It is not (attributable to) Allah that He should lead a  people astray after He has guided them;
<br> He even makes clear to  them what they should guard against;
<br> surely Allah knows all  things.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_113"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.116</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the  earth;
<br> He brings to life and causes to die;
<br> and there is not for you  besides Allah any Guardian or Helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_114"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.117</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly Allah has turned (mercifully) to the Prophet  and those who fled (their homes) and the helpers who followed  him in the hour of straitness after the hearts of a part of them  were about to deviate,
<br> then He turned to them (mercifully);
<br>  surely to them He is Compassionate,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_115"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.118</b>]
<br>
<br> And to the three who were left behind,
<br> until the earth  became strait to them notwithstanding its spaciousness and their  souls were also straitened to them;
<br> and they knew it for certain  that there was no refuge from Allah but in Him;
<br> then He turned  to them (mercifully) that they might turn (to Him);
<br> surely Allah  is the Oft-returning (to mercy),
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_116"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.119</b>]

<a name = "verse9_117"></a>

[<b>9.120</b>]
<br>
<br> It did not beseem the people of Medina and those round  about them of the dwellers of the desert to remain behind the  Apostle of Allah,
<br> nor should they desire (anything) for themselves  in preference to him;
<br> this is because there afflicts them not  thirst or fatigue or hunger in Allah's way,
<br> nor do they tread a  path which enrages the unbelievers,
<br> nor do they attain from the  enemy what they attain,
<br> but a good work is written down to  them on account of it;
<br> surely Allah does not waste the reward of  the doers of good;
<br>
<a name = "verse9_118"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.121</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor do they spend anything that may be spent,
<br> small or  great,
<br> nor do they traverse a valley,
<br> but it is written down to their  credit,
<br> that Allah may reward them with the best of what they  have done.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_119"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.122</b>]
<br>
<br> And it does not beseem the believers that they should go  forth all together;
<br> why should not then a company from every  party from among them go forth that they may apply themselves  to obtain understanding in religion,
<br> and that they may warn  their people when they come back to them that they may be  cautious?
<br>
<a name = "verse9_120"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.123</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> fight those of the unbelievers who are  near to you and let them find in you hardness;
<br> and know that  Allah is with those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse9_121"></a>

[<b>9.124</b>]
<br>
<br> And whenever a chapter is revealed,
<br> there are some of  them who say:
<br> Which of you has it strengthened in faith?
<br> Then  as for those who believe,
<br> it strengthens them in faith and they  rejoice.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_122"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.125</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for those in whose hearts is a disease,
<br> it adds  uncleanness to their uncleanness and they die while they are  unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_123"></a>

[<b>9.126</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not see that they are tried once or twice in every  year,

<br>
<a name = "verse9_124"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.127</b>]
<br>
<br> And whenever a chapter is revealed,
<br> they cast glances at  one another:
<br> Does any one see you?
<br> Then they turn away:
<br> Allah  has turned away their hearts because they are a people who do  not understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse9_125"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.128</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly an Apostle has come to you from among yourselves;
<br>  grievous to him is your falling into distress,
<br> excessively  solicitous respecting you;
<br> to the believers (he is)  compassionate,
<br>
<a name = "verse9_126"></a>
<p>
[<b>9.129</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they turn back,
