<p><h3>Book 49</h3>
<br><h3>The Chambers</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse49_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> be not forward in the presence of  Allah and His Apostle,
<br> and be careful of (your duty to)  Allah;
<br> surely Allah is Hearing,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.2</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not raise your voices above the  voice of the Prophet,
<br> and do not speak loud to him as you  speak loud to one another,
<br> lest your deeds became null while  you do not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who lower their voices before Allah's  Apostle are they whose hearts Allah has proved for guarding  (against evil);
<br> they shall have forgiveness and a great  reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.4</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who call out to you from behind the  private chambers,
<br> surely most of them do not understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they wait patiently until you come out to them,
<br> it  would certainly be better for them,
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.6</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> if an evil-doer comes to you with a  report,
<br> look carefully into it,
<br> lest you harm a people in  ignorance,
<br> then be sorry for what you have done.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And know that among you is Allah's Apostle;
<br> should he  obey you in many a matter,
<br> you would surely fall into  distress,
<br> but Allah has endeared the faith to you and has  made it seemly in your hearts,
<br> and He has made hateful to  you unbelief and transgression and disobedience;
<br> these it is  that are the followers of a right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.8</b>]
<br>
<br> By grace from Allah and as a favor;
<br> and Allah is Knowing,
<br>  Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And if two parties of the believers quarrel,
<br> make peace  between them;
<br> but if one of them acts wrongfully towards the  other,
<br> fight that which acts wrongfully until it returns to  Allah's command;
<br> then if it returns,
<br> make peace between them  with justice and act equitably;
<br> surely Allah loves those who  act equitably.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.10</b>]
<br>
<br> The believers are but brethren,
<br> therefore make peace  between your brethren and be careful of (your duty to) Allah  that mercy may be had on you.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.11</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> let not (one) people laugh at  (another) people perchance they may be better than they,
<br> nor  let women (laugh) at (other) women,
<br> perchance they may be  better than they;
<br> and do not find fault with your own people  nor call one another by nicknames;
<br> evil is a bad name after  faith,
<br> and whoever does not turn,
<br> these it is that are the  unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.12</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> avoid most of suspicion,
<br> for surely  suspicion in some cases is a sin,
<br> and do not spy nor let  some of you backbite others.
<br> Does one of you like to eat the  flesh of his dead brother?
<br> But you abhor it;
<br> and be careful  of (your duty to) Allah,
<br> surely Allah is Oft-returning (to  mercy),
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.13</b>]
<br>
<br> O you men!
<br> surely We have created you of a male and a  female,
<br> and made you tribes and families that you may know  each other;
<br> surely the most honorable of you with Allah is  the one among you most careful (of his duty);
<br> surely Allah  is Knowing,
<br> Aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.14</b>]
<br>
<br> The dwellers of the desert say:
<br> We believe.
<br> Say:
<br> You do  not believe but say,
<br> We submit;
<br> and faith has not yet  entered into your hearts;
<br> and if you obey Allah and His  Apostle,
<br> He will not diminish aught of your deeds;
<br> surely  Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.15</b>]
<br>
<br> The believers are only those who believe in Allah and  His Apostle then they doubt not and struggle hard with their  wealth and their lives in the way of Allah;
<br> they are the  truthful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Do you apprise Allah of your religion,
<br> and Allah  knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth;
<br> and  Allah is Cognizant of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.17</b>]
<br>
<br> They think that they lay you under an obligation by  becoming Muslims.
<br> Say:
<br> Lay me not under obligation by your  Islam:
<br> rather Allah lays you under an obligation by guiding  you to the faith if you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse49_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>49.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah knows the unseen things of the heavens and  the earth;
<br> and Allah sees what you do.
