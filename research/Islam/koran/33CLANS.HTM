<br><h3>The Clans</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.

<a name = "verse33_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> be careful of (your duty to) Allah and do not  comply with (the wishes of) the unbelievers and the  hypocrites;
<br> surely Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise;
<br>
<a name = "verse33_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord;
<br> surely  Allah is Aware of what you do;
<br>
<a name = "verse33_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And rely on Allah;
<br> and Allah is sufficient for a  Protector.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has not made for any man two hearts within him;
<br> nor  has He made your wives whose backs you liken to the backs of  your mothers as your mothers,
<br> nor has He made those whom you  assert to be your sons your real sons;
<br> these are the words  of your mouths;
<br> and Allah speaks the truth and He guides to  the way.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Assert their relationship to their fathers;
<br> this is more  equitable with Allah;
<br> but if you do not know their fathers,
<br>  then they are your brethren in faith and your friends;
<br> and  there is no blame on you concerning that in which you made a  mistake,
<br> but (concerning) that which your hearts do  purposely (blame may rest on you),
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.6</b>]
<br>
<br> The Prophet has a greater claim on the faithful than they  have on themselves,
<br> and his wives are (as) their mothers;
<br>  and the possessors of relationship have the better claim in  the ordinance of Allah to inheritance,
<br> one with respect to  another,
<br> than (other) believers,
<br> and (than) those who have  fled (their homes),
<br> except that you do some good to your  friends;
<br> this is written in the Book.
<br>    / 7.
<br> And when We made a covenant with the prophets and with  you,
<br> and with Nuh and Ibrahim and Musa and Isa,
<br> son of  Marium,
 and We made with them a strong covenant<br>
<a name = "verse33_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.8</b>]
<br>
<br> That He may question the truthful of their truth,
<br> and He  has prepared for the unbelievers a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.9</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> call to mind the favor of Allah to you  when there came down upon you hosts,
<br> so We sent against them  a strong wind and hosts,
<br> that you saw not,
<br> and Allah is  Seeing what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.10</b>]
<br>
<br> When they came upon you from above you and from below  you,
<br> and when the eyes turned dull,
<br> and the hearts rose up  to the throats,
<br> and you began to think diverse thoughts of  Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.11</b>]
<br>
<br> There the believers were tried and they were shaken with  severe shaking.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a  disease began to say:
<br> Allah and His Apostle did not promise  us (victory) but only to deceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And when a party of them said:
<br> O people of Yasrib!
<br> there  IS no place to stand for you (here),
<br> therefore go back;
<br> and  a party of them asked permission of the prophet,
<br> saying.
<br>  Surely our houses are exposed;
<br> and they were not exposed;
<br>  they only desired to fly away.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And if an entry were made upon them from the outlying  parts of it,
<br> then they were asked to wage war,
<br> they would  certainly have done it,
<br> and they would not have stayed in it  but a little while.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly they had made a covenant with Allah  before,
<br> that) they would not turn (their) backs;
<br> and Allah's  covenant shall be inquired of.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Flight shall not do you any good if you fly from  death or slaughter,
<br> and in that case you will not be allowed  to enjoy yourselves but a little.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Who is it that can withhold you from Allah if He  intends to do you evil,
<br> rather He intends to show you mercy?
<br>  And they will not find for themselves besides Allah any  guardian or a helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah knows indeed those among you who hinder others and  those who say to their brethren:
<br> Come to us;
<br> and they come  not to the fight but a little,
<br>
<a name = "verse33_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Being niggardly with respect to you;
<br> but when fear  comes,
<br> you will see them looking to you,
<br> their eyes rolling  like one swooning because of death;
<br> but when the fear is  gone they smite you with sharp tongues,
<br> being niggardly of  the good things.
<br> These have not believed,
<br> therefore Allah  has made.
<br>their doing naught;
<br> and this is easy to Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.20</b>]
<br>
<br> They think the allies are not gone,
<br> and if the allies  should come (again) they would fain be in the deserts with  the desert Arabs asking for news about you,
<br> and if they were  among you they would not fight save a little.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly you have in the Apostle of Allah an excellent  exemplar for him who hopes in Allah and the latter day and  remembers Allah much.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the believers saw the allies,
<br> they said:
<br> This  is what Allah and His Apostle promised us,
<br> and Allah and His  Apostle spoke the truth;
<br> and it only increased them in faith  and submission.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Of the believers are men who are true to the covenant  which they made with Allah:
<br> so of them is he who  accomplished his vow,
<br> and of them is he who yet waits,
 and  they have not changed in the least<br>
<a name = "verse33_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.24</b>]
<br>
<br> That Allah may reward the truthful for their truth,
<br> and  punish the hypocrites if He please or turn to them  (mercifully);
<br> surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah turned back the unbelievers in their rage;
<br>  they did not obtain any advantage,
<br> and Allah sufficed the  believers in fighting;
<br> and Allah is Strong,
<br> Mighty.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And He drove down those of the followers of the Book who  backed them from their fortresses and He cast awe into their  hearts;
<br> some you killed and you took captive another part.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And He made you heirs to their land and their dwellings  and their property,
<br> and (to) a land which you have not yet  trodden,
<br> and Allah has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.28</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> say to your wives:
<br> If you desire this world's  life and its adornment,
<br> then come,
 I will give you a  provision and allow you to depart a goodly departing<br>
<a name = "verse33_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you desire Allah and His Apostle and the latter  abode,
<br> then surely Allah has prepared for the doers of good  among you a mighty reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.30</b>]
<br>
<br> O wives of the prophet!
<br> whoever of you commits an open  indecency,
<br> the punishment shall be increased to her doubly;
<br>  and this IS easy to Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever of you is obedient to Allah and His Apostle  and does good,
<br> We will give to her her reward doubly,
<br> and We  have prepared for her an honorable sustenance.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.32</b>]
<br>
<br> O wives of the Prophet!
<br> you are not like any other of  the women;
<br> If you will be on your guard,
<br> then be not soft in  (your) speech,
<br> lest he in whose heart is a disease yearn;
<br>  and speak a good word.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And stay in your houses and do not display your finery  like the displaying of the ignorance of yore;
<br> and keep up  prayer,
<br> and pay the poor-rate,
<br> and obey Allah and His  Apostle.
<br> Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness  from you,
<br> O people of the House!
<br> and to purify you a  (thorough) purifying.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And keep to mind what is recited in your houses of the  communications of Allah and the wisdom;
<br> surely Allah is  Knower of subtleties,
<br> Aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the men who submit and the women who submit,
<br> and  the believing men and the believing women,
<br> and the obeying  men and the obeying women,
<br> and the truthful men and the  truthful women,
<br> and the patient men and the patient women  and the humble men and the humble women,
<br> and the almsgiving  men and the almsgiving women,
<br> and the fasting men and the  fasting women,
<br> and the men who guard their private parts and  the women who guard,
<br> and the men who remember Allah much and  the women who remember-- Allah has prepared for them  forgiveness and a mighty reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And it behoves not a believing man and a believing woman  that they should have any choice in their matter when Allah  and His Apostle have decided a matter;
<br> and whoever disobeys  Allah and His Apostle,
<br> he surely strays off a manifest  straying.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you said to him to whom Allah had shown favor  and to whom you had shown a favor:
<br> Keep your wife to  yourself and be careful of (your duty to) Allah;
<br> and you  concealed in your soul what Allah would bring to light,
<br> and  you feared men,
<br> and Allah had a greater right that you  should fear Him.
<br> But when Zaid had accomplished his want of  her,
<br> We gave her to you as a wife,
<br> so that there should be  no difficulty for the believers in respect of the wives of  their adopted sons,
<br> when they have accomplished their want  of them;
<br> and Allah's command shall be performed.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.38</b>]
<br>
<br> There is no harm in the Prophet doing that which Allah  has ordained for him;
<br> such has been the course of Allah with  respect to those who have gone before;
<br> and the command of  Allah is a decree that is made absolute:
<br>
<a name = "verse33_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who deliver the messages of Allah and fear Him,
<br>  and do not fear any one but Allah;
<br> and Allah is sufficient  to take account.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,
<br> but he is  the Apostle of Allah and the Last of the prophets;
<br> and Allah  is cognizant of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.41</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> remember Allah,
<br> remembering  frequently,
<br>
<a name = "verse33_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And glorify Him morning and evening.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.43</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who sends His blessings on you,
<br> and (so do) His  angels,
<br> that He may bring you forth out of utter darkness  into the light;
<br> and He is Merciful to the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Their salutation on the day that they meet Him shall be,
<br>  Peace,
<br> and He has prepared for them an honourable reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.45</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> surely We have sent you as a witness,
<br> and as  a bearer of good news and as a warner,
<br>
<a name = "verse33_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And as one inviting to Allah by His permission,
<br> and as a  light-giving torch.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And give to the believers the good news that they shall  have a great grace from Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And be not compliant to the unbelievers and the  hypocrites,
<br> and leave unregarded their annoying talk,
<br> and  rely on Allah;
<br> and Allah is sufficient as a Protector.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.49</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> when you marry the believing women,
<br>  then divorce them before you touch them,
<br> you have in their  case no term which you should reckon;
<br> so make some provision  for them and send them forth a goodly sending forth.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.50</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> surely We have made lawful to you your wives  whom you have given their dowries,
<br> and those whom your right  hand possesses out of those whom Allah has given to you as  prisoners of war,
<br> and the daughters of your paternal uncles  and the daughters of your paternal aunts,
<br> and the daughters  of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal  aunts who fled with you;
<br> and a believing woman if she gave  herself to the Prophet,
<br> if the Prophet desired to marry  her-- specially for you,
<br> not for the (rest of) believers;
<br> We  know what We have ordained for them concerning their wives  and those whom their right hands possess in order that no  blame may attach to you;
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.51</b>]
<br>
<br> You may put off whom you please of them,
<br> and you may  take to you whom you please,
<br> and whom you desire of those  whom you had separated provisionally;
<br> no blame attaches to  you;
<br> this is most proper,
<br> so that their eyes may be cool and  they may not grieve,
<br> and that they should be pleased,
<br> all of  them with what you give them,
<br> and Allah knows what is in  your hearts;
<br> and Allah is Knowing,
<br> Forbearing.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.52</b>]
<br>
<br> It is not allowed to you to take women afterwards,
<br> nor  that you should change them for other wives,
<br> though their  beauty be pleasing to you,
<br> except what your right hand  possesses and Allah is Watchful over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.53</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not enter the houses of the  Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal,
<br> not  waiting for its cooking being finished-- but when you are  invited,
<br> enter,
<br> and when you have taken the food,
<br> then  disperse-- not seeking to listen to talk;
<br> surely this gives  the Prophet trouble,
<br> but he forbears from you,
<br> and Allah  does not forbear from the truth And when you ask of them any  goods,
<br> ask of them from behind a curtain;
<br> this is purer for  your hearts and (for) their hearts;
<br> and it does not behove  you that you should give trouble to the Apostle of Allah,
<br>  nor that you should marry his wives after him ever;
<br> surely  this is grievous in the sight of Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.54</b>]
<br>
<br> If you do a thing openly or do it in secret,
<br> then surely  Allah is Cognizant of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.55</b>]
<br>
<br> There is no blame on them in respect of their fathers,
<br>  nor their brothers,
<br> nor their brothers' sons,
<br> nor their  sisters' sons nor their own women,
<br> nor of what their right  hands possess;
<br> and be careful of (your duty to) Allah;
<br>  surely Allah is a witness of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet;
<br> O you who  believe!
<br> call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him  with a (becoming) salutation.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who speak evil things of Allah and  His Apostle,
<br> Allah has cursed them in this world and the  here after,
<br> and He has prepared for them a chastisement  bringing disgrace.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who speak evil things of the believing men and  the believing women without their having earned (it),
<br> they  are guilty indeed of a false accusation and a manifest sin.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.59</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> say to your wives and your daughters and the  women of the believers that they let down upon them their  over-garments;
<br> this will be more proper,
<br> that they may be  known,
<br> and thus they will not be given trouble;
<br> and Allah is  Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.60</b>]
<br>
<br> If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease  and the agitators in the city do not desist,
<br> We shall most  certainly set you over them,
<br> then they shall not be your  neighbors in it but for a little while;
<br>
<a name = "verse33_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.61</b>]
<br>
<br> Cursed:
<br> wherever they are found they shall be seized and  murdered,
<br> a (horrible) murdering.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.62</b>]
<br>
<br> (Such has been) the course of Allah with respect to  those who have gone before;
<br> and you shall not find any  change in the course of Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Men ask you about the hour;
<br> say:
<br> The knowledge of it is  only with Allah,
<br> and what will make you comprehend that the  :
<br> hour may be nigh.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah has cursed the unbelievers and has prepared  for them a burning fire,
<br>
<a name = "verse33_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.65</b>]
<br>
<br> To abide therein for a long time;
<br> they shall not find a  protector or a helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.66</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when their faces shall be turned back into  the fire,
<br> they shall say:
<br> O would that we had obeyed Allah  and obeyed the Apostle!
<br>
<a name = "verse33_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall say:
<br> O our Lord!
<br> surely we obeyed our  leaders and our great men,
<br> so they led us astray from the  path;
<br>
<a name = "verse33_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.68</b>]
<br>
<br> O our Lord!
<br> give them a double punishment and curse them  with a great curse.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.69</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> be not like those who spoke evil  things of Musa,
<br> but Allah cleared him of what they said,
<br> and  he was worthy of regard with Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse33_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.70</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> be careful of(your duty to) Allah and  speak the right word,
<br>
<a name = "verse33_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>33.71</b>]
<br>
<br> He will put your deeds into a right state for you,
<br> and  forgive you your faults;
<br> and whoever obeys Allah and His  Apostle,
<br> he indeed achieves a mighty success.
<br>

<br> Surely We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth  and the mountains,
<br> but they refused to be unfaithful to it  and feared from it,
<br> and man has turned unfaithful to it;
<br>  surely he is unjust,
<br> ignorant;

<br> So Allah will chastise the hypocritical men and the  hypocritical women and the polytheistic men and the  polytheistic women,
<br> and Allah will turn (mercifully) to the  believing women,
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
