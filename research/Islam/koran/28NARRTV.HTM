<p><h3>Book 28</h3>
<br><h3>The Narratives</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse28_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ta sin Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.2</b>]
<br>
<br> These are the verses of the Book that makes (things)  clear.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.3</b>]
<br>
<br> We recite to you from the account of Musa and Firon with  truth for people who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Firon exalted himself in the land and made its  people into parties,
<br> weakening one party from among them;
<br> he  slaughtered their sons and let their women live;
<br> surely he  was one of the mischiefmakers.
  <br>
<a name = "verse28_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were  deemed weak in the land,
<br> and to make them the Imams,
<br> and to  make them the heirs,
<br>
<a name = "verse28_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And to grant them power in the land,
<br> and to make Firon  and Haman and their hosts see from them what they feared.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And We revealed to Musa's mothers,
<br> saying:
<br> Give him suck,
<br>  then when you fear for him,
<br> cast him into the river and do  not fear nor grieve;
<br> surely We wi!
<br>l bring him back to you  and make him one of the apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon's family took him up that he might be an enemy  and a grief for them;
<br> surely Firon and Haman and their hosts  were wrongdoers.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon's wife said:
<br> A refreshment of the eye to me and  to you;
<br> do not slay him;
<br> maybe he will be useful to us,
<br> or  we may take him for a son;
<br> and they did not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And the heart of Musa's mother was free (from anxiety)  she would have almost disclosed it had We not strengthened  her heart so that she might be of the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And she said to his sister:
<br> Follow him up.
<br> So she  watched him from a distance while they did not perceive,
<br>
<a name = "verse28_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And We ordained that he refused to suck any foster  mother before,
<br> so she said:
<br> Shall I point out to you the  people of a house who will take care of him for you,
<br> and  they will be benevolent to him?
<br>
<a name = "verse28_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.13</b>]
<br>
<br> So We gave him back to his mother that her eye might be  refreshed,
<br> and that she might no grieve,
<br> and that she might  know that the promise of Allah is true,
<br> but most of them do  not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And when he attained his maturity and became full grown,
<br>  We granted him wisdom and knowledge;
<br> and thus do We reward  those who do good (to others).
<br>
<a name = "verse28_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And he went into the city at a time of unvigilance on  the part of its people,
<br> so he found therein two men  fighting,
<br> one being of his party and the other of his foes,
<br>  and he who was of his party cried out to him for help  against him who was of his enemies,
<br> so Musa struck him with  his fist and killed him.
<br> He said:
<br> This is on account of the  Shaitan's doing;
<br> surely he is an enemy,
<br> openly leading  astray.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.16</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> surely I have done harm to myself,
<br> so  do Thou protect me.
<br> So He protected him;
<br> surely He is the  Forgiving,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.17</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> because Thou hast bestowed a favor on  me,
<br> I shall never be a backer of the guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And he was in the city,
<br> fearing,
<br> awaiting,
<br> when lo!
<br> he  who had asked his assistance the day before was crying out  to him for aid.
<br> Musa said to him:
<br> You are most surely one  erring manifestly.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.19</b>]
<br>
<br> So when he desired to seize him who was an enemy to them  both,
<br> he said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> do you intend to kill me as you  killed a person yesterday?
<br> You desire nothing but that you  should be a tyrant in the land,
<br> and you do not desire to be  of those who act aright.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And a man came running from the remotest part of the  city.
<br> He said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> surely the chiefs are consulting  together to slay you,
<br> therefore depart (at once);
<br> surely I  am of those who wish well to you.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.21</b>]
<br>
<br> So he went forth therefrom,
<br> fearing,
<br> awaiting,
<br> (and) he  said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> deliver me from the unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And when he turned his face towards Madyan,
<br> he said:
<br>  Maybe my Lord will guide me in the right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And when he came to the water of Madyan,
<br> he found on it  a group of men watering,
<br> and he found besides them two women  keeping back (their flocks).
<br> He said:
<br> What is the matter  with you?
<br> They said:
<br> We cannot water until the shepherds  take away (their sheep) from the water,
<br> and our father is a  very old man.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.24</b>]
<br>
<br> So he watered (their sheep) for them,
<br> then went back to  the shade and said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> surely I stand in need of  whatever good Thou mayest send down to me.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully.
<br>  She said:
<br> My father invites you that he may give you the  reward of your having watered for us.
<br> So when he came to him  and gave to him the account,
<br> he said:
<br> Fear not,
<br> you are  secure from the unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Said one of them:
<br> O my father!
<br> employ him,
<br> surely the  best of those that you can employ is the strong man,
<br> the  faithful one.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.27</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I desire to marry one of these two daughters of  mine to you on condition that you should serve me for eight  years;
<br> but if you complete ten,
<br> it will be of your own free  will,
<br> and I do not wish to be hard to you;
<br> if Allah please,
<br>  you will find me one of the good.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.28</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> This shall be (an agreement) between me and  you;
<br> whichever of the two terms I fulfill,
<br> there shall be no  wrongdoing to me;
<br> and Allah is a witness of what we say.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.29</b>]
<br>
<br> So when Musa had fulfilled the term,
<br> and he journeyed  with his family,
<br> he perceived on this side of the mountain a  fire.
<br> He said to his family:
<br> Wait,
<br> I have seen a fire,
<br> maybe  I will bring to you from it some news or a brand of fire,
<br> so  that you may warm yourselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And when he came to it,
<br> a voice was uttered from the  right side of the valley in the blessed spot of the bush,
<br>  saying:
<br> O Musa!
<br> surely I am Allah,
<br> the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And saying:
<br> Cast down you staff.
<br> So when he saw it in  motion as if it were a serpent,
<br> he turned back retreating,
<br>  and did not return.
<br> O Musa!
<br> come forward and fear not;
<br>  surely you are of those who are secure;
<br>
<a name = "verse28_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Enter your hand into the opening of your bosom,
<br> it will  come forth white without evil,
<br> and draw your hand to  yourself to ward off fear:
<br> so these two shall be two  arguments from your Lord to Firon and his chiefs,
<br> surely  they are a transgressing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.33</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> surely I killed one of them,
<br> so I fear  lest they should slay me;
<br>
<a name = "verse28_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And my brother,
<br> Haroun,
<br> he is more eloquent of tongue  than 1,
<br> therefore send him with me as an aider,
<br> verifying  me:
<br> surely I fear that they would reject me.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.35</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> We will strengthen your arm with your brother,
<br>  and We will give you both an authority,
<br> so that they shall  not reach you;
<br> (go) with Our signs;
<br> you two and those who  follow you shall be uppermost.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.36</b>]
<br>
<br> So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs,
<br> they  said:
<br> This is nothing but forged enchantment,
<br> and we never  heard of it amongst our fathers of old.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And Musa said:
<br> My Lord knows best who comes with  guidance from Him,
<br> and whose shall be the good end of the  abode;
<br> surely the unjust shall not be successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon said:
<br> O chiefs!
<br> I do not know of any god for  you besides myself;
<br> therefore kindle a fire for me,
<br> O Haman,
<br>  for brick,
<br> then prepare for me a lofty building so that I  may obtain knowledge of Musa's God,
<br> and most surely I think  him to be one of the liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And he was unjustly proud in the land,
<br> he and his hosts,
<br>  and they deemed that they would not be brought back to Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.40</b>]
<br>
<br> So We caught hold of him and his hosts,
<br> then We cast  them into the sea,
<br> and see how was the end of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made them Imams who call to the fire,
<br> and on the  day of resurrection they shall not be assisted.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And We caused a curse to follow them in this world,
<br> and  on the day of resurrection they shall be of those made to  appear hideous.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave Musa the Book after We had  destroyed the former generations,
<br> clear arguments for men  and a guidance and a mercy,
<br> that they may be mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And you were not on the western side when We revealed to  Musa the commandment,
<br> and you were not among the witnesses;
<br>
<a name = "verse28_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.45</b>]
<br>
<br> But We raised up generations,
<br> then life became prolonged  to them;
<br> and you were not dwelling among the people of  Madyan,
<br> reciting to them Our communications,
<br> but We were the  senders.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And you were not on this side of the mountain when We  called,
<br> but a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a  people to whom no warner came before you,
<br> that they may be  mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And were it not that there should befall them a disaster  for what their hands have sent before,
<br> then they should say:
<br>  Our Lord!
<br> why didst Thou not send to us an apostle so that  we should have followed Thy communications and been of the  believers !
<br>
<a name = "verse28_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.48</b>]
<br>
<br> But (now) when the truth has come to them from Us,
<br> they  say:
<br> Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa?
<br>  What!
<br> did they not disbelieve in what Musa was given before?
<br>  They say:
<br> Two magicians backing up each other;
<br> and they say:
<br>  Surely we are unbelievers in all.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Then bring some (other) book from Allah which is a  better guide than both of them,
<br> (that) I may follow it,
<br> if  you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.50</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they do not answer you,
<br> then know that they only  follow their low desires;
<br> and who is more erring than he who  follows his low desires without any guidance from Allah?
<br>  Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have made the word to reach them so  that they may be mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.52</b>]
<br>
<br> (As to) those whom We gave the Book before it,
<br> they are  believers in it.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is recited to them they say:
<br> We believe in  it surely it is the truth from our Lord;
<br> surely we were  submitters before this.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.54</b>]
<br>
<br> These shall be granted their reward twice,
<br> because they  are steadfast and they repel evil with good and spend out of  what We have given them.
  <br>
<a name = "verse28_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.55</b>]
<br>
<br>  And when they hear idle talk they turn aside from it and  say:
<br> We shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds;
<br>  peace be on you,
<br> we do not desire the ignorant.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely you cannot guide whom you love,
<br> but Allah guides  whom He pleases,
<br> and He knows best the followers of the  right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> If we follow the guidance with you,
<br> we  shall be carried off from our country.
<br> What !
<br> have We not  settled them in a safe,
<br> sacred territory to which fruits of  every kind shall be drawn?
<br>-- a sustenance from Us;
<br> but most of  them do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many a town have We destroyed which exulted in  its means of subsistence,
<br> so these are their abodes,
<br> they  have not been dwelt in after them except a little,
<br> and We  are the inheritors,
<br>
<a name = "verse28_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord never destroyed the towns until He raised  in their metropolis an apostle,
<br> reciting to them Our  communications,
<br> and We never destroyed the towns except when  their people were unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And whatever things you have been given are only a  provision of this world's life and its adornment,
<br> and  whatever is with Allah is better and more lasting;
<br> do you  not then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse28_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.61</b>]
<br>
<br> Is he to whom We have promised a goodly promise which he  shall meet with like him whom We have provided with the  provisions of this world's life,
<br> then on the day of  resurrection he shall be of those who are brought up?
<br>
<a name = "verse28_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.62</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when He will call them and say:
<br> Where are  those whom you deemed to be My associates?
<br>
<a name = "verse28_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Those against whom the sentence has become confirmed  will say:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> these are they whom we caused to err;
<br> we  caused them to err as we ourselves did err;
<br> to Thee we  declare ourselves to be clear (of them);
<br> they never served  Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.64</b>]
<br>
<br> And it will be said:
<br> Call your associate-gods.
<br> So they  will call upon them,
<br> but they will not answer them,
<br> and they  shall see the punishment;
<br> would that they had followed the  right way!
<br>
<a name = "verse28_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when He shall call them and say:
<br> What was  the answer you gave to the apostles?
<br>
<a name = "verse28_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Then the pleas shall become obscure to them on that day,
<br>  so they shall not ask each other.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.67</b>]
<br>
<br> But as to him who repents and believes and does good,
<br>  maybe he will be among the successful:
<br>
<a name = "verse28_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord creates and chooses whom He pleases;
<br> to  choose is not theirs;
<br> glory be to Allah,
<br> and exalted be He  above what they associate (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse28_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what  they manifest.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.70</b>]
<br>
<br> And He is Allah,
<br> there is no god but He!
<br> All praise is  due to Him in this (life) and the hereafter,
<br> and His is the  judgment,
<br> and to Him you shall be brought back.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.71</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Tell me,
<br> if Allah were to make the night to  continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection,
<br>  who is the god besides Allah that could bring you light?
<br> Do  you not then hear?
<br>
<a name = "verse28_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.72</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Tell me,
<br> if Allah were to make the day to continue  incessantly on you till the day of resurrection,
<br> who is the  god besides Allah that could bring you the night in which  you take rest?
<br> Do you not then see?
<br>
<a name = "verse28_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And out of His mercy He has made for you the night and  the day,
<br> that you may rest therein,
<br> and that you may seek of  His grace,
<br> and that you may give thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when He shall call them and say:
<br> Where  are those whom you deemed to be My associates?

<br> And We will draw forth from among every nation a witness  and say:
<br> Bring your proof;
<br> then shall they know that the  truth is Allah's,
<br> and that which they forged shall depart  from them.

<br> Surely Qaroun was of the people of Musa,
<br> but he rebelled  against them,
<br> and We had given him of the treasures,
<br> so much  so that his hoards of wealth would certainly weigh down a  company of men possessed of great strength.
<br> When his people  said to him:
<br> Do not exult,
<br> surely Allah does not love the  exultant;
<br>
<a name = "verse28_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.77</b>]
<br>
<br> And seek by means of what Allah has given you the future  abode,
<br> and do not neglect your portion of this world,
<br> and do  good (to others) as Allah has done good to you,
<br> and do not  seek to make mischief in the land,
<br> surely Allah does not  love the mischief-makers.

<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I have been given this only on account of the  knowledge I have.
<br> Did he not know that Allah had destroyed  before him of the generations those who were mightier in  strength than he and greater in assemblage?
<br> And the guilty  shall not be asked about their faults.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_79"></a>

[<b>28.79</b>]
<br>
<br> So he went forth to his people in his finery.
<br> Those who  desire this world's life said:
<br> O would that we had the like  of what Qaroun is given;
<br> most surely he is possessed of  mighty good fortune.
<br>

[<b>28.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who were given the knowledge said:
<br> Woe to you!
<br>  Allah's reward is better for him who believes and does good,
<br>  and none is made to receive this except the patient.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_81"></a>

[<b>28.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus We made the earth to swallow up him and his abode;
<br>  so he had no body of helpers to assist him against Allah nor  was he of those who can defend themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who yearned for his place only the day before  began to say:
<br> Ah!
<br> (know) that Allah amplifies and straitens  the means of subsistence for whom He pleases of His  servants;
<br> had not Allah been gracious to us,
<br> He would most  surely have abased us;
<br> ah!
<br> (know) that the ungrateful are  never successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_83"></a>

[<b>28.83</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) that future abode,
 We assign it to those who  have no desire to exalt themselves in the earth nor to make  mischief and the good end is for those who guard (against  evil)<br>
<a name = "verse28_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.84</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever brings good,
<br> he shall have better than it,
<br> and  whoever brings evil,
<br> those who do evil shall not be rewarded  (for) aught except what they did.

<br> Most surely He Who has made the Quran binding on you  will bring you back to the destination.
<br> Say:
<br> My Lord knows  best him who has brought the guidance and him who is in  manifest error.

[<b>28.86</b>]
<br>
<br> And you did not expect that the Book would be inspired  to you,
<br> but it is a mercy from your Lord,
<br> therefore be not a  backer-up of the unbelievers.
<br>

<br>
<br> And let them not turn you aside from the communications  of Allah after they have been revealed to you,
<br> and call  (men) to your Lord and be not of the polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse28_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>28.88</b>]
<br>
<br> And call not with Allah any other god;
<br> there is no god  but He,
<br> every thing is perishable but He;
<br> His is the  judgment,
<br> and to Him you shall be brought back.
