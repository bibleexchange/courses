<p><h3>Book 54</h3>
<br><h3>The Moon</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse54_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.1</b>]
<br>
<br> The hour drew nigh and the moon did rend asunder.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they see a miracle they turn aside and say:
<br>  Transient magic.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And they call (it) a lie,
<br> and follow their low desires;
<br>  and every affair has its appointed term.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.4</b>]
<br>
 And certainly some narratives have come to them wherein  is prevention--<br>
<a name = "verse54_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Consummate wisdom-- but warnings do not avail;
<br>
<a name = "verse54_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.6</b>]
<br>
<br> So turn (your) back on them (for) the day when the  inviter shall invite them to a hard task,
<br>
<a name = "verse54_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Their eyes cast down,
<br> going forth from their graves as if  they were scattered locusts,
<br>
<a name = "verse54_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Hastening to the inviter.
<br> The unbelievers shall say:
<br> This  is a hard day.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Before them the people of Nuh rejected,
<br> so they rejected  Our servant and called (him) mad,
<br> and he was driven away.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore he called upon his Lord:
<br> I am overcome,
<br> come  Thou then to help.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.11</b>]
<br>
 So We opened the gates of the cloud with water pouring<br>
<a name = "verse54_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made water to flow forth in the land in springs,
<br>  so the water gathered together according to a measure  already ordained.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.13</b>]
<br>
 And We bore him on that which was made of planks and  nails<br>
<a name = "verse54_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Sailing,
<br> before Our eyes,
<br> a reward for him who was  denied.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We left it as a sign,
 but is there anyone  who<br>
<a name = "verse54_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.16</b>]
<br>
<br> How (great) was then My punishment and My warning!
<br>
<a name = "verse54_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have made the Quran easy for  remembrance,
<br> but is there anyone who will mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse54_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Ad treated (the truth) as a lie,
<br> so how (great) was My  punishment and My warning!
<br>
<a name = "verse54_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.19</b>]
<br>
 Surely We sent on them a tornado in a day of bitter  ill-luck<br>
<a name = "verse54_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Tearing men away as if they were the trunks of  palm-trees torn up.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.21</b>]
<br>
<br> How (great) was then My punishment and My warning!
<br>
<a name = "verse54_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have made the Quran easy for  remembrance,
<br> but is there anyone who will mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse54_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Samood rejected the warning.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.24</b>]
<br>
<br> So they said:
<br> What!
<br> a single mortal from among us!
<br> Shall  we follow him?
<br> Most surely we shall in that case be in sure  error and distress:
<br>
<a name = "verse54_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Has the reminder been made to light upon him from among  us?
<br> Nay!
<br> he is an insolent liar!
<br>
<a name = "verse54_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Tomorrow shall they know who is the liar,
<br> the insolent  one.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We are going to send the she-camel as a trial for  them;
<br> therefore watch them and have patience.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And inform them that the water is shared between them;
<br>  every share of the water shall be regulated.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.29</b>]
<br>
<br> But they called their companion,
<br> so he took (the sword)  and slew (her).
<br>
<a name = "verse54_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.30</b>]
<br>
<br> How (great) was then My punishment and My warning!
<br>
<a name = "verse54_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We sent upon them a single cry,
<br> so they were like  the dry fragments of trees which the maker of an enclosure  collects.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have made the Quran easy for  remembrance,
<br> but is there anyone who will mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse54_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.33</b>]
<br>
<br> The people of Lut treated the warning.
<br> as a lie.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We sent upon them a stonestorm,
<br> except Lut's  followers;
<br> We saved them a little before daybreak,
<br>
<a name = "verse54_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.35</b>]
<br>
<br> A favor from Us;
<br> thus do We reward him who gives thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly he warned them of Our violent seizure,
<br> but  they obstinately disputed the warning.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly they endeavored to turn him from his  guests,
<br> but We blinded their eyes;
<br> so taste My chastisement  and My warning.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly a lasting chastisement overtook them in  the morning.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.39</b>]
<br>
<br> So taste My chastisement and My warning.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have made the Quran easy for  remembrance,
<br> but is there anyone who will mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse54_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly the warning came to Firon's people.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.42</b>]
<br>
<br> They rejected all Our communications,
<br> so We overtook  them after.
<br>the manner of a Mighty,
<br> Powerful One.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Are the unbelievers of yours better than these,
<br> or is  there an exemption for you in the scriptures?
<br>
<a name = "verse54_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they say:
<br> We are a host allied together to help  each other?
<br>
<a name = "verse54_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Soon shall the hosts be routed,
<br> and they shall turn  (their) backs.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> the hour is their promised time,
<br> and the hour shall  be most grievous and bitter.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the guilty are in error and distress.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.48</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when they shall be dragged upon their faces  into the fire;
<br> taste the touch of hell.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have created everything according to a  measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And Our command is but one,
<br> as the twinkling of an eye.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have already destroyed the likes of  you,
<br> but is there anyone who will mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse54_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And everything they have done is in the writings.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And everything small and great is written down.
<br>
<a name = "verse54_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in  gardens and rivers,
<br>
<a name = "verse54_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>54.55</b>]
<br>
<br> In the seat of honor with a most Powerful King.
