<p><h3>Book 19</h3>
<br><h3>Marium</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
</p>
<a name = "verse19_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Kaf Ha Ya Ain Suad.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.2</b>]
<br>
<br> A mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zakariya.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.3</b>]
<br>
<br> When he called upon his Lord in a low voice,
<br>
<a name = "verse19_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.4</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> surely my bones are weakened and my head  flares with hoariness,
<br> and,
<br> my Lord!
<br> I have never been  unsuccessful in my prayer to Thee:
<br>
<a name = "verse19_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely I fear my cousins after me,
<br> and my wife is barren,
<br>  therefore grant me from Thyself an heir,
<br>
<a name = "verse19_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Who should inherit me and inherit from the children of Yaqoub,
<br>  and make him,
<br> my Lord,
<br> one in whom Thou art well pleased.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.7</b>]
<br>
<br> O Zakariya!
<br> surely We give you good news of a boy whose name  shall be Yahya:
<br> We have not made before anyone his equal.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.8</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> when shall I have a son,
<br> and my wife is  barren,
<br> and I myself have reached indeed the extreme degree of  old age?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.9</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> So shall it be,
<br> your Lord says:
<br> It is easy to Me,
<br> and  indeed I created you before,
<br> when you were nothing.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.10</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> give me a sign.
<br> He said:
<br> Your sign is that  you will not be able to speak to the people three nights while in  sound health.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.11</b>]
<br>
<br> So he went forth to his people from his place of worship,
<br>  then he made known to them that they should glorify (Allah)  morning and evening.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.12</b>]
<br>
<br> O Yahya!
<br> take hold of the Book with strength,
 and We granted  him wisdom while yet a child<br>
<a name = "verse19_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And tenderness from Us and purity,
<br> and he was one who guarded  (against evil),
<br>
<a name = "verse19_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And dutiful to his parents,
<br> and he was not insolent,
<br>  disobedient.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And peace on him on the day he was born,
<br> and on the day he  dies,
 and on the day he is raised to life<br>
<a name = "verse19_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And mention Marium in the Book when she drew aside from her  family to an eastern place;
<br>
<a name = "verse19_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.17</b>]
<br>
<br> So she took a veil (to screen herself) from them;
<br> then We  sent to her Our spirit,
<br> and there appeared to her a well-made  man.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.18</b>]
<br>
<br> She said:
<br> Surely I fly for refuge from you to the Beneficent  God,
<br> if you are one guarding (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse19_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.19</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I am only a messenger of your Lord:
<br> That I will give  you a pure boy.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.20</b>]
<br>
<br> She said:
<br> When shall I have a boy and no mortal has yet  touched me,
<br> nor have I been unchaste?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.21</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Even so;
<br> your Lord says:
<br> It is easy to Me:
<br> and that  We may make him a sign to men and a mercy from Us,
<br> and it is a  matter which has been decreed.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.22</b>]
<br>
<br> So she conceived him;
<br> then withdrew herself with him to a  remote place.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And the throes (of childbirth) compelled her to betake  herself to the trunk of a palm tree.
<br> She said:
<br> Oh,
<br> would that I  had died before this,
<br> and had been a thing quite forgotten!
<br>
<a name = "verse19_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Then (the child) called out to her from beneath her:
<br> Grieve  not,
<br> surely your Lord has made a stream to flow beneath you;
 <br>
<a name = "verse19_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And shake towards you the trunk of the palmtree,
<br> it will drop  on you fresh ripe dates:
<br>
<a name = "verse19_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.26</b>]
<br>
<br> So eat and drink and refresh the eye.
<br> Then if you see any  mortal,
<br> say:
<br> Surely I have vowed a fast to the Beneficent God,
<br> so  I shall not speak to any man today.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And she came to her people with him,
<br> carrying him (with her).
<br>  They said:
<br> O Marium!
<br> surely you have done a strange thing.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.28</b>]
<br>
<br> O sister of Haroun!
<br> your father was not a bad man,
<br> nor,
<br> was  your mother an unchaste woman.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.29</b>]
<br>
<br> But she pointed to him.
<br> They said:
<br> How should we speak to one  who was a child in the cradle?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.30</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely I am a servant of Allah;
<br> He has given me the  Book and made me a prophet;
<br>
<a name = "verse19_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And He has made me blessed wherever I may be,
<br> and He has  enjoined on me prayer and poor-rate so long as I live;
<br>
<a name = "verse19_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And dutiful to my mother,
<br> and He has not made me insolent,
<br>  unblessed;
<br>
<a name = "verse19_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And peace on me on the day I was born,
<br> and on the day I die,
<br>  and on the day I am raised to life.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Such is Isa,
<br> son of Marium;
<br> (this is) the saying of truth  about which they dispute.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.35</b>]
<br>
<br> It beseems not Allah that He should take to Himself a !
<br> son,
<br>  glory to be Him;
<br> when He has decreed a matter He only says to it  "Be,
<br>" and it is.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord,
<br> therefore serve  Him;
<br> this is the right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.37</b>]
<br>
<br> But parties from among them disagreed with each other,
<br> so woe  to those who disbelieve,
 because of presence on a great<br>
<a name = "verse19_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.38</b>]
<br>
<br> How clearly shall they hear and how clearly shall they see on  the day when they come to Us;
<br> but the unjust this day are in  manifest error.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And warn them of the day of intense regret,
<br> when the matter  shall have been decided;
<br> and they are (now) in negligence and  they do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We inherit the earth and all those who are on it,
<br> and  to Us they shall be returned.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And mention Ibrahim in the Book;
<br> surely he was a truthful  man,
<br> a prophet.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.42</b>]
<br>
<br> When he said to his father;
<br> O my father!
<br> why do you worship  what neither hears nor sees,
<br> nor does it avail you in the least:
<br>
<a name = "verse19_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.43</b>]
<br>
<br> O my father!
<br> truly the knowledge has come to me which has not  come to you,
<br> therefore follow me,
<br> I will guide you on a right  path:
<br>
<a name = "verse19_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.44</b>]
<br>
<br> O my father!
<br> serve not the Shaitan,
<br> surely the Shaitan is  disobedient to the Beneficent God:
<br>
<a name = "verse19_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.45</b>]
<br>
<br> O my father!
<br> surely I fear that a punishment from the  Beneficent God should afflict you so that you should be a friend  of the Shaitan.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.46</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Do you dislike my gods,
<br> O Ibrahim?
<br> If you do not  desist I will certainly revile you,
<br> and leave me for a time.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.47</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Peace be on you,
<br> I will pray to my Lord to forgive  you;
<br> surely He is ever Affectionate to me:
<br>
<a name = "verse19_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And I will withdraw from you and what you call on besides  Allah,
<br> and I will call upon my Lord;
<br> may be I shall not remain  unblessed in calling upon my Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.49</b>]
<br>
<br> So when he withdrew from them and what they worshipped  besides Allah,
<br> We gave to him Ishaq and Yaqoub,
<br> and each one of  them We made a prophet.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And We granted to them of Our mercy,
<br> and We left (behind  them) a truthful mention of eminence for them.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And mention Musa in the Book;
<br> surely he was one purified,
<br> and  he was an apostle,
<br> a prophet.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And We called to him from the blessed side of the mountain,
<br>  and We made him draw nigh,
<br> holding communion (with Us).
<br>
<a name = "verse19_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave to him out of Our mercy his brother Haroun a  prophet.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And mention Ismail in the Book;
<br> surely he was truthful in  (his) promise,
<br> and he was an apostle,
<br> a prophet.
 <br>
<a name = "verse19_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And he enjoined on his family prayer and almsgiving,
<br> and  was one in whom his Lord was well pleased.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And mention Idris in the Book;
<br> surely he was a truthful man,
<br>  a prophet,
<br>
<a name = "verse19_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And We raised him high in Heaven.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.58</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they on whom Allah bestowed favors,
<br> from among the  prophets of the seed of Adam,
<br> and of those whom We carried with  Nuh,
<br> and of the seed of Ibrahim and Israel,
<br> and of those whom We  guided and chose;
<br> when the communications of the Beneficent God  were recited to them,
<br> they fell down making obeisance and  weeping.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.59</b>]
<br>
<br> But there came after them an evil generation,
<br> who neglected  prayers and followed and sensual desires,
<br> so they win meet  perdition,
<br>
<a name = "verse19_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Except such as repent and believe and do good,
<br> these shall  enter the garden,
<br> and they shall not be dealt with unjustly in  any way:
<br>
<a name = "verse19_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.61</b>]
<br>
<br> The gardens of perpetuity which the Beneficent God has  promised to His servants while unseen;
<br> surely His promise shall  come to pass.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.62</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall not hear therein any vain discourse,
<br> but only:
<br>  Peace,
<br> and they shall have their sustenance therein morning and  evening.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.63</b>]
<br>
<br> This is the garden which We cause those of Our servants to  inherit who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse19_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.64</b>]
<br>
<br> And we do not descend but by the command of your Lord;
<br> to Him  belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and  whatever is between these,
<br> and your Lord is not forgetful.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.65</b>]
<br>
<br> The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between  them,
<br> so serve Him and be patient in His service.
<br> Do you know any  one equal to Him?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.66</b>]
<br>
<br> And says man:
<br> What!
<br> when I am dead shall I truly be brought  forth alive?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.67</b>]
<br>
<br> Does not man remember that We created him before,
<br> when he was  nothing?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.68</b>]
<br>
<br> So by your Lord!
<br> We will most certainly gather them together  and the Shaitans,
<br> then shall We certainly cause them to be  present round hell on their knees.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We will most certainly draw forth from every sect of  them him who is most exorbitantly rebellious against the  Beneficent God.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.70</b>]
<br>
<br> Again We do certainly know best those who deserve most to be  burned therein.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And there is not one of you but shall come to it;
<br> this is an  unavoidable decree of your Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And We will deliver those who guarded (against evil),
<br> and We  will leave the unjust therein on their knees.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our clear communications are recited to them,
<br> those  who disbelieve say to those who believe:
<br> Which of the two parties  is best in abiding and best in assembly?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many of the generations have We destroyed before them  who were better in respect of goods and outward appearance!
 <br>
<a name = "verse19_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.75</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> As for him who remains in error,
<br> the Beneficent God will  surely prolong his length of days,
<br> until they see what they were  threatened with,
<br> either the punishment or the hour;
 then they  shall know who is in more evil plight and weaker in forces<br>
<a name = "verse19_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.76</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah increases in guidance those who go aright;
<br> and  ever-abiding good works are with your Lord best in recompense and  best in yielding fruit.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.77</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you,
<br> then,
<br> seen him who disbelieves in Our  communications and says:
<br> I shall certainly be given wealth and  children?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.78</b>]
<br>
<br> Has he gained knowledge of the unseen,
<br> or made a covenant  with the Beneficent God?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.79</b>]
<br>
<br> By no means!
<br> We write down what he says,
 and We will lengthen  to him the length of the chastisement<br>
<a name = "verse19_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And We will inherit of him what he says,
<br> and he shall come to  Us alone.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.81</b>]
<br>
<br> And they have taken gods besides Allah,
<br> that they should be  to them a source of strength;
<br>
<a name = "verse19_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.82</b>]
<br>
<br> By no means!
<br> They shall soon deny their worshipping them,
<br> and  they shall be adversaries to them.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.83</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that We have sent the Shaitans against the  unbelievers,
<br> inciting them by incitement?
<br>
<a name = "verse19_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.84</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore be not in haste against them,
<br> We only number out to  them a number (of days).
<br>
<a name = "verse19_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.85</b>]
<br>
 The day on which We will gather those who guard (against  evil) to the Beneficent God to receive honors<br>
<a name = "verse19_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.86</b>]
<br>
 And We will drive the guilty to hell thirsty<br>
<a name = "verse19_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.87</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall not control intercession,
<br> save he who has made a  covenant with the Beneficent God.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.88</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> The Beneficent God has taken (to Himself) a  son.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.89</b>]
<br>
 Certainly you have made an abominable assertion<br>
<a name = "verse19_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.90</b>]
<br>
<br> The heavens may almost be rent thereat,
<br> and the earth cleave  asunder,
<br> and the mountains fall down in pieces,
<br>
<a name = "verse19_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.91</b>]
<br>
<br> That they ascribe a son to the Beneficent God.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.92</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is not worthy of the Beneficent God that He should  take (to Himself) a son.
<br>
<a name = "verse19_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>19.93</b>]
<br>
