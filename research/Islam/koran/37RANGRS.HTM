<p><h3>Book 37</h3>
<br><h3>The Rangers</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse37_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.1</b>]
<br>
 I swear by those who draw themselves out in ranks<br>
<a name = "verse37_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Then those who drive away with reproof,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Then those who recite,
<br> being mindful,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely your God is One:
<br>
<a name = "verse37_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.5</b>]
<br>
<br> The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between  them,
<br> and Lord of the easts.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have adorned the nearest heaven with an  adornment,
<br> the stars,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And (there is) a safeguard against every rebellious  Shaitan.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.8</b>]
<br>
<br> They cannot listen to the exalted assembly and they are  thrown at from every side,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Being driven off,
<br> and for them is a perpetual  chastisement,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Except him who snatches off but once,
<br> then there follows  him a brightly shining flame.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Then ask them whether they are stronger in creation or  those (others) whom We have created.
<br> Surely We created them  of firm clay.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> you wonder while they mock,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they are reminded,
<br> they mind not,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they see a sign they incite one another to  scoff,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> This is nothing but clear magic:
<br>
<a name = "verse37_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.16</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> when we are dead and have become dust and bones,
<br>  shall we then certainly be raised,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Or our fathers of yore?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Aye!
<br> and you shall be abject.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.19</b>]
<br>
<br> So it shall only be a single cry,
<br> when lo!
<br> they shall  see.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall say:
<br> O woe to us!
<br> this is the day of  requital.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.21</b>]
<br>
<br> This is the day of the judgment which you called a lie.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Gather together those who were unjust and their  associates,
 and what they used to worship<br>
<a name = "verse37_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Besides Allah,
<br> then lead them to the way to hell.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And stop them,
<br> for they shall be questioned:
<br>
<a name = "verse37_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.25</b>]
<br>
<br> What is the matter with you that you do not help each  other?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> on that day they shall be submissive.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And some of them shall advance towards others,
<br>  questioning each other.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.28</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> Surely you used to come to us from the  right side.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.29</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> Nay,
<br> you (yourselves) were not  believers;
<br>
<a name = "verse37_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And we had no authority over you,
<br> but you were an  inordinate people;
<br>
<a name = "verse37_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.31</b>]
<br>
<br> So the sentence of our Lord has come to pass against us:
<br>  (now) we shall surely taste;
<br>
<a name = "verse37_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.32</b>]
<br>
<br> So we led you astray,
<br> for we ourselves were erring.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.33</b>]
<br>
<br> So they shall on that day be sharers in the chastisement  one with another.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely thus do We deal with the guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they used to behave proudly when it was said to  them:
<br> There is no god but Allah;
<br>
<a name = "verse37_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And to say:
<br> What!
<br> shall we indeed give up our gods for  the sake of a mad poet?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay:
<br> he has come with the truth and verified the  apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely you will taste the painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And you shall not be rewarded except (for) what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Save the servants of Allah,
<br> the purified ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.41</b>]
<br>
<br> For them is a known sustenance,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Fruits,
<br> and they shall be highly honored,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.43</b>]
<br>
<br> In gardens of pleasure,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.44</b>]
<br>
<br> On thrones,
<br> facing each other.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.45</b>]
<br>
<br> A bowl shall be made to go round them from water running  out of springs,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.46</b>]
<br>
<br> White,
<br> delicious to those who drink.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.47</b>]
<br>
<br> There shall be no trouble in it,
<br> nor shall they be  exhausted therewith.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And with them shall be those who restrain the eyes,
<br>  having beautiful eyes;
<br>
<a name = "verse37_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.49</b>]
<br>
<br> As if they were eggs carefully protected.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Then shall some of them advance to others,
<br> questioning  each other.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.51</b>]
<br>
<br> A speaker from among them shall say:
<br> Surely I had a  comrade of mine,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Who said:
<br> What!
<br> are you indeed of those who accept (the  truth)?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.53</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> when we are dead and have become dust and bones,
<br>  shall we then be certainly brought to judgment?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.54</b>]
<br>
<br> He shall say:
<br> Will you look on?
  <br>
<a name = "verse37_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.55</b>]
<br>
<br>  Then he looked down and saw him in the midst of hell.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.56</b>]
<br>
<br> He shall say:
<br> By Allah!
<br> you had almost caused me to  perish;
<br>
<a name = "verse37_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And had it not been for the favor of my Lord,
<br> I would  certainly have been among those brought up.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.58</b>]
<br>
<br> Is it then that we are not going to die,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Except our previous death?
<br> And we shall not be  chastised?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely this is the mighty achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.61</b>]
<br>
<br> For the like of this then let the workers work.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.62</b>]
<br>
<br> Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of  Zaqqum?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have made it to be a trial to the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely it is a tree that-grows in the bottom of the  hell;
<br>
<a name = "verse37_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Its produce is as it were the heads of the serpents.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Then most surely they shall eat of it and fill (their)  bellies with it.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.67</b>]
<br>
<br> Then most surely they shall have after it to drink of a  mixture prepared in boiling water.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.68</b>]
<br>
<br> Then most surely their return shall be to hell.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they found their fathers going astray,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.70</b>]
<br>
<br> So in their footsteps they are being hastened on.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly most of the ancients went astray before  them,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent among them warners.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.73</b>]
<br>
<br> Then see how was the end of those warned,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.74</b>]
<br>
<br> Except the servants of Allah,
<br> the purified ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.75</b>]
<br>
<br> And Nuh did certainly call upon Us,
<br> and most excellent  answerer of prayer are We.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.76</b>]
<br>
<br> And We delivered him and his followers from the mighty  distress.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.77</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made his offspring the survivors.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later  generations.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.79</b>]
<br>
<br> Peace and salutation to Nuh among the nations.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.80</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus do We surely reward the doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely he was of Our believing servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.82</b>]
<br>
 Then We drowned the others<br>
<a name = "verse37_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.83</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely Ibrahim followed his way.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.84</b>]
<br>
<br> When he came to his Lord with a free heart,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.85</b>]
<br>
<br> When he said to his father and his people:
<br> What is it  that you worship?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.86</b>]
<br>
<br> A lie-- gods besides Allah-- do you desire?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.87</b>]
<br>
<br> What is then your idea about the Lord of the worlds?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.88</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he looked at the stars,
<br> looking up once,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.89</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he said:
<br> Surely I am sick (of your worshipping  these).
<br>
<a name = "verse37_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.90</b>]
<br>
<br> So they went away from him,
<br> turning back.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.91</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he turned aside to their gods secretly and said:
<br>  What!
<br> do you not eat?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.92</b>]
<br>
<br> What is the matter with you that you do not speak?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.93</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he turned against them secretly,
<br> smiting them with  the right hand.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.94</b>]
<br>
<br> So they (people) advanced towards him,
<br> hastening.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.95</b>]
<br>
<br> Said he:
<br> What!
<br> do you worship what you hew out?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.96</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has created you and what you make.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.97</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Build for him a furnace,
<br> then cast him into  the burning fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.98</b>]
<br>
<br> And they desired a war against him,
<br> but We brought them  low.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.99</b>]
<br>
<br> And he said:
<br> Surely I fly to my lord;
<br> He will guide me.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.100</b>]
<br>
<br> My Lord!
<br> grant me of the doers of good deeds.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.101</b>]
<br>
<br> So We gave him the good news of a boy,
<br> possessing  forbearance.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.102</b>]
<br>
<br> And when he attained to working with him,
<br> he said:
<br> O my  son!
<br> surely I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice  you;
<br> consider then what you see.
<br> He said:
<br> O my father!
<br> do  what you are commanded;
<br> if Allah please,
<br> you will find me of  the patient ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.103</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they both submitted and he threw him down upon  his forehead,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.104</b>]
<br>
<br> And We called out to him saying:
<br> O Ibrahim!
<br>
<a name = "verse37_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.105</b>]
<br>
<br> You have indeed shown the truth of the vision;
<br> surely  thus do We reward the doers of good:
<br>
<a name = "verse37_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.106</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely this is a manifest trial.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.107</b>]
<br>
<br> And We ransomed him with a Feat sacrifice.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.108</b>]
<br>
<br> And We perpetuated (praise) to him among the later  generations.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.109</b>]
<br>
<br> Peace be on Ibrahim.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.110</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus do We reward the doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.111</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely he was one of Our believing servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_112"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.112</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave him the good news of Ishaq,
<br> a prophet among  the good ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_113"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.113</b>]
<br>
<br> And We showered Our blessings on him and on Ishaq;
<br> and  of their offspring are the doers of good,
<br> and (also) those  who are clearly unjust to their own souls.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_114"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.114</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We conferred a favor on Musa and Haroun.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_115"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.115</b>]
<br>
<br> And We delivered them both and their people from the  mighty distress.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_116"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.116</b>]
<br>
<br> And We helped them,
<br> so they were the vanquishers.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_117"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.117</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave them both the Book that made (things)  clear.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_118"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.118</b>]
<br>
<br> And We guided them both on the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_119"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.119</b>]
<br>
<br> And We perpetuated (praise) to them among the later  generations.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_120"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.120</b>]
<br>
<br> Peace be on Musa and Haroun.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_121"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.121</b>]
<br>
<br> Even thus do We reward the doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_122"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.122</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they were both of Our believing servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_123"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.123</b>]
<br>
<br> And Ilyas was most surely of the apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_124"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.124</b>]
<br>
<br> When he said to his people:
<br> Do you not guard (against  evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_125"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.125</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do you call upon Ba'l and forsake the best of the  creators,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_126"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.126</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah,
<br> your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_127"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.127</b>]
<br>
<br> But they called him a liar,
<br> therefore they shall most  surely be brought up.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_128"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.128</b>]
<br>
<br> But not the servants of Allah,
<br> the purified ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_129"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.129</b>]
<br>
<br> And We perpetuated to him (praise) among the later  generations.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_130"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.130</b>]
<br>
<br> Peace be on Ilyas.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_131"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.131</b>]
<br>
<br> Even thus do We reward the doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_132"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.132</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely he was one of Our believing servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_133"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.133</b>]
<br>
<br> And Lut was most surely of the apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_134"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.134</b>]
<br>
<br> When We delivered him and his followers,
 all--<br>
<a name = "verse37_135"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.135</b>]
<br>
<br> Except an old woman (who was) amongst those who  tarried.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_136"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.136</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We destroyed the others.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_137"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.137</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely you pass by them in the morning,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_138"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.138</b>]
<br>
<br> And at night;
<br> do you not then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_139"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.139</b>]
<br>
<br> And Yunus was most surely of the apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_140"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.140</b>]
<br>
<br> When he ran away to a ship completely laden,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_141"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.141</b>]
<br>
<br> So he shared (with them),
<br> but was of those who are cast  off.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_142"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.142</b>]
<br>
 So the fish swallowed him while he did that for which  he blamed himself<br>
<a name = "verse37_143"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.143</b>]
<br>
<br> But had it not been that he was of those who glorify  (Us),
<br>
<a name = "verse37_144"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.144</b>]
<br>
<br> He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day  when they are raised.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_145"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.145</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We cast him on to the vacant surface of the earth  while he was sick.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_146"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.146</b>]
<br>
<br> And We caused to grow up for him a gourdplant.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_147"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.147</b>]
<br>
<br> And We sent him to a hundred thousand,
<br> rather they  exceeded.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_148"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.148</b>]
<br>
<br> And they believed,
<br> so We gave them provision till a  time.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_149"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.149</b>]
<br>
<br> Then ask them whether your Lord has daughters and they  have sons.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_150"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.150</b>]
<br>
<br> Or did We create the angels females while they were  witnesses?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_151"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.151</b>]
<br>
<br> Now surely it is of their own lie that they say:
<br>
<a name = "verse37_152"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.152</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has begotten;
<br> and most surely they are liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_153"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.153</b>]
<br>
<br> Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_154"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.154</b>]
<br>
<br> What is the matter with you,
<br> how is it that you judge?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_155"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.155</b>]
<br>
<br> Will you not then mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_156"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.156</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have you a clear authority?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_157"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.157</b>]
<br>
<br> Then bring your book,
<br> if you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_158"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.158</b>]
<br>
<br> And they assert a relationship between Him and the  jinn;
<br> and certainly the jinn do know that they shall surely  be brought up;
<br>
<a name = "verse37_159"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.159</b>]
<br>
<br> Glory be to Allah (for freedom) from what they  describe;
<br>
<a name = "verse37_160"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.160</b>]
<br>
<br> But not so the servants of Allah,
<br> the purified ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_161"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.161</b>]
<br>
<br> So surely you and what you worship,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_162"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.162</b>]
<br>
<br> Not against Him can you cause (any) to fall into trial,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_163"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.163</b>]
<br>
<br> Save him who will go to hell.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_164"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.164</b>]
<br>
<br> And there is none of us but has an assigned place,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_165"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.165</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely we are they who draw themselves out in  ranks,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_166"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.166</b>]
<br>
<br> And we are most surely they who declare the glory (of  Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse37_167"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.167</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely they used to say:
<br>
<a name = "verse37_168"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.168</b>]
<br>
<br> Had we a reminder from those of yore,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_169"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.169</b>]
<br>
<br> We would certainly have been the servants of Allah-- the  purified ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_170"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.170</b>]
<br>
<br> But (now) they disbelieve in it,
<br> so they will come to  know.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_171"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.171</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly Our word has already gone forth in  respect of Our servants,
<br> the apostles:
<br>
<a name = "verse37_172"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.172</b>]
<br>
 Most surely they shall be the assisted ones<br>
<a name = "verse37_173"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.173</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious  ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_174"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.174</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore turn away from them till a time,
<br>
<a name = "verse37_175"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.175</b>]
<br>
<br> And (then) see them,
<br> so they too shall see.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_176"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.176</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> would they then hasten on Our chastisement?
<br>
<a name = "verse37_177"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.177</b>]
<br>
<br> But when it shall descend in their court,
<br> evil shall  then be the morning of the warned ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_178"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.178</b>]
<br>
 And turn away from them till a time<br>
<a name = "verse37_179"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.179</b>]
<br>
<br> And (then) see,
<br> for they too shall see.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_180"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.180</b>]
<br>
<br> Glory be to your Lord,
<br> the Lord of Honor,
<br> above what  they describe.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_181"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.181</b>]
<br>
<br> And peace be on the apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse37_182"></a>
<p>
[<b>37.182</b>]
<br>
<br> And all praise is due to Allah,
<br> the Lord of the worlds.
