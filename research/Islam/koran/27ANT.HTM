<p><h3>Book 27</h3>
<br><h3>The Ant</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse27_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ta Sin!
 These are the verses of the Quran and the Book  that makes (things) clear<br>
<a name = "verse27_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.2</b>]
<br>
<br> A guidance and good news for the believers,
<br>
<a name = "verse27_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Who keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate,
<br> and of the  hereafter,
<br> they are sure.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.4</b>]
<br>
<br> As to those who do not believe in the hereafter,
<br> We have  surely made their deeds fair-seeming to them,
<br> but they  blindly wander on.
  <br>
<a name = "verse27_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  These are they who shall have an evil punishment,
<br> and in  the hereafter they shall be the greatest losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely you are made to receive the Quran from  the Wise,
<br> the Knowing God.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.7</b>]
<br>
<br> When Musa said to his family:
<br> Surely I see fire;
<br> I will  bring to you from it some news,
<br> or I will bring to you  therefrom a burning firebrand so that you may warm  yourselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.8</b>]
<br>
<br> So when he came to it a voice was uttered saying:
<br> Blessed  is Whoever is in the fire and whatever is about it;
<br> and  glory be to Allah,
<br> the Lord of the worlds;
<br>
<a name = "verse27_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.9</b>]
<br>
<br> O Musa!
<br> surely I am Allah,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the Wise;
<br>
<a name = "verse27_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And cast down your staff.
<br> So when he saw it in motion as  if it were a serpent,
<br> he turned back retreating and did not  return:
<br> O Musa!
<br> fear not;
<br> surely the apostles shall not fear  in My presence;
<br>
<a name = "verse27_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Neither he who has been unjust,
<br> then he does good  instead after evil,
<br> for surely I am the Forgiving,
<br> the  Merciful:
<br>
<a name = "verse27_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And enter your hand into the opening of your bosom,
<br> it  shall come forth white without evil;
<br> among nine signs to  Firon and his people,
<br> surely they are a transgressing  people.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.13</b>]
<br>
<br> So when Our clear signs came to them,
<br> they said:
<br> This is  clear enchantment.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And they denied them unjustly and proudly while their  soul had been convinced of them;
<br> consider,
<br> then how was the  end of the mischief-makers.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave knowledge to Dawood and Sulaiman,
<br>  and they both said:
<br> Praise be to Allah,
<br> Who has made us to  excel many of His believing servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And Sulaiman was Dawood's heir,
<br> and he said:
<br> O men!
<br> we  have been taught the language of birds,
<br> and we have been  given all things;
<br> most surely this is manifest grace.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And his hosts of the jinn and the men and the birds were  gathered to him,
<br> and they were formed into groups.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when they came to the valley of the Naml,
<br> a  Namlite said:
<br> O Naml!
<br> enter your houses,
<br> (that) Sulaiman and  his hosts may not crush you while they do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.19</b>]
<br>
<br> So he smiled,
<br> wondering at her word,
<br> and said:
<br> My Lord!
<br>  grant me that I should be grateful for Thy favor which Thou  hast bestowed on me and on my parents,
<br> and that I should do  good such as Thou art pleased with,
<br> and make me enter,
<br> by  Thy mercy,
<br> into Thy servants,
<br> the good ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And he reviewed the birds,
<br> then said:
<br> How is it I see  not the hoopoe or is it that he is of the absentees?
<br>
<a name = "verse27_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.21</b>]
<br>
<br> 1 will most certainly punish him with a severe  punishment,
<br> or kill him,
<br> or he shall bring to me a clear  plea.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And he tarried not long,
<br> then said:
<br> I comprehend that  which you do not comprehend and I have brought to you a sure  information from Sheba.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I found a woman ruling over them,
<br> and she has  been given abundance and she has a mighty throne:
<br>
<a name = "verse27_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.24</b>]
<br>
<br> 1 found her and her people adoring the sun instead of  Allah,
<br> and the Shaitan has made their deeds fair-seeming to  them and thus turned them from the way,
 so they do not go  aright<br>
<a name = "verse27_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.25</b>]
<br>
<br> That they do not make obeisance to Allah,
<br> Who brings  forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows  what you hide and what you make manifest:
<br>
<a name = "verse27_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah,
<br> there is no god but He:
<br> He is the Lord of mighty  power.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.27</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> We will see whether you have told the truth or  whether you are of the liars:
<br>
<a name = "verse27_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Take this my letter and hand it over to them,
<br> then turn  away from them and see what (answer) they return.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.29</b>]
<br>
<br> She said:
<br> O chief!
 surely an honorable letter has been  delivered to me<br>
<a name = "verse27_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely it is from Sulaiman,
<br> and surely it is in the name  of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful;
<br>
<a name = "verse27_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Saying:
<br> exalt not yourselves against me and come to me  in submission.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.32</b>]
<br>
<br> She said:
<br> O chiefs!
<br> give me advice respecting my affair:
<br>  I never decide an affair until you are in my presence.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.33</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We are possessors of strength and possessors  of mighty prowess,
<br> and the command is yours,
<br> therefore see  what you will command.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.34</b>]
<br>
<br> She said:
<br> Surely the kings,
<br> when they enter a town,
<br> ruin  it and make the noblest of its people to be low,
<br> and thus  they (always) do;
<br>
<a name = "verse27_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely I am going to send a present to them,
<br> and  shall wait to see what (answer) do the messengers bring  back.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.36</b>]
<br>
<br> So when he came to Sulaiman,
<br> he said:
<br> What!
<br> will you  help me with wealth?
<br> But what Allah has given me is better  than what He has given you.
<br> Nay,
<br> you are exultant because of  your present;
<br>
<a name = "verse27_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Go back to them,
<br> so we will most certainly come to them  with hosts which they shall have no power to oppose,
<br> and we  will most certainly expel them therefrom in abasement,
<br> and  they shall be in a state of ignominy.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.38</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O chiefs!
<br> which of you can bring to me her  throne before they come to me in submission?
<br>
<a name = "verse27_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.39</b>]
<br>
<br> One audacious among the jinn said:
<br> I will bring it to  you before you rise up from your place;
<br> and most surely I am  strong (and) trusty for it.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.40</b>]
<br>
<br> One who had the knowledge of the Book said:
<br> I will bring  it to you in the twinkling of an eye.
<br> Then when he saw it  settled beside him,
<br> he said:
<br> This is of the grace of my Lord  that He may try me whether I am grateful or ungrateful;
<br> and  whoever is grateful,
<br> he is grateful only for his own soul,
<br>  and whoever is ungrateful,
<br> then surely my Lord is  Self-sufficient,
<br> Honored.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.41</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Alter her throne for her,
<br> we will see whether  she follows the right way or is of those who do not go  aright.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.42</b>]
<br>
<br> So when she came,
<br> it was said:
<br> Is your throne like this?
<br>  She said:
<br> It is as it were the same,
<br> and we were given the  knowledge before it,
<br> and we were submissive.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And what she worshipped besides Allah prevented her,
<br>  surely she was of an unbelieving people.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.44</b>]
<br>
<br> It was said to her:
<br> Enter the palace;
<br> but when she saw  it she deemed it to be a great expanse of water,
<br> and bared  her legs.
<br> He said:
<br> Surely it is a palace made smooth with  glass.
<br> She said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> surely I have been unjust to  myself,
<br> and I submit with Sulaiman to Allah,
<br> the Lord of the  worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent to Samood their brother Salih,
<br>  saying:
<br> Serve Allah;
<br> and lo!
<br> they became two sects  quarrelling with each other.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.46</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my people!
<br> why do you seek to hasten on the  evil before the good?
<br> Why do you not ask forgiveness of  Allah so that you may be dealt with mercifully?
<br>
<a name = "verse27_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.47</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We have met with ill luck on account of you  and on account of those with you.
<br> He said:
<br> The cause of your  evil fortune is with Allah;
<br> nay,
<br> you are a people who are  tried.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And there were in the city nine persons who made  mischief in the land and did not act aright.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.49</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Swear to each other by Allah that we will  certainly make a sudden attack on him and his family by  night,
<br> then we will say to his heir:
<br> We did not witness the  destruction of his family,
<br> and we are most surely truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And they planned a plan,
<br> and We planned a plan while  they perceived not.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.51</b>]
<br>
<br> See,
<br> then,
<br> how was the end of their plan that We  destroyed them and their people,
<br> all (of them).
<br>
<a name = "verse27_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.52</b>]
<br>
<br> So those are their houses fallen down because they were  unjust,
<br> most surely there is a sign in this for a people who  know.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.53</b>]
<br>
<br> .
<br>And We delivered those who believed and who guarded  (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse27_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And (We sent) Lut,
<br> when he said to his people:
<br> What!
<br> do  you commit indecency while you see?
<br>
<a name = "verse27_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.55</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do you indeed approach men lustfully rather than  women?
<br> Nay,
<br> you are a people who act ignorantly.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.56</b>]
<br>
<br> But the answer of his people was no other except that  they s said:
<br> Turn out Lut's followers from your town;
<br>  surely they are a people who would keep pure!
<br>
<a name = "verse27_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.57</b>]
<br>
<br> But We delivered him and his followers except his wife;
<br>  We ordained her to be of those who remained behind.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And We rained on them a rain,
<br> and evil was the rain of  those who had been warned.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Praise be to Allah and peace on His servants whom  He has chosen:
<br> is Allah better,
<br> or what they associate (with  Him)?
<br>
<a name = "verse27_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> He Who created the heavens and the earth,
<br> and sent  down for you water from the cloud;
<br> then We cause to grow  thereby beautiful gardens;
<br> it is not possible for you that  you should make the trees thereof to grow.
<br> Is there a god  with Allah?
<br> Nay!
<br> they are people who deviate.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.61</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> Who made the earth a restingplace,
<br> and made in it  rivers,
<br> and raised on it mountains and placed between the  two seas a barrier.
<br> Is there a god with Allah?
<br> Nay!
<br> most of  them do not know!
<br>
<a name = "verse27_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.62</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> Who answers the distressed one when he calls upon  Him and removes the evil,
<br> and He will make you successors in  the earth.
<br> Is there a god with Allah?
<br> Little is it that you  mind!
<br>
<a name = "verse27_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> Who guides you in utter darkness of the land and the  sea,
<br> and Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy.
<br>  Is there a god with Allah?
<br> Exalted by Allah above what they  associate (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse27_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> Who originates the creation,
<br> then reproduces it and  Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth.
<br> Is  there a god With Allah?
<br> Say:
<br> Bring your proof if you are  truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> No one in the heavens and the earth knows the  unseen but Allah;
<br> and they do not know when they shall be  raised.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> their knowledge respecting the hereafter is slight  and hasty;
<br> nay,
<br> they are in doubt about it;
<br> nay,
 they are  quite blind to<br>
<a name = "verse27_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> What!
<br> when we have become  dust and our fathers (too),
<br> shall we certainly be brought  forth?
<br>
<a name = "verse27_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.68</b>]
<br>
<br> We have certainly been promised this,
<br> we and our fathers  before;
 these are naught but stories of the ancients<br>
<a name = "verse27_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Travel in the earth,
<br> then see how was the end of  the guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.70</b>]
<br>
<br> And grieve not for them and be not distressed because of  what they plan.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> When will this threat come to pass,
<br> if you  are truthful?
<br>
<a name = "verse27_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.72</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Maybe there may have drawn near to you somewhat of  that which you seek to hasten on.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely your Lord is the Lord of grace to men,
<br> but  most of them are not grateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely your Lord knows what their breasts  conceal and what they manifest.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.75</b>]
<br>
<br> And there is nothing concealed in the heaven and the  earth but it is in a clear book.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.76</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely this Quran declares to the children of Israel  most of what they differ in.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.77</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely it is a guidance and a mercy for the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.78</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely your Lord will judge between them by his  judgment,
<br> and He is the Mighty,
<br> the knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.79</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore rely on Allah;
<br> surely you are on the clear  truth.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.80</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely you do not make the dead to hear,
<br> and you do not  make the deaf to hear the call when they go back retreating.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor can you be a guide to the blind out of their error;
<br>  you cannot make to bear (any one) except those who believe  in Our communications,
<br> so they submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the word shall come to pass against them,
<br> We  shall bring forth for them a creature from the earth that  shall i wound them,
<br> because people did not believe in Our  communications.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.83</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when We will gather from every nation a  party from among those who rejected Our communications,
<br>  then they shall be formed into groups.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>27.84</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when they come,
<br> He will say:
<br> Did you reject My  communications while you had no comprehensive knowledge of  them?

<br> And the word shall come to pass against them because  they were unjust,

<br> Do they not consider that We have made the night that.
<br>  they may rest therein,
<br> and the day to give light?
<br> Most  surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.

<br> And on the day when the trumpet shall be blown,
<br> then  those who are in the heavens and those who are in the earth  shall be terrified except such as Allah please,

<br> And you see the mountains,

<br>  and they shall pass away as the passing away of the  cloud-- the handiwork of Allah Who has made every thing  thoroughly;
<br> surely He is Aware of what you do.

<br> I am commanded only that I should serve the Lord of this  city,

<br> Therefore whoever  goes aright,

<br> I am only one of the warners.
<br>
<a name = "verse27_93"></a>
