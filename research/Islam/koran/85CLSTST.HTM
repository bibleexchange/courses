<p><h3>Book 85</h3>
<br><h3>The Celestial Stations</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse85_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.1</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the mansions of the stars,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And the promised day,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And the bearer of witness and those against whom the  witness is borne.
<br>
<a name = "verse85_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Cursed be the makers of the pit,
  <br>
<a name = "verse85_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Of the fire (kept burning) with fuel,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.6</b>]
<br>
<br> When they sat by it,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And they were witnesses of what they did with the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse85_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And they did not take vengeance on them for aught except  that they believed in Allah,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the Praised,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth;
<br> and  Allah is a Witness of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse85_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who persecute the believing men  and the believing women,
<br> then do not repent,
<br> they shall have  the chastisement of hell,
<br> and they shall have the  chastisement of burning.
<br>
<a name = "verse85_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who believe and do good,
<br> they  shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow,
<br> that is the  great achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse85_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the might of your Lord is great.
<br>
<a name = "verse85_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely He it is Who originates and reproduces,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And He is the Forgiving,
<br> the Loving,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Lord of the Arsh,
<br> the Glorious,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.16</b>]
<br>
<br> The great doer of what He will.
<br>
<a name = "verse85_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Has not there come to you the story of the hosts,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Of Firon and Samood?
<br>
<a name = "verse85_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> those who disbelieve are in (the act of) giving the  lie to the truth.
<br>
<a name = "verse85_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah encompasses them on every side.
<br>
<a name = "verse85_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> it is a glorious Quran,
<br>
<a name = "verse85_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>85.22</b>]
<br>
<br> In a guarded tablet.
