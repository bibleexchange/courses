<p><h3>Book 4</h3>
<br><h3>The Women</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse4_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O people!
<br> be careful of (your duty to) your Lord,
<br> Who created  you from a single being and created its mate of the same (kind) and  spread from these two,
<br> many men and women;
<br> and be careful of  (your duty to) Allah,
<br> by Whom you demand one of another (your  rights),
<br> and (to) the ties of relationship;
<br> surely Allah ever watches  over you.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And give to the orphans their property,
<br> and do not substitute  worthless (things) for (their) good (ones),
<br> and do not devour  their property (as an addition) to your own property;
<br> this is  surely a great crime.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards  orphans,
<br> then marry such women as seem good to you,
<br> two and  three and four;
<br> but if you fear that you will not do justice  (between them),
<br> then (marry) only one or what your right hands  possess;
<br> this is more proper,
<br> that you may not deviate from the  right course.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And give women their dowries as a free gift,
<br> but if they of  themselves be pleased to give up to you a portion of it,
<br> then eat it  with enjoyment and with wholesome result.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  And do not give away your property which Allah has made  for you a (means of) support to the weak of understanding,
<br> and  maintain them out of (the profits of) it,
<br> and clothe them and  speak to them words of honest advice.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And test the orphans until they attain puberty;
<br> then if you  find in them maturity of intellect,
<br> make over to them their  property,
<br> and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily,
<br> lest  they attain to full age;
<br> and whoever is rich,
<br> let him abstain  altogether,
<br> and whoever is poor,
<br> let him eat reasonably;
<br> then  when you make over to them their property,
<br> call witnesses in  their presence;
<br> and Allah is enough as a Reckoner.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Men shall have a portion of what the parents and the near  relatives leave,
<br> and women shall have a portion of what the  parents and the near relatives leave,
<br> whether there is little or  much of it;
<br> a stated portion.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And when there are present at the division the relatives and  the orphans and the needy,
<br> give them (something) out of it and  speak to them kind words.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And let those fear who,
<br> should they leave behind them  weakly offspring,
<br> would fear on their account,
<br> so let them be  careful of (their duty to) Allah,
<br> and let them speak right words.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.10</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who swallow the property of the orphans  unjustly,
<br> surely they only swallow fire into their bellies and they  shall enter burning fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah enjoins you concerning your children:
<br> The male  shall have the equal of the portion of two females;
<br> then if they  are more than two females,
<br> they shall have two-thirds of what  the deceased has left,
<br> and if there is one,
<br> she shall have the half;
<br>  and as for his parents,
<br> each of them shall have the sixth of what  he has left if he has a child,
<br> but if he has no child and (only) his  two parents inherit him,
<br> then his mother shall have the third;
<br> but  if he has brothers,
<br> then his mother shall have the sixth after (the  payment of) a bequest he may have bequeathed or a debt;
<br> your  parents and your children,
<br> you know not which of them is the  nearer to you in usefulness;
<br> this is an ordinance from Allah:
<br>  Surely Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And you shall have half of what your wives leave if they  have no child,
<br> but if they have a child,
<br> then you shall have a  fourth of what they leave after (payment of) any bequest they  may have bequeathed or a debt;
<br> and they shall have the fourth of  what you leave if you have no child,
<br> but if you have a child then  they shall have the eighth of what you leave after (payment of) a  bequest you may have bequeathed or a debt;
<br> and if a man or a  woman leaves property to be inherited by neither parents nor  offspring,
<br> and he (or she) has a brother or a sister,
<br> then each of  them two shall have the sixth,
<br> but if they are more than that,
<br>  they shall be sharers in the third after (payment of) any bequest  that may have been bequeathed or a debt that does not harm  (others);
<br> this is an ordinance from Allah:
<br> and Allah is Knowing,
<br>  Forbearing.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.13</b>]
<br>
<br> These are Allah's limits,
<br> and whoever obeys Allah and His  Apostle,
<br> He will cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers  flow,
<br> to abide in them;
<br> and this is the great achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle and goes  beyond His limits,
<br> He will cause him to enter fire to abide in it,
<br>  and he shall have an abasing chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for those who are guilty of an indecency from  among your women,
<br> call to witnesses against them four (witnesses)  from among you;
<br> then if they bear witness confine them  to the houses until death takes them away or Allah opens some  way for them.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for the two who are guilty of indecency from  among you,
<br> give them both a punishment;
<br> then if they repent  and amend,
<br> turn aside from them;
<br> surely Allah is Oft-returning  (to mercy),
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Repentance with Allah is only for those who do evil in  ignorance,
<br> then turn (to Allah) soon,
<br> so these it is to whom Allah  turns (mercifully),
<br> and Allah is ever Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And repentance is not for those who go on doing evil  deeds,
<br> until when death comes to one of them,
<br> he says:
<br> Surely  now I repent;
<br> nor (for) those who die while they are unbelievers.
<br>  These are they for whom We have prepared a painful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.19</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> it is not lawful for you that you should  take women as heritage against (their) will,
<br> and do not straiten  them m order that you may take part of what you have given  them,
<br> unless they are guilty of manifest indecency,
<br> and treat  them kindly;
<br> then if you hate them,
<br> it may be that you dislike a  thing while Allah has placed abundant good in it.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you wish to have (one) wife in place of another and  you have given one of them a heap of gold,
<br> then take not from it  anything;
<br> would you take it by slandering (her) and (doing her)  manifest wrong?
<br>
<a name = "verse4_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And how can you take it when one of you has already  gone in to the other and they have made with you a firm  covenant?
<br>
<a name = "verse4_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And marry not woman whom your fathers married,
<br> except  what has already passed;
<br> this surely is indecent and hateful,
<br> and  it 15 an evil way.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Forbidden to you are your mothers and your daughters  and your sisters and your paternal aunts and your maternal  aunts and brothers' daughters and sisters' daughters and your  mothers that have suckled you and your foster-sisters and mothers  of your wives and your step-daughters who are in your guardianship,
<br>  (born) of your wives to whom you have gone in,
<br> but if you  have not gone in to them,
<br> there is no blame on you (in marrying  them),
<br> and the wives of your sons who are of your own loins  and that you should have two sisters together,
<br> except what has  already passed;
<br> surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And all married women except those whom your right  hands possess (this is) Allah's ordinance to you,
<br> and lawful for  you are (all women) besides those,
<br> provided that you seek (them)  with your property,
<br> taking (them) in marriage not committing  fornication.
<br> Then as to those whom you profit by,
<br> give them  their dowries as appointed;
<br> and there is no blame on you about  what you mutually agree after what is appointed;
<br> surely Allah is  Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever among you has not within his power ampleness  of means to marry free believing women,
<br> then (he may  marry) of those whom your right hands possess from among  your believing maidens;
<br> and Allah knows best your faith:
<br> you  are (sprung) the one from the other;
<br> so marry them with the  permission of their masters,
<br> and give them their dowries justly,
<br>  they being chaste,
<br> not fornicating,
<br> nor receiving paramours;
<br> and  when they are taken in marriage,
<br> then if they are guilty of indecency,
<br>  they shall suffer half the punishment which is (inflicted)  upon free women.
<br> This is for him among you who fears falling  into evil;
<br> and that you abstain is better for you,
<br> and Allah is  Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah desires to explain to you,
<br> and to guide you into the  ways of those before you,
<br> and to turn to you (mercifully),
<br> and  Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah desires that He should turn to you (mercifully),
<br>  and those who follow (their) lusts desire that you should deviate  (with) a great deviation.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah desires that He should make light your burdens,
<br>  and man is created weak.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.29</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not devour your property among  yourselves falsely,
<br> except that it be trading by your mutual  consent;
<br> and do not kill your people;
<br> surely Allah is Merciful to  you.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever does this aggressively and unjustly,
<br> We will  soon cast him into fire;
<br> and this is easy to Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.31</b>]
<br>
<br> If you shun the great sins which you are forbidden,
<br> We  will do away with your small sins and cause you to enter an  honorable place of entering.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not covet that by which Allah has made some of  you excel others;
<br> men shall have the benefit of what they earn  and women shall have the benefit of what they earn;
<br> and ask  Allah of His grace;
<br> surely Allah knows all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And to every one We have appointed heirs of what parents  and near relatives leave;
<br> and as to those with whom your rights  hands have ratified agreements,
<br> give them their portion;
<br> surely  Allah is a witness over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has  made some of them to excel others and because they spend out  of their property;
<br> the good women are therefore obedient,
<br> guarding  the unseen as Allah has guarded;
<br> and (as to) those on whose  part you fear desertion,
<br> admonish them,
<br> and leave them alone in  the sleeping-places and beat them;
<br> then if they obey you,
<br> do not  seek a way against them;
<br> surely Allah is High,
<br> Great.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you fear a breach between the two,
<br> then appoint  judge from his people and a judge from her people;
<br> if they both  desire agreement,
<br> Allah will effect harmony between them,
<br> surely  Allah is Knowing,
<br> Aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And serve Allah and do not associate any thing with Him  and be good to the parents and to the near of kin and the  orphans and the needy and the neighbor of (your) kin and the  alien neighbor,
<br> and the companion in a journey and the wayfarer  and those whom your right hands possess;
<br> surely Allah does not  love him who is proud,
<br> boastful;
<br>
<a name = "verse4_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who are niggardly and bid people to be niggardly  and hide what Allah has given them out of His grace;
<br> and We  have prepared for the unbelievers a disgraceful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who spend their property (in alms) to be seen  of the people and do not believe in Allah nor in the last day;
<br> and  as for him whose associate is the Shaitan,
<br> an evil associate is  he!
<br>
<a name = "verse4_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And what (harm) would it have done them if they had  believed in Allah and the last day and spent (benevolently) of  what Allah had given them?
<br> And Allah knows them.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah does not do injustice to the weight of an  atom,
<br> and if it is a good deed He multiplies it and gives from  Himself a great reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.41</b>]
<br>
<br> How will it be,
<br> then,
<br> when We bring from every people a  witness and bring you as a witness against these?
<br>
<a name = "verse4_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.42</b>]
<br>
<br> On that day will those who disbelieve and disobey the  Apostle desire that the earth were levelled with them,
<br> and they  shall not hide any word from Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.43</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not go near prayer when you are  Intoxicated until you know (well) what you say,
<br> nor when you are  under an obligation to perform a bath-- unless (you are) travelling  on the road-- until you have washed yourselves;
<br> and if you  are sick,
<br> or on a journey,
<br> or one of you come from the privy or you  have touched the women,
<br> and you cannot find water,
<br> betake  yourselves to pure earth,
<br> then wipe your faces and your hands;
<br>  surely Allah is Pardoning,
<br> Forgiving.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not considered those to whom a portion of the  Book has been given?
<br> They buy error and desire that you should  go astray from the way.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah best knows your enemies;
<br> and Allah suffices as  a Guardian,
<br> and Allah suffices as a Helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Of those who are Jews (there are those who) alter words  from their places and say:
<br> We have heard and we disobey and:
<br>  Hear,
<br> may you not be made to hear!
<br> and:
<br> Raina,
<br> distorting (the  word) with their tongues and taunting about religion;
<br> and if they  had said (instead):
<br> We have heard and we obey,
<br> and hearken,
<br>  and unzurna it would have been better for them and more  upright;
<br> but Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief,
<br>  so they do not believe but a little.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.47</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who have been given the Book!
<br> believe that which  We have revealed,
<br> verifying what you have,
<br> before We alter faces  then turn them on their backs,
<br> or curse them as We cursed the  violaters of the Sabbath,
<br> and the command of Allah shall be  executed.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah does not forgive that anything should be  associated with Him,
<br> and forgives what is besides that to whomsoever  He pleases;
<br> and whoever associates anything with Allah,
<br>  he devises indeed a great sin.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not considered those who attribute purity to  themselves?
<br> Nay,
<br> Allah purifies whom He pleases;
<br> and they shall  not be wronged the husk of a date stone.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.50</b>]
<br>
<br> See how they forge the lie against Allah,
<br> and this is  sufficient as a manifest sin.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.51</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book  has been given?
<br> They believe in idols and false deities and say of  those who disbelieve:
<br> These are better guided in the path than  those who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Those are they whom Allah has cursed,
<br> and whomever  Allah curses you shall not find any helper for him.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.53</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they a share in the kingdom?
<br> But then they would  not give to people even the speck in the date stone.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them  of His grace?
<br> But indeed We have given to Ibrahim's children the  Book and the wisdom,
<br> and We have given them a grand kingdom.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.55</b>]
<br>
<br> So of them is he who believes in him,
<br> and of them is he  who turns away from him,
<br> and hell is sufficient to burn.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.56</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who disbelieve in Our communications,
<br> We  shall make them enter fire;
<br> so oft as their skins are thoroughly  burned,
<br> We will change them for other skins,
<br> that they may taste  the chastisement;
<br> surely Allah is Mighty,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who believe and do good deeds,
<br> We  will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow,
<br> to abide  in them for ever;
<br> they shall have therein pure mates,
<br> and We  shall make them enter a dense shade.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.58</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah commands you to make over trusts to their  owners and that when you judge between people you judge with  justice;
<br> surely Allah admonishes you with what is excellent;
<br>  surely Allah is Seeing,
<br> Hearing.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.59</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> obey Allah and obey the Apostle and  those in authority from among you;
<br> then if you quarrel about  anything,
<br> refer it to Allah and the Apostle,
<br> if you believe in  Allah and the last day;
<br> this is better and very good in the end.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not seen those who assert that they believe in  what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before  you?
<br> They desire to summon one another to the judgment of the  Shaitan,
<br> though they were commanded to deny him,
<br> and the  Shaitan desires to lead them astray into a remote error.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them:
<br> Come to what Allah has  revealed and to the Apostle,
<br> you will see the hypocrites turning  away from you with (utter) aversion.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.62</b>]
<br>
<br> But how will it be when misfortune befalls them on account  of what their hands have sent before?
<br> Then they will come  to you swearing by Allah:
<br> We did not desire (anything) but good  and concord.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>4.63</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they of whom Allah knows what is in their  hearts;
<br> therefore turn aside from them and admonish them,
<br> and  speak to them effectual words concerning themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse4_64"></a>
<p>
