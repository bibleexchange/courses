<p><h3>Book 74</h3>
<br><h3>The Covered One</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse74_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who are clothed!
<br>
<a name = "verse74_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Arise and warn,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord do magnify,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And your garments do purify,
  <br>
<a name = "verse74_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  And uncleanness do shun,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And bestow not favors that you may receive again with  increase,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And for the sake of your Lord,
<br> be patient.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.8</b>]
<br>
<br> For when the trumpet is sounded,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.9</b>]
<br>
<br> That,
<br> at that time,
<br> shall be a difficult day,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.10</b>]
<br>
<br> For the unbelievers,
<br> anything but easy.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Leave Me and him whom I created alone,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And give him vast riches,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And sons dwelling in his presence,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And I adjusted affairs for him adjustably;
<br>
<a name = "verse74_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And yet he desires that I should add more!
<br>
<a name = "verse74_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.16</b>]
<br>
<br> By no means!
<br> surely he offers opposition to Our  communications.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.17</b>]
<br>
<br> 1 will make a distressing punishment overtake him.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely he reflected and guessed,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.19</b>]
<br>
<br> But may he be cursed how he plotted;
<br>
<a name = "verse74_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Again,
<br> may he be cursed how he plotted;
<br>
<a name = "verse74_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he looked,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he frowned and scowled,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he turned back and was big with pride,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he said:
<br> This is naught but enchantment,
<br> narrated  (from others);
<br>
<a name = "verse74_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.25</b>]
<br>
<br> This is naught but the word of a mortal.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.26</b>]
<br>
<br> 1 will cast him into hell.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And what will make you realize what hell is?
<br>
<a name = "verse74_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.28</b>]
<br>
<br> It leaves naught nor does it spare aught.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.29</b>]
<br>
<br> It scorches the mortal.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Over it are nineteen.
<br>    31 .
<br> And We have not made the wardens of the fire others  than angels,
<br> and We have not made their number but as a  trial for those who disbelieve,
<br> that those who have been  given the book may be certain and those who believe may  increase in faith,
<br> and those who have been given the book  and the believers may not doubt,
<br> and that those in whose  hearts is a disease and the unbelievers may say:
<br> What does  Allah mean by this parable?
<br> Thus does Allah make err whom He  pleases,
<br> and He guides whom He pleases,
<br> and none knows the  hosts of your Lord but He Himself;
<br> and this is naught but a  reminder to the mortals.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay;
<br> I swear by the moon,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And the night when it departs,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And the daybreak when it shines;
<br>
<a name = "verse74_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely it (hell) is one of the gravest (misfortunes),
<br>
<a name = "verse74_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.36</b>]
<br>
<br> A warning to mortals,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.37</b>]
<br>
<br> To him among you who wishes to go forward or remain  behind.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Every soul is held in pledge for what it earns,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Except the people of the right hand,
<br>
<a name = "verse74_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.40</b>]
<br>
<br> In gardens,
 they shall ask each other<br>
<a name = "verse74_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.41</b>]
<br>
<br> About the guilty:
<br>
<a name = "verse74_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.42</b>]
<br>
<br> What has brought you into hell?
<br>
<a name = "verse74_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.43</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> We were not of those who prayed;
<br>
<a name = "verse74_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And we used not to feed the poor;
<br>
<a name = "verse74_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who  entered into vain discourses.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And we used to call the day of judgment a lie;
<br>
<a name = "verse74_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Till death overtook us.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.48</b>]
<br>
<br> So the intercession of intercessors shall not avail  them.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.49</b>]
<br>
<br> What is then the matter with them,
 that they turn away  from the admonition<br>
<a name = "verse74_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.50</b>]
<br>
 As if they were asses taking fright<br>
<a name = "verse74_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.51</b>]
<br>
<br> That had fled from a lion?
<br>
<a name = "verse74_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay;
<br> every one of them desires that he may be given  pages spread out;
<br>
<a name = "verse74_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.53</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> but they do not fear the hereafter.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> it is surely an admonition.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.55</b>]
<br>
<br>  So whoever pleases may mind it.
<br>
<a name = "verse74_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>74.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And they will not mind unless Allah please.
<br> He is worthy  to be feared and worthy to forgive.
