<p><h3>Book 64</h3>
<br><h3>The Mutual Deceit</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse64_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth  declares the glory of Allah;
<br> to Him belongs the kingdom,
<br> and  to Him is due (all) praise,
<br> and He has power over all  things.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.2</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who created you,
<br> but one of you is an unbeliever  and another of you is a believer;
<br> and Allah sees what you  do.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.3</b>]
<br>
<br> He created the heavens and the earth with truth,
<br> and He  formed you,
<br> then made goodly your forms,
<br> and to Him is the  ultimate resort.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.4</b>]
<br>
<br> He knows what is in the heavens and the earth,
<br> and He  knows what you hide and what you manifest;
<br>and Allah is  Cognizant of what is in the hearts.
  <br>
<a name = "verse64_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Has there not come to you the story of those who  disbelieved before,
<br> then tasted the evil result of their  conduct,
<br> and they had a painful punishment?
<br>
<a name = "verse64_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.6</b>]
<br>
<br> That is because there came to them their apostles with  clear arguments,
<br> but they said:
<br> Shall mortals guide us?
<br> So  they disbelieved and turned back,
<br> and Allah does not stand  in need (of anything),
<br> and Allah is Self-sufficient,
<br>  Praised.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who disbelieve think that they shall never be  raised.
<br> Say:
<br> Aye!
<br> by my Lord!
<br> you shall most certainly be  raised,
<br> then you shall most certainly be informed of what  you did;
<br> and that is easy to Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore believe in Allah and His Apostle and the Light  which We have revealed;
<br> and Allah is Aware of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.9</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day that He will gather you for the day of  gathering,
<br> that is the day of loss and gain;
<br> and whoever  believes in Allah and does good,
<br> He will remove from him his  evil and cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers  flow,
<br> to abide therein forever;
<br> that is the great  achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who disbelieve and reject Our  communications,
<br> they are the inmates of the fire,
<br> to abide  therein and evil is the resort.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.11</b>]
<br>
<br> No affliction comes about but by Allah's permission;
<br> and  whoever believes in Allah,
<br> He guides aright his heart;
<br> and  Allah is Cognizant of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And obey Allah and obey the Apostle,
<br> but if you turn  back,
<br> then upon Our Apostle devolves only the clear delivery  (of the message).
<br>
<a name = "verse64_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah,
<br> there is no god but He;
<br> and upon Allah,
<br> then,
<br> let  the believers rely.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.14</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> surely from among your wives and your  children there is an enemy to you;
<br> therefore beware of them;
<br>  and if you pardon and forbear and forgive,
<br> then surely Allah  is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Your possessions and your children are only a trial,
<br> and  Allah it is with Whom is a great reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore be careful of (your duty to) Allah as much as  you can,
<br> and hear and obey and spend,
<br> it is better for your  souls;
<br> and whoever is saved from the greediness of his soul,
<br>  these it is that are the successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse64_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.17</b>]
<br>
<br> If you set apart for Allah a goodly portion,
<br> He will  double it for you and forgive you;
<br> and Allah is the  Multiplier (of rewards),
<br> Forbearing,
<br>
<a name = "verse64_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>64.18</b>]
<br>
<br> The Knower of the unseen and the seen,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the  Wise.
