<p><h3>Book 31</h3>
<br><h3>Luqman</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse31_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.2</b>]
<br>
 These are verses of the Book of Wisdom<br>
<a name = "verse31_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.3</b>]
<br>
<br> A guidance and a mercy for the doers of goodness,
<br>
<a name = "verse31_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and they  are certain of the hereafter.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.5</b>]
<br>
<br> These are on a guidance from their Lord,
<br> and these are  they who are successful:
<br>
<a name = "verse31_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And of men is he who takes instead frivolous discourse to  lead astray from Allah's path without knowledge,
<br> and to take  it for a mockery;
<br> these shall have an abasing chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our communications are recited to him,
<br> he turns  back proudly,
<br> as if he had not heard them,
<br> as though in his  ears were a heaviness,
<br> therefore announce to him a painful  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.8</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who believe and do good,
<br> they shall surely  have gardens of bliss,
<br>
<a name = "verse31_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Abiding in them;
<br> the promise of Allah;
<br> (a) true  (promise),
<br> and He is the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.10</b>]
<br>
<br> He created the heavens without pillars as you see them,
<br>  and put mountains upon the earth lest it might convulse with  you,
<br> and He spread in it animals of every kind;
<br> and We sent  down water from the cloud,
<br> then caused to grow therein  (vegetation) of every noble kind.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.11</b>]
<br>
<br> This is Allah's creation,
<br> but show Me what those besides  Him have created.
<br> Nay,
 the unjust are in manifest error<br>
<a name = "verse31_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave wisdom to Luqman,
<br> saying:
<br> Be  grateful to Allah.
<br> And whoever is grateful,
<br> he is on!
<br>y  grateful for his own soul;
<br> and whoever is ungrateful,
<br> then  surely Allah is Self-sufficient,
<br> Praised.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Luqman said to his son while he admonished him:
<br>  O my son!
<br> do not associate aught with Allah;
 most surely  polytheism is a grievous iniquity--<br>
<a name = "verse31_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have enjoined man in respect of his parents-- his  mother bears him with faintings upon faintings and his  weaning takes two years-- saying:
<br> Be grateful to Me and to  both your parents;
<br> to Me is the eventual coming.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they contend with you that you should associate  with Me what you have no knowledge of,
<br> do not obey them,
<br> and  keep company with them in this world kindly,
<br> and follow the  way of him who turns to Me,
<br> then to Me is your return,
 then  will I inform you of what you did--<br>
<a name = "verse31_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.16</b>]
<br>
<br> O my son!
<br> surely if it is the very weight of the grain  of a mustard-seed,
<br> even though it is in (the heart of) rock,
<br>  or (high above) in the heaven or (deep down) in the earth,
<br>  Allah will bring it (to light);
<br> surely Allah is Knower of  subtleties,
<br> Aware;
<br>
<a name = "verse31_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.17</b>]
<br>
<br> O my son!
<br> keep up prayer and enjoin the good and forbid  the evil,
<br> and bear patiently that which befalls you;
<br> surely  these acts require courage;
<br>
<a name = "verse31_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not turn your face away from people in contempt,
<br>  nor go about in the land exulting overmuch;
<br> surely Allah  does not love any self-conceited boaster;
<br>
<a name = "verse31_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And pursue the right course in your going about and  lower your voice;
<br> surely the most hateful of voices is  braying of the asses.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah has made what is in the  heavens and what is in the earth subservient to you,
<br> and  made complete to you His favors outwardly and inwardly?
<br> And  among men is he who disputes in respect of Allah though  having no knowledge nor guidance,
<br> nor a book giving light.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them:
<br> Follow what Allah has  revealed,
<br> they say:
<br> Nay,
<br> we follow that on which we found  our fathers.
<br> What!
<br> though the Shaitan calls them to the  chastisement of the burning fire!
<br>
<a name = "verse31_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever submits himself wholly to Allah and he is  the doer of good (to others),
<br> he indeed has taken hold of  the firmest thing upon which one can lay hold;
<br> and Allah's  is the end of affairs.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever disbelieves,
<br> let not his disbelief grieve  you;
<br> to Us is their return,
<br> then will We inform them of what  they did surely Allah is the Knower of what is in the  breasts.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.24</b>]
<br>
<br> We give them to enjoy a little,
<br> then will We drive them  to a severe chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you ask them who created the heavens and the  earth,
<br> they will certainly say:
<br> Allah.
<br> Say:
<br> (All) praise is  due to Allah;
<br> nay!
<br> most of them do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.26</b>]
<br>
<br> What is in the heavens and the earth is Allah's;
<br> surely  Allah is the Self-sufficient,
<br> the Praised.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And were every tree that is in the earth (made into)  pens and the sea (to supply it with ink),
<br> with seven more  seas to increase it,
<br> the words of Allah would not come to an  end;
<br> surely Allah is Mighty,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Neither your creation nor your raising is anything but  as a single soul;
<br> surely Allah is Hearing,
<br> Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah makes the night to enter into  the day,
<br> and He makes the day to enter into the night,
<br> and  He has made the sun and the moon subservient (to you);
<br> each  pursues its course till an appointed time;
<br> and that Allah is  Aware of what you do?
<br>    3O This is because Allah is the Truth,
<br> and that which they  call upon besides Him is the falsehood,
<br> and that Allah is  the High,
<br> the Great.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that the ships run on in the sea by  Allah's favor that He may show you of His signs?
<br> Most surely  there are signs in this for every patient endurer,
<br> grateful  one.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And when a wave like mountains covers them they call  upon Allah,
<br> being sincere to Him in obedience,
<br> but when He  brings them safe to the land,
<br> some of them follow the middle  course;
<br> and none denies Our signs but every perfidious,
<br>  ungrateful one.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.33</b>]
<br>
<br> O people!
<br> guard against (the punishment of) your Lord  and dread the day when a father shall not make any  satisfaction for his son,
<br> nor shall the child be the maker  of any satisfaction for his father;
<br> surely the promise of  Allah is true,
<br> therefore let not this world's life deceive  you,
<br> nor let the archdeceiver deceive you in respect of  Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse31_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>31.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah is He with Whom is the knowledge of the  hour,
<br> and He sends down the rain and He knows what is in the  wombs;
<br> and no one knows what he shall earn on the morrow;
<br>  and no one knows in what land he shall die;
<br> surely Allah is  Knowing,
<br> Aware.
