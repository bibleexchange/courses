<p><h3>Book 48</h3>
<br><h3>The Victory</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse48_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.1</b>]
<br>
 Surely We have given to you a clear victory<br>
<a name = "verse48_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.2</b>]
<br>
<br> That Allah may forgive your community their past faults  and those to follow and complete His favor to you and keep  you on a right way,
<br>
<a name = "verse48_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And that Allah might help you with a mighty help.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.4</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who sent down tranquillity into the hearts of  the believers that they might have more of faith added to  their faith-- and Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and  the earth,
<br> and Allah is Knowing,
 Wise--  <br>
<a name = "verse48_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  That He may cause the believing men and the believing  women to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide  therein and remove from them their evil;
 and that is a grand  achievement with Allah<br>
<a name = "verse48_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And (that) He may punish the hypocritical men and the  hypocritical women,
<br> and the polytheistic men and the  polytheistic women,
<br> the entertainers of evil thoughts about  Allah.
<br> On them is the evil turn,
<br> and Allah is wroth with  them and has cursed them and prepared hell for them,
<br> and  evil is the resort.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's are the hosts of the heavens and the earth;
<br>  and Allah is Mighty,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have sent you as a witness and as a bearer of  good news and as a warner,
<br>
<a name = "verse48_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.9</b>]
<br>
<br> That you may believe in Allah and His Apostle and may aid  him and revere him;
<br> and (that) you may declare His glory,
<br>  morning and evening.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who swear allegiance to you do but swear  allegiance to Allah;
<br> the hand of Allah is above their hands.
<br>  Therefore whoever breaks (his faith),
<br> he breaks it only to  the injury of his own soul,
<br> and whoever fulfills what he has  covenanted with Allah,
<br> He will grant him a mighty reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind  will say to you:
<br> Our property and our families kept us busy,
<br>  so ask forgiveness for us.
<br> They say with their tongues what  is not in their hearts.
<br> Say:
<br> Then who can control anything  for you from Allah if He intends to do you harm or if He  intends to do you good;
<br> nay,
<br> Allah is Aware of what you do:
<br>
<a name = "verse48_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> you rather thought that the Apostle and the  believers would not return to their families ever,
<br> and that  was made fairseeming to your hearts and you thought an evil  thought and you were a people doomed to perish.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Apostle,
<br>  then surely We have prepared burning fire for the  unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's is the kingdom.
<br> of the heavens and the  earth;
<br> He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He  pleases,
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who are left behind will say when you set forth  for the gaining of acquisitions:
<br> Allow us (that) we may  follow you.
<br> They desire to change the world of Allah.
<br> Say:
<br>  By no means shall you follow us;
<br> thus did Allah say before.
<br>  But they will say:
<br> Nay!
<br> you are jealous of us.
<br> Nay!
<br> they do  not understand but a little.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Say to those of the dwellers of the desert who were left  behind:
<br> You shall soon be invited (to fight) against a  people possessing mighty prowess;
<br> you will fight against  them until they submit;
<br> then if you obey,
<br> Allah will grant  you a good reward;
<br> and if you turn back as you turned back  before,
<br> He will punish you with a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.17</b>]
<br>
<br> There is no harm in the blind,
<br> nor is there any harm in  the lame,
<br> nor is there any harm in the sick (if they do not  go forth);
<br> and whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle,
<br> He will  cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow,
<br> and  whoever turns back,
<br> He will punish him with a painful  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly Allah was well pleased with the believers when  they swore allegiance to you under the tree,
<br> and He knew  what was in their hearts,
<br> so He sent down tranquillity on  them and rewarded them with a near victory,
<br>
<a name = "verse48_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And many acquisitions which they will take;
<br> and Allah is  Mighty,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah promised you many acquisitions which you will  take,
<br> then He hastened on this one for you and held back the  hands of men from you,
<br> and that it may be a sign for the  believers and that He may guide you on a right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And others which you have not yet been able to achieve  Allah has surely encompassed them,
<br> and Allah has power over  all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And if those who disbelieve fight with you,
<br> they would  certainly turn (their) backs,
<br> then they would not find any  protector or a helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Such has been the course of Allah that has indeed run  before,
<br> and you shall not find a change in Allah's course.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who held back their hands from you and your  hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had given  you victory over them;
<br> and Allah is Seeing what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.25</b>]
<br>
<br> It is they who disbelieved and turned you away from the  Sacred Mosque and (turned off) the offering withheld from  arriving at its destined place;
<br> and were it not for the  believing men and the believing women,
<br> whom,
<br> not having  known,
<br> you might have trodden down,
<br> and thus something  hateful might have afflicted you on their account without  knowledge-- so that Allah may cause to enter into His mercy  whomsoever He pleases;
<br> had they been widely separated one  from another,
<br> We would surely have punished those who  disbelieved from among them with a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.26</b>]
<br>
<br> When those who disbelieved harbored in their hearts  (feelings of) disdain,
<br> the disdain of (the days of)  ignorance,
<br> but Allah sent down His tranquillity on His  Apostle and on the believers,
<br> and made them keep the word of  guarding (against evil),
<br> and they were entitled to it and  worthy of it;
<br> and Allah is Cognizant of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly Allah had shown to His Apostle the vision with  truth:
<br> you shall most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque,
<br> if  Allah pleases,
<br> in security,
<br> (some) having their heads shaved  and (others) having their hair cut,
<br> you shall not fear,
<br> but  He knows what you do not know,
<br> so He brought about a near  victory before that.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.28</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who sent His Apostle with the guidance and the  true religion that He may make it prevail over all the  religions;
<br> and Allah is enough for a witness.
<br>
<a name = "verse48_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>48.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah,
<br> and those with him are  firm of heart against the unbelievers,
<br> compassionate among  themselves;
<br> you will see them bowing down,
<br> prostrating  themselves,
<br> seeking grace from Allah and pleasure;
<br> their  marks are in their faces because of the effect of  prostration;
<br> that is their description in the Taurat and  their description in the Injeel;
<br> like as seed-produce that  puts forth its sprout,
<br> then strengthens it,
<br> so it becomes  stout and stands firmly on its stem,
<br> delighting the sowers  that He may enrage the unbelievers on account of them;
<br> Allah  has promised those among them who believe and do good,
<br>  forgiveness and a great reward.
