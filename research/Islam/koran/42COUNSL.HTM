<p><h3>Book 42</h3>
<br><h3>The Counsel</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse42_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ha Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Ain Sin Qaf.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus does Allah,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the Wise,
<br> reveal to you,
<br> and  (thus He revealed) to those before you.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.4</b>]
<br>
<br> His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth,
<br>  and He is the High,
<br> the Great.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.5</b>]
<br>
<br> The heavens may almost rend asunder from above them and  the angels sing the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness  for those on earth;
<br> now surely Allah is the Forgiving,
<br> the  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who take guardians besides Him,
<br> Allah  watches over them,
<br> and you have not charge over them.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus have We revealed to you an Arabic Quran,
<br> that  you may warn the mother city and those around it,
<br> and that  you may give warning of the day of gathering together  wherein is no doubt;
<br> a party shall be in the garden and  (another) party in the burning fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And if Allah had pleased He would surely have made them a  single community,
<br> but He makes whom He pleases enter into  His mercy,
<br> and the unjust it is that shall have no guardian  or helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they taken guardians besides Him?
<br> But Allah is  the Guardian,
<br> and He gives life to the dead,
<br> and He has  power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And in whatever thing you disagree,
<br> the judgment thereof  is (in) Allah's (hand);
<br> that is Allah,
<br> my Lord,
<br> on Him do I  rely and to Him do I turn time after time.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.11</b>]
<br>
<br> The Originator of the heavens and the earth;
<br> He made  mates for you from among yourselves,
<br> and mates of the cattle  too,
<br> multiplying you thereby;
<br> nothing like a likeness of  Him;
<br> and He is the Hearing,
<br> the Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.12</b>]
<br>
<br> His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth;
<br> He  makes ample and straitens the means of subsistence for whom  He pleases;
<br> surely He is Cognizant of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.13</b>]
<br>
<br> He has made plain to you of the religion what He  enjoined upon Nuh and that which We have revealed to you and  that which We enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and Isa that  keep to obedience and be not divided therein;
<br> hard to the  unbelievers is that which you call them to;
<br> Allah chooses  for Himself whom He pleases,
<br> and guides to Himself him who  turns (to Him),
<br> frequently.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And they did not become divided until after knowledge  had come to them out of envy among themselves;
<br> and had not a  word gone forth from your Lord till an appointed term,
<br>  certainly judgment would have been given between them;
<br> and  those who were made to inherit the Book after them are most  surely in disquieting doubt concerning it.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.15</b>]
<br>
<br> To this then go on inviting,
<br> and go on steadfastly on  the right way as you are commanded,
<br> and do not follow their  low desires,
<br> and say:
<br> I believe in what Allah has revealed  of the Book,
<br> and I am commanded to do justice between you:
<br>  Allah is our Lord and your Lord;
<br> we shall have our deeds and  you shall have your deeds;
<br> no plea need there be (now)  between us and you:
<br> Allah will gather us together,
<br> and to  Him is the return.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who dispute about Allah after that  obedience has been rendered to Him,
<br> their plea is null with  their Lord,
<br> and upon them is wrath,
<br> and for them is severe  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah it is Who revealed the Book with truth,
<br> and the  balance,
<br> and what shall make you know that haply the hour be  nigh?
<br>
<a name = "verse42_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who do not believe in it would hasten it on,
<br> and  those who believe are in fear from it,
<br> and they know that it  is the truth.
<br> Now most surely those who dispute obstinately  concerning the hour are in a great error.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is Benignant to His servants;
<br> He gives sustenance  to whom He pleases,
<br> and He is the Strong,
<br> the Mighty.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever desires the gain of the hereafter,
<br> We will give  him more of that again;
<br> and whoever desires-- the gain of this  world,
<br> We give him of it,
<br> and in the hereafter he has no  portion.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they associates who have prescribed for them any  religion that Allah does not sanction?
<br> And were it not for  the word of judgment,
<br> decision would have certainly been  given between them;
<br> and surely the unjust shall have a  painful punish ^ment.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.22</b>]
<br>
<br> You will see the unjust fearing on account of what they  have earned,
<br> and it must befall them;
<br> and those who believe  and do good shall be in the meadows of the gardens;
<br> they  shall have what they please with their Lord:
<br> that is the  great grace.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.23</b>]
<br>
<br> That is of which Allah gives the good news to His  servants,
<br> (to) those who believe and do good deeds.
<br> Say:
<br> I  do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near  relatives;
<br> and whoever earns good,
<br> We give him more of good  therein;
<br> surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Grateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they say:
<br> He has forged a lie against Allah?
<br> But  if Allah pleased,
<br> He would seal your heart;
<br> and Allah will  blot out the falsehood and confirm the truth with His words;
<br>  surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants  and pardons the evil deeds and He knows what you do;
<br>
<a name = "verse42_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And He answers those who believe and do good deeds,
<br> and  gives them more out of His grace;
<br> and (as for) the  unbelievers,
<br> they shall have a severe punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And if Allah should amplify the provision for His  servants they would certainly revolt in the earth;
<br> but He  sends it down according to a measure as He pleases;
<br> surely  He is Aware of,
<br> Seeing,
<br> His servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have  despaired,
<br> and He unfolds His mercy;
<br> and He is the Guardian,
<br>  the Praised One.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and  the earth and what He has spread forth in both of them of  living beings;
<br> and when He pleases He is all-powerful to  gather them together.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And whatever affliction befalls you,
<br> it is on account of  what your hands have wrought,
<br> and (yet) He pardons most (of  your faults).
<br>
<a name = "verse42_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And you cannot escape in the earth,
<br> and you shall not  have a guardian or a helper besides Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And among His signs are the ships in the sea like  mountains.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.33</b>]
<br>
<br> If He pleases,
<br> He causes the wind to become still so  that they lie motionless on its back;
<br> most surely there are  signs in this for every patient,
<br> grateful one,
<br>
<a name = "verse42_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Or He may make them founder for what they have earned,
<br>  and (even then) pardon most;
<br>
<a name = "verse42_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And (that) those who dispute about Our communications  may know;
<br> there is no place of refuge for them.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.36</b>]
<br>
<br> So whatever thing you are given,
<br> that is only a  provision of this world's life,
<br> and what is with Allah is  better and more lasting for those who believe and rely on  their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who.
<br> shun the great sins and indecencies,
<br> and  whenever they are angry they forgive.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer,
<br>  and their rule is to take counsel among themselves,
<br> and who  spend out of what We have given them.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who,
<br> when great wrong afflicts them,
<br> defend  themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And the recompense of evil is punishment like it,
<br> but  whoever forgives and amends,
<br> he shall have his reward from  Allah;
<br> surely He does not love the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever defends himself after his being oppressed,
<br>  these it is against whom there is no way (to blame).
<br>
<a name = "verse42_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.42</b>]
<br>
<br> The way (to blame) is only against those who oppress men  and revolt in the earth unjustly;
<br> these shall have a painful  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever is patient and forgiving,
<br> these most surely  are actions due to courage.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And whomsoever Allah makes err,
<br> he has no guardian after  Him;
<br> and you shall see the unjust,
<br> when they see the  punishment,
<br> saying:
<br> Is there any way to return?
<br>
<a name = "verse42_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And you shall see them brought before it humbling  themselves because of the abasements,
<br> looking with a faint  glance.
<br> And those who believe shall say:
<br> Surely the losers  are they who have lost themselves and their followers on the  resurrection day.
<br> Now surely the iniquitous shall remain in  lasting chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall have no friends to help them besides  Allah;
<br> and-- whomsoever Allah makes err,
<br> he shall have no way.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Hearken to your Lord before there comes the day from  Allah for which there shall be no averting;
<br> you shall have  no refuge on that day,
<br> nor shall it be yours to make a  denial.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.48</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they turn aside,
<br> We have not sent you as a  watcher over them;
<br> on you is only to deliver (the message);
<br>  and surely when We make man taste mercy from Us,
<br> he rejoices  thereat;
<br> and if an evil afflicts them on account of what  their hands have already done,
<br> then-surely man is  ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth;
<br> He  creates what He pleases;
<br> He grants to whom He pleases  daughters and grants to whom He pleases sons.
<br>    5O Or He makes them of both sorts,
<br> male and female;
<br> and He  makes whom He pleases barren;
<br> surely He is the Knowing,
<br> the  Powerful.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to  them,
<br> they could not bear to hear and they did not see.
<br>
<a name = "verse42_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus did We reveal to you an inspired book by Our  command.
<br> You did not know what the Book was,
<br> nor (what) the  faith (was),
<br> but We made it a light,
<br> guiding thereby whom We  please of Our servants;
<br> and most surely you show the way to  the right path:
<br>
<a name = "verse42_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>42.53</b>]
<br>
<br> The path of Allah,
<br> Whose is whatsoever is in the heavens  and whatsoever is in the earth;
<br> now surely to Allah do all  affairs eventually come.
