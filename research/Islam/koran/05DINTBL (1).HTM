<br><h3>The Dinner Table</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.

<a name = "verse5_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> fulfill the obligations.
<br> The cattle quadrupeds  are allowed to you except that which is recited to you,
<br> not  violating the prohibition against game when you are entering  upon the performance of the pilgrimage;
<br> surely Allah orders what  He desires.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.2</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not violate the signs appointed by  Allah nor the sacred month,
<br> nor (interfere with) the offerings,
<br> nor  the sacrificial animals with garlands,
<br> nor those going to the sacred  house seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord;
<br> and when you  are free from the obligations of the pilgrimage,
<br> then hunt,
<br> and let  not hatred of a people-- because they hindered you from the  Sacred Masjid-- incite you to exceed the limits,
<br> and help one  another in goodness and piety,
<br> and do not help one another in sin  and aggression;
<br> and be careful of (your duty to) Allah;
<br> surely  Allah is severe in requiting (evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse5_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Forbidden to you is that which dies of itself,
<br> and blood,
<br> and  flesh of swine,
<br> and that on which any other name than that of  Allah has been invoked,
<br> and the strangled (animal) and that  beaten to death,
<br> and that killed by a fall and that killed by being  smitten with the horn,
<br> and that which wild beasts have eaten,
<br>  except what you slaughter,
<br> and what is sacrificed on stones set up  (for idols) and that you divide by the arrows;
<br> that is a transgression.
<br>  This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your  religion,
<br> so fear them not,
<br> and fear Me.
<br> This day have I perfected  for you your religion and completed My favor on you and  chosen for you Islam as a religion;
<br> but whoever is compelled  by hunger,
<br> not inclining willfully to sin,
<br> then surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.4</b>]
<br>
<br> They ask you as to what is allowed to them.
<br> Say:
<br> The good  things are allowed to you,
<br> and what you have taught the beasts  and birds of prey,
<br> training them to hunt-- you teach them of  what Allah has taught you-- so eat of that which they catch for  you and mention the name of Allah over it;
<br> and be careful of  (your duty to) Allah;
<br> surely Allah is swift in reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.5</b>]
<br>
<br> This day (all) the good things are allowed to you;
<br> and the  food of those who have been given the Book is lawful for you  and your food is lawful for them;
<br> and the chaste from among the  believing women and the chaste from among those who have  been given the Book before you (are lawful for you);
<br> when you  have given them their dowries,
<br> taking (them) in marriage,
<br> not  fornicating nor taking them for paramours in secret;
<br> and whoever  denies faith,
<br> his work indeed is of no account,
<br> and in the  hereafter he shall be one of the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.6</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> when you rise up to prayer,
<br> wash your  faces and your hands as far as the elbows,
<br> and wipe your heads  and your feet to the ankles;
<br> and if you are under an obligation to  perform a total ablution,
<br> then wash (yourselves) and if you are  sick or on a journey,
<br> or one of you come from the privy,
<br> or you  have touched the women,
<br> and you cannot find water,
<br> betake  yourselves to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands  therewith,
<br> Allah does not desire to put on you any difficulty,
<br> but  He wishes to purify you and that He may complete His favor on  you,
<br> so that you may be grateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And remember the favor of Allah on you and His covenant  with which He bound you firmly,
<br> when you said:
<br> We have heard  and we obey,
<br> and be careful of (your duty to) Allah,
<br> surely Allah  knows what is in the breasts.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.8</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> Be upright for Allah,
<br> bearers of witness  with justice,
<br> and let not hatred of a people incite you not to act  equitably;
<br> act equitably,
<br> that is nearer to piety,
<br> and he careful of  (your duty to) Allah;
<br> surely Allah is Aware of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has promised to those who believe and do good  deeds (that) they shall have forgiveness and a mighty reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who disbelieve and reject our communications,
<br>  these are the companions of the name.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.11</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> remember Allah's favor on you when  a people had determined to stretch forth their hands towards  you,
<br> but He withheld their hands from you,
<br> and be careful of  (your duty to) Allah;
<br> and on Allah let the believers rely.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly Allah made a covenant with the children of  Israel,
<br> and We raised up among them twelve chieftains;
<br> and  Allah said:
<br> Surely I am with you;
<br> if you keep up prayer and pay  the poor-rate and believe in My apostles and asslst them and  offer to Allah a goodly gift,
<br> I will most certainly cover your evil  deeds,
<br> and I will most certainly cause you to enter into gardens  beneath which rivers flow,
<br> but whoever disbelieves from among  you after that,
<br> he indeed shall lose the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.13</b>]
<br>
<br> But on account of their breaking their covenant We cursed  them and made their hearts hard;
<br> they altered the words from  their places and they neglected a portion of what they were  reminded of;
<br> and you shall always discover treachery in them  excepting a few of them;
<br> so pardon them and turn away;
<br> surely  Allah loves those who do good (to others).
<br>
<a name = "verse5_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And with those who say,
<br> We are Christians,
<br> We made a  covenant,
<br> but they neglected a portion of what they were reminded  of,
<br> therefore We excited among them enmity and hatred  to the day of resurrection;
<br> and Allah will inform them of what  they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.15</b>]
<br>
<br> O followers of the Book!
<br> indeed Our Apostle has come to  you making clear to you much of what you concealed of the  Book and passing over much;
<br> indeed,
<br> there has come to you  light and a clear Book from Allah;
<br>
<a name = "verse5_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.16</b>]
<br>
<br> With it Allah guides him who will follow His pleasure into  the ways of safety and brings them out of utter darkness into  light by His will and guides them to the right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly they disbelieve who say:
<br> Surely,
<br> Allah-- He is  the Messiah,
<br> son of Marium.
<br> Say:
<br> Who then could control  anything as against Allah when He wished to destroy the Messiah  son of Marium and his mother and all those on the earth?
<br> And  Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is  between them;
<br> He creates what He pleases;
<br> and Allah has power  over all things,
<br>
<a name = "verse5_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And the Jews and the Christians say:
<br> We are the sons of  Allah and His beloved ones.
<br> Say:
<br> Why does He then chastise you  for your faults?
<br> Nay,
<br> you are mortals from among those whom  He has created,
<br> He forgives whom He pleases and chastises  whom He pleases;
<br> and Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and  the earth and what is between them,
<br> and to Him is the eventual  coming.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.19</b>]
<br>
<br> O followers of the Book!
<br> indeed Our Apostle has come to  you explaining to you after a cessation of the (mission of the)  apostles,
<br> lest you say:
<br> There came not to us a giver of good news  or a warner,
<br> so indeed there has come to you a giver of good  news and a warner;
<br> and Allah has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Musa said to his people:
<br> O my people!
<br> remember  the favor of Allah upon you when He raised prophets among  you and made you kings and gave you what He had not given to  any other among the nations.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.21</b>]
<br>
<br> O my people!
<br> enter the holy land which Allah has prescribed  for you and turn not on your backs for then you will turn  back losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.22</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> surely there is a strong race in it,
<br> and  we will on no account enter it until they go out from it,
<br> so if they  go out from it,
<br> then surely we will enter.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Two men of those who feared,
<br> upon both of whom Allah  had bestowed a favor,
<br> said:
<br> Enter upon them by the gate,
<br> for  when you have entered it you shall surely be victorious,
<br> and on  Allah should you rely if you are believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.24</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> we shall never enter it so long as they  are in it;
<br> go therefore you and your Lord,
<br> then fight you both  surely we will here sit down.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.25</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> Surely I have no control (upon any)  but my own self and my brother;
<br> therefore make a separation  between us and the nation of transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.26</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> So it shall surely be forbidden to them for forty  years,
<br> they shall wander about in the land,
<br> therefore do not  grieve for the nation of transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And relate to them the story of the two sons of Adam with  truth when they both offered an offering,
<br> but it was accepted  from one of them and was not accepted from the other.
<br> He said:
<br> I  I will most certainly slay you.
<br> (The other) said:
<br> Allah only  accepts from those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse5_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.28</b>]
<br>
<br> If you will stretch forth your hand towards me to slay me,
<br>  I am not one to stretch forth my hand towards you to slay you  surely I fear Allah,
<br> the Lord of the worlds:
<br>
<a name = "verse5_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I wish that you should bear the sin committed  against me and your own sin,
<br> and so you would be of the  inmates of the fire,
<br> and this is the recompense of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Then his mind facilitated to him the slaying of his brother  so he slew him;
 then he became one of the losers<br>
<a name = "verse5_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Then Allah sent a crow digging up the earth so that he  might show him how he should cover the dead body of his  brother.
<br> He said:
<br> Woe me!
<br> do I lack the strength that I should be  like this crow and cover the dead body of my brother?
<br> So he  became of those who regret.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.32</b>]
<br>
<br> For this reason did We prescribe to the children of Israel  that whoever slays a soul,
<br> unless it be for manslaughter or for  mischief in the land,
<br> it is as though he slew all men;
<br> and whoever  keeps it alive,
<br> it is as though he kept alive all men;
<br> and certainly  Our apostles came to them with clear arguments,
<br> but even after  that many of them certainly act extravagantly in the land.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.33</b>]
<br>
<br> The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and  His apostle and strive to make mischief in the land is only this,
<br>  that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and  their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be  imprisoned;
<br> this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world,
<br> and  in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement,
<br>
<a name = "verse5_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Except those who repent before you have them in your  power;
<br> so know that Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.35</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> be careful of (your duty to) Allah and  seek means of nearness to Him and strive hard in His way that  you may be successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who disbelieve,
<br> even if they had what  is in the earth,
<br> all of it,
<br> and the like of it with it,
<br> that they might  ransom themselves with it from the punishment of the day of  resurrection,
<br> it shall not be accepted from them,
<br> and they shall  have a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.37</b>]
<br>
<br> They would desire to go forth from the fire,
<br> and they shall  not go forth from it,
<br> and they shall have a lasting punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) the man who steals and the woman who  steals,
<br> cut off their hands as a punishment for what they have  earned,
<br> an exemplary punishment from Allah;
<br> and Allah is  Mighty,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.39</b>]
<br>
<br> But whoever repents after his iniquity and reforms (himself),
<br>  then surely Allah will turn to him (mercifully);
<br> surely Allah  is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not know that Allah-- His is the kingdom of the  heavens and the earth;
<br> He chastises whom He pleases;
<br> and forgives  whom He pleases and Allah has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.41</b>]
<br>
<br> O Apostle!
<br> let not those grieve you who strive together in  hastening to unbelief from among those who say with their  mouths:
<br> We believe,
<br> and their hearts do not believe,
<br> and from  among those who are Jews;
<br> they are listeners for the sake of a lie,
<br>  listeners for another people who have not come to you;
<br> they alter  the words from their places,
<br> saying:
<br> If you are given this,
<br> take it,
<br>  and if you are not given this,
<br> be cautious;
<br> and as for him whose  temptation Allah desires,
<br> you cannot control anything for him  with Allah.
<br> Those are they for whom Allah does not desire that  He should purify their hearts;
<br> they shall have disgrace in this  world,
<br> and they shall have a grievous chastisement in the hereafter.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.42</b>]
<br>
<br> (They are) listeners of a lie,
<br> devourers of what is forbidden;
<br>  therefore if they come to you,
<br> judge between them or  turn aside from them,
<br> and if you turn aside from them,
<br> they shall  not harm you in any way;
<br> and if you judge,
<br> judge between them  with equity;
<br> surely Allah loves those who judge equitably.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And how do they make you a judge and they have the  Taurat wherein is Allah's judgment?
<br> Yet they turn back after  that,
<br> and these are not the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We revealed the Taurat in which was guidance and  light;
<br> with it the prophets who submitted themselves (to Allah)  judged (matters) for those who were Jews,
<br> and the masters of  Divine knowledge and the doctors,
<br> because they were required  to guard (part) of the Book of Allah,
<br> and they were witnesses  thereof;
<br> therefore fear not the people and fear Me,
<br> and do not  take a small price for My communications;
<br> and whoever did not  judge by what Allah revealed,
<br> those are they that are the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And We prescribed to them in it that life is for life,
<br> and  eye for eye,
<br> and nose for nose,
<br> and ear for ear,
<br> and tooth for  tooth,
<br> and (that there is) reprisal in wounds;
<br> but he who foregoes  it,
<br> it shall be an expiation for him;
<br> and whoever did not judge by  what Allah revealed,
<br> those are they that are the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And We sent after them in their footsteps Isa,
<br> son of  Marium,
<br> verifying what was before him of the Taurat and We  gave him the Injeel in which was guidance and light,
<br> and verifying  what was before it of Taurat and a guidance and an admonition  for those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse5_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And the followers of the Injeel should have judged by  what Allah revealed in it;
<br> and whoever did not judge by what  Allah revealed,
<br> those are they that are the transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth,
<br>  verifying what is before it of the Book and a guardian over it,
<br>  therefore judge between them by what Allah has revealed,
<br> and  do not follow their low desires (to turn away) from the truth  that has come to you;
<br> for every one of you did We appoint a law  and a way,
<br> and if Allah had pleased He would have made you  (all) a single people,
<br> but that He might try you in what He gave  you,
<br> therefore strive with one another to hasten to virtuous  deeds;
<br> to Allah is your return,
<br> of all (of you),
<br> so He will let you  know that in which you differed;
<br>
<a name = "verse5_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And that you should judge between them by what Allah  has revealed,
<br> and do not follow their low desires,
<br> and be cautious  of them,
<br> lest they seduce you from part of what Allah has  revealed to you;
<br> but if they turn back,
<br> then know that Allah  desires to afflict them on account of some of their faults;
<br> and  most surely many of the people are transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Is it then the judgment of (the times of) ignorance that  they desire?
<br> And who is better than Allah to judge for a people  who are sure?
<br>
<a name = "verse5_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.51</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not take the Jews and the Christians  for friends;
<br> they are friends of each other;
<br> and whoever amongst  you takes them for a friend,
<br> then surely he is one of them;
<br> surely  Allah does not guide the unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.52</b>]
<br>
<br> But you will see those in whose hearts is a disease hastening  towards them,
<br> saying:
<br> We fear lest a calamity should befall  us;
<br> but it may be that Allah will bring the victory or a punish  ment from Himself,
<br> so that they shall be regretting on account of  what they hid in their souls.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who believe will say:
<br> Are these they who swore  by Allah with the most forcible of their oaths that they were  most surely with you?
<br> Their deeds shall go for nothing,
<br> so they  shall become losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.54</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> whoever from among you turns back  from his religion,
<br> then Allah will bring a people,
<br> He shall love  them and they shall love Him,
<br> lowly before the believers,
<br> mighty  against the unbelievers,
<br> they shall strive hard in Allah's way and  shall not fear the censure of any censurer;
<br> this is Allah's Face,
<br>  He gives it to whom He pleases,
<br> and Allah is Ample-giving,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Only Allah is your Vali and His Apostle and those who  believe,
<br> those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while  they bow.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever takes Allah and His apostle and those who  believe for a guardian,
<br> then surely the party of Allah are they  that shall be triumphant.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.57</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not take for guardians those who  take your religion for a mockery and a joke,
<br> from among those  who were given the Book before you and the unbelievers;
<br> and be  careful of (your duty to) Allah if you are believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse5_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>5.58</b>]
