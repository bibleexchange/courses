<p><h3>Book 78</h3>
<br><h3>The Great Event</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse78_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Of what do they ask one another?
<br>
<a name = "verse78_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.2</b>]
<br>
<br> About the great event,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.3</b>]
<br>
<br> About which they differ?
<br>
<a name = "verse78_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
 they shall soon come to know  <br>
<a name = "verse78_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Nay!
<br> Nay!
<br> they shall soon know.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Have We not made the earth an even expanse?
<br>
<a name = "verse78_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And the mountains as projections (thereon)?
<br>
<a name = "verse78_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And We created you in pairs,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made your sleep to be rest (to you),
<br>
<a name = "verse78_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made the night to be a covering,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made the day for seeking livelihood.
<br>    2.
<br> And We made above you seven strong ones,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made a shining lamp,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And We send down from the clouds water pouring forth  abundantly,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.15</b>]
<br>
<br> That We may bring forth thereby corn and herbs,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And gardens dense and luxuriant.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the day of decision is (a day) appointed:
<br>
<a name = "verse78_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.18</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which the trumpet shall be blown so you.
<br>shall  come forth in hosts,
<br>    19 And the heaven shall be opened so that it shall be all  openings,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And the mountains shall be moved off so that they shall  remain a mere semblance.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely hell lies in wait,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.22</b>]
<br>
<br> A place of resort for the inordinate,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Living therein for ages.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.24</b>]
<br>
 They shall not taste therein cool nor drink<br>
<a name = "verse78_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.25</b>]
<br>
<br> But boiling and intensely cold water,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Requital corresponding.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they feared not the account,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And called Our communications a lie,
<br> giving the lie (to  the truth).
<br>
<a name = "verse78_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have recorded everything in a book,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.30</b>]
<br>
<br> So taste!
<br> for We will not add to you aught but  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely for those who guard (against evil) is  achievement,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Gardens and vineyards,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And those showing freshness of youth,
<br> equals in age,
<br>
<a name = "verse78_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And a pure cup.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.35</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall not hear therein any vain words nor lying.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.36</b>]
<br>
<br> A reward from your Lord,
<br> a gift according to a  reckoning:
<br>
<a name = "verse78_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.37</b>]
<br>
<br> The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is  between them,
<br> the Beneficent God,
<br> they shall not be able to  address Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.38</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which the spirit and the angels shall stand  in ranks;
<br> they shall not speak except he whom the Beneficent  God permits and who speaks the right thing.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.39</b>]
<br>
<br> That is the sure day,
<br> so whoever desires may take refuge  with his Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse78_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>78.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have warned you of a chastisement near at  hand:
<br> the day when man shall see what his two hands have  sent before,
<br> and the unbeliever shall say:
<br> O!
<br> would that I  were dust!
