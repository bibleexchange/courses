<p><h3>Book 41</h3>
<br><h3>Ha Mim</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse41_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ha Mim!
<br>
<a name = "verse41_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.2</b>]
<br>
<br> A revelation from the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful God:
<br>
<a name = "verse41_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.3</b>]
<br>
<br> A Book of which the verses are made plain,
<br> an Arabic  Quran for a people who know:
<br>
<a name = "verse41_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.4</b>]
<br>
<br> A herald of good news and a warner,
<br> but most of them turn  aside so they hear not.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Our hearts are under coverings from that to  which you call us,
<br> and there is a heaviness in our ears,
<br> and  a veil hangs between us and you,
<br> so work,
<br> we too are  working.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I am only a mortal like you;
<br> it is revealed to me  that your God is one God,
<br> therefore follow the right way to  Him and ask His forgiveness;
<br> and woe to the polytheists;
<br>
<a name = "verse41_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.7</b>]
<br>
<br> (To) those who do not give poor-rate and they are  unbelievers in the hereafter.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.8</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who believe and do good,
<br> they shall surely  have a reward never to be cut off.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> What!
<br> do you indeed disbelieve in Him Who created  the earth in two periods,
<br> and do you set up equals with Him?
<br>  That is the Lord of the Worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And He made in it mountains above its surface,
<br> and He  blessed therein and made therein its foods,
<br> in four periods:
<br>  alike for the seekers.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Then He directed Himself to the heaven and it is a  vapor,
<br> so He said to it and to the earth:
<br> Come both,
<br>  willingly or unwillingly.
<br> They both said:
<br> We come willingly.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.12</b>]
<br>
<br> So He ordained them seven heavens in two periods,
<br> and  revealed in every heaven its affair;
<br> and We adorned the  lower heaven with brilliant stars and (made it) to guard;
<br>  that is the decree of the Mighty,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.13</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they turn aside,
<br> then say:
<br> I have warned you of a  scourge like the scourge of Ad and Samood.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.14</b>]
<br>
<br> When their apostles came to them from before them and  from behind them,
<br> saying,
<br> Serve nothing but Allah,
<br> they  said:
<br> If our Lord had pleased He would certainly have sent  down angels,
<br> so we are surely unbelievers in that with which  you are sent.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Then as to Ad,
<br> they were unjustly proud in the land,
<br> and  they said:
<br> Who is mightier in strength than we?
<br> Did they not  see that Allah Who created them was mightier than they in  strength,
<br> and they denied Our communications?
<br>
<a name = "verse41_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.16</b>]
<br>
<br> So We sent on them a furious wind in unlucky days,
<br> that  We may make them taste the chastisement of abasement in this  world's life;
<br> and certainly the chastisement of the  hereafter is much more abasing,
<br> and they shall not be  helped.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And as to Samood,
<br> We showed them the right way,
<br> but they  chose error above guidance,
<br> so there overtook them the  scourge of an abasing chastisement for what they earned.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And We delivered those who believed and guarded (against  evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse41_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day that the enemies of Allah shall be  brought together to the fire,
<br> then they shall be formed into  groups.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when they come to it,
<br> their ears and their eyes  and their skins shall bear witness against them as to what  they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall say to their skins:
<br> Why have you borne  witness against us?
<br> They shall say:
<br> Allah Who makes  everything speak has made us speak,
<br> and He created you at  first,
<br> and to Him you shall be brought back.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And you did not veil yourselves lest your ears and your  eyes and your skins should bear witness against you,
<br> but you  thought that Allah did not know most of what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And that was your (evil) thought which you entertained  about your Lord that has tumbled you down into perdition,
<br> so  are you become of the lost ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Then if they will endure,
<br> still the fire is their abode,
<br>  and if they ask for goodwill,
<br> then are they not of those who  shall be granted goodwill.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have appointed for them comrades so they have  made fair-seeming to them what is before them and what is  behind them,
<br> and the word proved true against them-- among the  nations of the jinn and the men that have passed away before  them-- that they shall surely be losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> Do not listen to this  Quran and make noise therein,
<br> perhaps you may overcome.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore We will most certainly make those who  disbelieve taste a severe punishment,
<br> and We will most  certainly reward them for the evil deeds they used to do.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.28</b>]
<br>
<br> That is the reward of the enemies of Allah-- the fire;
<br> for  them therein shall be the house of long abiding;
<br> a reward  for their denying Our communications.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve will say:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> show us  those who led us astray from among the jinn and the men that  we may trample them under our feet so that they may be of  the lowest.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.30</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who say:
<br> Our Lord is Allah,
<br> then continue  in the right way,
<br> the angels descend upon them,
<br> saying:
<br> Fear  not,
<br> nor be grieved,
<br> and receive good news of the garden  which you were promised.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.31</b>]
<br>
<br> We are your guardians in this world's life and in the  hereafter,
<br> and you shall have therein what your souls desire  and you shall have therein what you ask for:
<br>
<a name = "verse41_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.32</b>]
<br>
<br> A provision from the Forgiving,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And who speaks better than he who calls to Allah while  he himself does good,
<br> and says:
<br> I am surely of those who  submit?
<br>
<a name = "verse41_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And not alike are the good and the evil.
<br> Repel (evil)  with what is best,
<br> when lo!
<br> he between whom and you was  enmity would be as if he were a warm friend.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And none are made to receive it but those who are  patient,
<br> and none are made to receive it but those who have  a mighty good fortune.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And if an interference of the Shaitan should cause you  mischief,
<br> seek refuge in Allah;
<br> surely He is the Hearing,
<br>  the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And among His signs are the night and the day and the  sun and the moon;
<br> do not make obeisance to the sun nor to  the moon;
<br> and make obeisance to Allah Who created them,
<br> if  Him it is that you serve.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.38</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they are proud,
<br> yet those with your Lord glorify  Him during the night and the day,
<br> and they are not tired.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And among His signs is this,
<br> that you see the earth  still,
<br> but when We send down on it the water,
<br> it stirs and  swells:
<br> most surely He Who gives it life is the Giver of  life to the dead;
<br> surely He has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they who deviate from the right way concerning  Our communications are not hidden from Us.
<br> What!
<br> is he then  who is cast into the fire better,
<br> or he who comes safe on  the day of resurrection?
<br> Do what you like,
<br> surely He sees  what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who disbelieve in the reminder when it  comes to them,
<br> and most surely it is a Mighty Book:
<br>
<a name = "verse41_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Falsehood shall not come to it from before it nor from  behind it;
<br> a revelation from the Wise,
<br> the Praised One.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Naught is said to you but what was said indeed to the  apostles before you;
<br> surely your Lord is the Lord of  forgiveness and the Lord of painful retribution.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We had made it a Quran in a foreign tongue,
<br> they  would certainly have said:
<br> Why have not its communications  been made clear?
<br> What!
<br> a foreign (tongue) and an Arabian!
<br>  Say:
<br> It is to those who believe a guidance and a healing;
<br>  and (as for) those who do not believe,
<br> there is a heaviness  in their ears and it is obscure to them;
<br> these shall be  called to from a far-off place.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave the Book to Musa,
<br> but it has been  differed about,
<br> and had not a word already gone forth from  your Lord,
<br> judgment would certainly have been given between  them;
<br> and most surely they are in a disquieting doubt about  it.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever does good,
<br> it is for his own soul,
<br> and whoever  does evil,
<br> it is against it;
<br> and your Lord is not in the  least unjust to the servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.47</b>]
<br>
<br> To Him is referred the knowledge of the hour,
<br> and there  come not forth any of the fruits from their coverings,
<br> nor  does a female bear,
<br> nor does she give birth,
<br> but with His  knowledge;
<br> and on the day when He shall call out to them,
<br>  Where are (those whom you called) My associates?
<br> They shall  say:
<br> We declare to Thee,
<br> none of us is a witness.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And away from them shall go what they called upon  before,
<br> and they shall know for certain that there is no  escape for them.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Man is never tired of praying for good,
<br> and if evil  touch him,
<br> then he is despairing,
<br> hopeless.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We make him taste mercy from Us after distress  that has touched him,
<br> he would most certainly say:
<br> This is  of me,
<br> and I do not think the hour will come to pass,
<br> and if  I am sent back to my Lord,
<br> I shall have with Him sure good;
<br>  but We will most certainly inform those who disbelieved of  what they did,
<br> and We will most certainly make them taste of  hard chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We show favor to man,
<br> he turns aside and  withdraws himself;
<br> and when evil touches him,
<br> he makes  lengthy supplications.
<br>
<a name = "verse41_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Tell me if it is from Allah;
<br> then you disbelieve in  it,
<br> who is in greater error than he who is in a prolonged  opposition?
<br>
<a name = "verse41_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.53</b>]
<br>
<br> We will soon show them Our signs in the Universe and in  their own souls,
<br> until it will become quite clear to them  that it is the truth.
<br> Is it not sufficient as regards your  Lord that He is a witness over all things?
<br>
<a name = "verse41_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>41.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Now surely they are in doubt as to the meeting of their  Lord;
<br> now surely He encompasses all things.
