<p><h3>Book 13</h3>
<br><h3>The Thunder</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse13_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Mim Ra.
<br> These are the verses of the Book;
<br> and  that which is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth,
<br>  but most people do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars  that you see,
<br> and He is firm in power and He made the sun  and the moon subservient (to you);
<br> each one pursues its  course to an appointed time;
<br> He regulates the affair,
<br> making  clear the signs that you may be certain of meeting your  Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who spread the earth and made in it firm  mountains and rivers,
<br> and of all fruits He has made in it  two kinds;
<br> He makes the night cover the day;
<br> most surely  there are signs in this for a people who reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And in the earth there are tracts side by side and  gardens of grapes and corn and palm trees having one root  and (others) having distinct roots-- they are watered with one  water,
<br> and We make some of them excel others in fruit;
<br> most  surely there are signs in this for a people who understand.
  <br>
<a name = "verse13_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  And if you would wonder,
<br> then wondrous is their saying:
<br>  What!
<br> when we are dust,
<br> shall we then certainly be in a new  creation?
<br> These are they who disbelieve in their Lord,
<br> and  these have chains on their necks,
<br> and they are the inmates  of the fire;
<br> in it they shall abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good,
<br>  and indeed there have been exemplary punishments before  them;
<br> and most surely your Lord is the Lord of forgiveness  to people,
<br> notwithstanding their injustice;
<br> and most surely  your Lord is severe in requiting (evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse13_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> Why has not a sign been  sent down upon him from his Lord?
<br> You are only a warner and  (there is) a guide for every people.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah knows what every female bears,
<br> and that of which  the wombs fall short of completion and that in which they  increase;
<br> and there is a measure with Him of everything.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.9</b>]
<br>
<br> The knower of the unseen and the seen,
<br> the Great,
<br> the  Most High.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Alike (to Him) among you is he who conceals (his) words  and he who speaks them openly,
<br> and he who hides himself by  night and (who) goes forth by day.
<br>    11 .
<br> For his sake there are angels following one another,
<br>  before him and behind him,
<br> who guard him by Allah's  commandment;
<br> surely Allah does not change the condition of a  people until they change their own condition;
<br> and when Allah  intends evil to a people,
<br> there is no averting it,
<br> and  besides Him they have no protector.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.12</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who shows you the lightning causing fear and  hope and (Who) brings up the heavy cloud.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And the thunder declares His glory with His praise,
<br> and  the angels too for awe of Him;
<br> and He sends the thunderbolts  and smites with them whom He pleases,
<br> yet they dispute  concerning Allah,
<br> and He is mighty in prowess.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.14</b>]
<br>
<br> To Him is due the true prayer;
<br> and those whom they pray  to besides Allah give them no answer,
<br> but (they are) like  one who stretches forth his two hands towards water that it  may reach his mouth,
<br> but it will not reach it;
<br> and the  prayer of the unbelievers is only in error.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever is in the heavens and the earth makes  obeisance to Allah only,
<br> willingly and unwillingly,
<br> and  their shadows too at morn and eve.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?
<br>-- Say:
<br>  Allah.
<br> Say:
<br> Do you take then besides Him guardians who do  not control any profit or harm for themselves?
<br> Say:
<br> Are the  blind and the seeing alike?
<br> Or can the darkness and the  light be equal?
<br> Or have they set up with Allah associates  who have created creation like His,
<br> so that what is created  became confused to them?
<br> Say:
<br> Allah is the Creator of all  things,
<br> and He is the One,
<br> the Supreme.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.17</b>]
<br>
<br> He sends down water from the cloud,
<br> then watercourses  flow (with water) according to their measure,
<br> and the  torrent bears along the swelling foam,
<br> and from what they  melt in the fire for the sake of making ornaments or  apparatus arises a scum like it;
<br> thus does Allah compare  truth and falsehood;
<br> then as for the scum,
<br> it passes away as  a worthless thing;
<br> and as for that which profits the people,
<br>  it tarries in the earth;
<br> thus does Allah set forth parables.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.18</b>]
<br>
<br> For those who respond to their Lord is good;
<br> and (as  for) those who do not respond to Him,
<br> had they all that is  in the earth and the like thereof with it they would  certainly offer it for a ransom.
<br> (As for) those,
<br> an evil  reckoning shall be theirs and their abode is hell,
<br> and evil  is the resting-place.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Is he then who knows that what has been revealed to you  from your Lord is the truth like him who is blind?
<br> Only  those possessed of understanding will mind,
<br>
<a name = "verse13_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who fulfil the promise of Allah and do not break  the covenant,
<br>
<a name = "verse13_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who join that which Allah has bidden to be  joined and have awe of their Lord and fear the evil  reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who are constant,
<br> seeking the pleasure of  their Lord,
<br> and keep up prayer and spend (benevolently) out  of what We have given them secretly and openly and repel  evil with good;
<br> as for those,
 they shall have the (happy)  issue of the abode<br>
<a name = "verse13_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.23</b>]
<br>
<br> The gardens of perpetual abode which they will enter  along with those who do good from among their parents and  their spouses and their offspring;
<br> and the angels will enter  in upon them from every gate:
<br>
<a name = "verse13_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Peace be on you because you were constant,
<br> how  excellent,
<br> is then,
<br> the issue of the abode.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who break the covenant of Allah after its  confirmation and cut asunder that which Allah has ordered to  be joined and make mischief in the land;
<br> (as for) those,
<br>  upon them shall be curse and they shall have the evil  (issue) of the abode.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah amplifies and straitens the means of subsistence  for whom He pleases;
<br> and they rejoice in this world's life,
<br>  and this world's life is nothing compared with the hereafter  but a temporary enjoyment.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> Why is not a sign sent  down upon him by his Lord?
<br> Say:
<br> Surely Allah makes him who  will go astray,
<br> and guides to Himself those who turn (to  Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse13_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who believe and whose hearts are set at rest by  the remembrance of Allah;
<br> now surely by Allah's remembrance  are the hearts set at rest.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.29</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who believe and do good,
<br> a good final  state shall be theirs and a goodly return.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus We have sent you among a nation before which  other nations have passed away,
<br> that you might recite to  them what We have revealed to you and (still) they deny the  Beneficent God.
<br> Say:
<br> He is my Lord,
<br> there is no god but He;
<br>  on Him do I rely and to Him is my return.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And even if there were a Quran with which the mountains  were made to pass away,
<br> or the earth were travelled over  with it,
<br> or the dead were made to speak thereby;
<br> nay!
<br> the  commandment is wholly Allah's,
<br> Have not yet those who  believe known that if Allah please He would certainly guide  all the people?
<br> And (as for) those who disbelieve,
<br> there  will not cease to afflict them because of what they do a  repelling calamity,
<br> or it will alight close by their abodes,
<br>  until the promise of Allah comes about;
<br> surely Allah will  not fail in (His) promise.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And apostles before you were certainly mocked at,
<br> but I  gave respite to those who disbelieved,
<br> then I destroyed  them;
<br> how then was My requital (of evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse13_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Is He then Who watches every soul as to what it earns?
<br>  And yet they give associates to Allah!
<br> Say:
<br> Give them a  name;
<br> nay,
<br> do you mean to inform Him of what He does not  know in the earth,
<br> or (do you affirm this) by an outward  saying?
<br> Rather,
<br> their plans are made to appear fair-seeming  to those who disbelieve,
<br> and they are kept back from the  path;
<br> and whom Allah makes err,
<br> he shall have no guide.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.34</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall have chastisement in this world's life,
<br> and  the chastisement of the hereafter is certainly more  grievous,
<br> and they shall have no protector against Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.35</b>]
<br>
<br> A likeness of the garden which the righteous are  promised;
<br> there now beneath it rivers,
<br> its food and shades  are perpetual;
<br> this is the requital of those who guarded  (against evil),
<br> and the requital of the unbelievers is the  fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And those to whom We have given the Book rejoice in that  which has been revealed to you,
<br> and of the confederates are  some who deny a part of it.
<br> Say:
<br> I am only commanded that I  should serve Allah and not associate anything with Him,
<br> to  Him do I invite (you) and to Him is my return.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus have We revealed it,
<br> a true judgment in Arabic,
<br>  and if you follow their low desires after what has come to  you of knowledge,
<br> you shall not have against Allah any  guardian or a protector.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent apostles before you and gave them  wives and children,
<br> and it is not in (the power of) an  apostle to bring a sign except by Allah's permission;
<br> for  every term there is an appointment.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah makes to pass away and establishes what He  pleases,
<br> and with Him is the basis of the Book.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And We will either let you see part of what We threaten  them with or cause you to die,
<br> for only the delivery of the  message is (incumbent) on you,
<br> while calling (them) to  account is Our (business).
<br>
<a name = "verse13_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not see that We are bringing destruction upon  the land by curtailing it of its sides?
<br> And Allah pronounces  a doom-- there is no repeller of His decree,
<br> and He is swift  to take account.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And those before them did indeed make plans,
<br> but all  planning is Allah's;
<br> He knows what every soul earns,
<br> and the  unbelievers shall come to know for whom is the (better)  issue of the abode.
<br>
<a name = "verse13_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>13.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> You are not a messenger.
<br>  Say:
<br> Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you and  whoever has knowledge of the Book.
