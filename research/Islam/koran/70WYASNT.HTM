<p><h3>Book 70</h3>
<br><h3>The Ways of Ascent</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse70_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.1</b>]
<br>
<br> One demanding,
 demanded the chastisement which must  befall<br>
<a name = "verse70_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.2</b>]
<br>
 The unbelievers-- there is none to avert it--<br>
<a name = "verse70_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.3</b>]
<br>
<br> From Allah,
<br> the Lord of the ways of Ascent.
<br>
<a name = "verse70_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.4</b>]
<br>
<br> To Him ascend the angels and the Spirit in a day the  measure of which is fifty thousand years.
  <br>
<a name = "verse70_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Therefore endure with a goodly patience.
<br>
<a name = "verse70_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they think it to be far off,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And We see it nigh.
<br>
<a name = "verse70_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.8</b>]
<br>
 On the day when the heaven shall be as molten copper<br>
<a name = "verse70_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.9</b>]
<br>
 And the mountains shall be as tufts of wool<br>
<a name = "verse70_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.10</b>]
<br>
 And friend shall not ask of friend<br>
<a name = "verse70_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.11</b>]
<br>
<br> (Though) they shall be made to see each other.
<br> The  guilty one would fain redeem himself from the chastisement  of that day by (sacrificing) his children,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.12</b>]
<br>
 And his wife and his brother<br>
<a name = "verse70_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And the nearest of his kinsfolk who gave him shelter,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And all those that are in the earth,
<br> (wishing) then  (that) this might deliver him.
<br>
<a name = "verse70_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.15</b>]
<br>
<br> By no means!
 Surely it is a flaming fire<br>
<a name = "verse70_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Dragging by the head,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.17</b>]
<br>
<br> It shall claim him who turned and fled (from truth),
<br>
<a name = "verse70_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And amasses (wealth) then shuts it up.
<br>
<a name = "verse70_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.19</b>]
<br>
 Surely man is created of a hasty temperament<br>
<a name = "verse70_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.20</b>]
<br>
 Being greatly grieved when evil afflicts him<br>
<a name = "verse70_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.21</b>]
<br>
 And niggardly when good befalls him<br>
<a name = "verse70_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Except those who pray,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.23</b>]
<br>
 Those who are constant at their prayer<br>
<a name = "verse70_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And those in whose wealth there is a fixed portion.
<br>
<a name = "verse70_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.25</b>]
<br>
 For him who begs and for him who is denied (good)<br>
<a name = "verse70_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.26</b>]
<br>
 And those who accept the truth of the judgment day<br>
<a name = "verse70_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.27</b>]
<br>
 And those who are fearful of the chastisement of their  Lord--<br>
<a name = "verse70_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.28</b>]
<br>
 Surely the chastisement of their Lord is (a thing) not  to be felt secure of--<br>
<a name = "verse70_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who guard their private parts,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Except in the case of their wives or those whom their  right hands possess-- for these surely are not to be blamed,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.31</b>]
<br>
<br> But he who seeks to go beyond this,
 these it is that go  beyond the limits--<br>
<a name = "verse70_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.32</b>]
<br>
 And those who are faithful to their trusts and their  covenant<br>
<a name = "verse70_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who are upright in their testimonies,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who keep a guard on their prayer,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Those shall be in gardens,
<br> honored.
<br>
<a name = "verse70_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.36</b>]
<br>
<br> But what is the matter with those who disbelieve that  they hasten on around you,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.37</b>]
<br>
<br> On the right hand and on the left,
<br> in sundry parties?
<br>
<a name = "verse70_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Does every man of them desire that he should be made to  enter the garden of bliss?
<br>
<a name = "verse70_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.39</b>]
<br>
<br> By no means!
<br> Surely We have created them of what they  know.
<br>
<a name = "verse70_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.40</b>]
<br>
<br> But nay!
 I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the Wests  that We are certainly able<br>
<a name = "verse70_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.41</b>]
<br>
<br> To bring instead (others) better than them,
<br> and We shall  not be overcome.
<br>
<a name = "verse70_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore leave them alone to go on with the false  discourses and to sport until they come face to face with  that day of theirs with which they are threatened;
<br>
<a name = "verse70_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.43</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which they shall come forth from their graves  in haste,
<br> as if they were hastening on to a goal,
<br>
<a name = "verse70_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>70.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Their eyes cast down;
<br> disgrace shall overtake them;
<br> that  is the day which they were threatened with.
