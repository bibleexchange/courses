<p><h3>Book 39</h3>
<br><h3>The Companions</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse39_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.1</b>]
<br>
<br> The revelation of the Book is from Allah,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the  Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth,
<br>  therefore serve Allah,
<br> being sincere to Him in obedience.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Now,
<br> surely,
<br> sincere obedience is due to Allah (alone)  and (as for) those who take guardians besides Him,
<br> (saying),
<br>  We do not serve them save that they may make us nearer to  Allah,
<br> surely Allah will judge between them in that in which  they differ;
<br> surely Allah does not guide him aright who is a  liar,
<br> ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.4</b>]
<br>
<br> If Allah desire to take a son to Himself,
<br> He will surely  choose those He pleases from what He has created.
<br> Glory be  to Him:
<br> He is Allah,
<br> the One,
<br> the Subduer (of all).
<br>
<a name = "verse39_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.5</b>]
<br>
<br> He has created the heavens and the earth with the truth;
<br>  He makes the night cover the day and makes the day overtake  the night,
<br> and He has made the sun and the moon subservient;
<br>  each one runs on to an assigned term;
<br> now surely He is the  Mighty,
<br> the great Forgiver.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.6</b>]
<br>
<br> He has created you from a single being,
<br> then made its  mate of the same (kind),
<br> and He has made for you eight of  the cattle in pairs.
<br> He creates you in the wombs of your  mothers-- a creation after a creation-- in triple darkness;
<br> that  is Allah your Lord,
<br> His is the kingdom;
<br> there is no god but  He;
<br> whence are you then turned away?
<br>
<a name = "verse39_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.7</b>]
<br>
<br> If you are ungrateful,
<br> then surely Allah is  Self-sufficient above all need of you;
<br> and He does not like  ungratefulness in His servants;
<br> and if you are grateful,
<br> He  likes it in you;
<br> and no bearer of burden shall bear the  burden of another;
<br> then to your Lord is your return,
<br> then  will He inform you of what you did;
<br> surely He is Cognizant  of what is in the breasts.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And when distress afflicts a man he calls upon his Lord  turning to Him frequently;
<br> then when He makes him possess a  favor from Him,
<br> he forgets that for which he called upon Him  before,
<br> and sets up rivals to Allah that he may cause (men)  to stray off from His path.
<br> Say:
<br> Enjoy yourself in your  ungratefulness a little,
<br> surely you are of the inmates of  the fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.9</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> he who is obedient during hours of the night,
<br>  prostrating himself and standing,
<br> takes care of the  hereafter and hopes for the mercy of his Lord!
<br> Say:
<br> Are  those who know and those who do not know alike?
<br> Only the men  of understanding are mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O my servants who believe!
<br> be careful of (your duty  to) your Lord;
<br> for those who do good in this world is good,
<br>  and Allah's earth is spacious;
<br> only the patient will be paid  back their reward in full without measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I am commanded that I should serve Allah,
<br> being  sincere to Him in obedience.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And I am commanded that I shall be the first of those  who submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I fear,
<br> if I disobey my Lord,
<br> the chastisement of a  grievous day.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Allah (it is Whom) I serve,
<br> being sincere to Him in  my obedience:
<br>
<a name = "verse39_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Serve then what you like besides Him.
<br> Say:
<br> The losers  surely are those who shall have lost themselves and their  families on the day of resurrection;
<br> now surely that is the  clear loss.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.16</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall have coverings of fire above them and  coverings beneath them;
<br> with that Allah makes His servants  to fear,
<br> so be careful of (your duty to) Me,
<br> O My servants!
<br>    17,
<br> And (as for) those who keep off from the worship of the  idols and turn to Allah,
<br> they shall have good news,
<br>  therefore give good news to My servants,
<br>
<a name = "verse39_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who listen to the word,
<br> then follow the best of  it;
<br> those are they whom Allah has guided,
<br> and those it is  who are the men of understanding.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.19</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> as for him then against whom the sentence of  chastisement is due:
<br> What!
<br> can you save him who is in the  fire?
<br>    .
<br> 20.
<br> But (as for) those who are careful of (their duty to)  their Lord,
<br> they shall have high places,
<br> above them higher  places,
<br> built (for them),
<br> beneath which flow rivers;
<br> (this  is) the promise of Allah:
<br> Allah will not fail in (His)  promise.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the  cloud,
<br> then makes it go along in the earth in springs,
<br> then  brings forth therewith herbage of various colors,
<br> then it  withers so that you see it becoming yellow,
<br> then He makes it  a thing crushed and broken into pieces?
<br> Most surely there is  a reminder in this for the men of understanding.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.22</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> is he whose heart Allah has opened for Islam so  that he is in a light from his Lord (like the hard-hearted)?
<br>  Nay,
<br> woe to those whose hearts are hard against the  remembrance of Allah;
<br> those are in clear error.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has revealed the best announcement,
<br> a book  conformable in its various parts,
<br> repeating,
<br> whereat do  shudder the skins of those who fear their Lord,
<br> then their  skins and their hearts become pliant to the remembrance of  Allah;
<br> this is Allah's guidance,
<br> He guides with it whom He  pleases;
<br> and (as for) him whom Allah makes err,
<br> there is no  guide for him.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Is he then who has to guard himself with his own person  against the evil chastisement on the resurrection day?
<br> And  it will be said to the unjust:
<br> Taste what you earned.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Those before them rejected (prophets),
<br> therefore there  came to them the chastisement from whence they perceived  not.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.26</b>]
<br>
<br> So Allah made them taste the disgrace in this world's  life,
<br> and certainly the punishment of the hereafter is  greater;
<br> did they but know!
<br>
<a name = "verse39_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have set forth to men in this Quran  similitudes of every sort that they may mind.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.28</b>]
<br>
<br> An Arabic Quran without any crookedness,
<br> that they may  guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse39_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah sets forth an example:
<br> There is a slave in whom  are (several) partners differing with one another,
<br> and there  is another slave wholly owned by one man.
<br> Are the two alike  in condition?
<br> (All) praise is due to Allah.
<br> Nay!
<br> most of  them do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely you shall die and they (too) shall surely die.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Then surely on the day of resurrection you will contend  one with another before.
<br> your Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Who is then more unjust than he who utters a lie against  Allah and (he who) gives the lie to the truth when it comes  to him;
<br> is there not in hell an abode for the unbelievers?
<br>
<a name = "verse39_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And he who brings the truth and (he who) accepts it as  the truth-- these are they that guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse39_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.34</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall have with their Lord what they please;
<br> that  is the reward of the doers of good;
<br>
<a name = "verse39_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.35</b>]
<br>
<br> So that Allah will do away with the worst of what they  did and give them their reward for the best of what they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Is not Allah sufficient for His servant?
<br> And they seek  to frighten you with those besides Him;
<br> and whomsoever Allah  makes err,
<br> there is no guide for him.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And whom Allah guides,
<br> there is none that can lead him  astray;
<br> is not Allah Mighty,
<br> the Lord of retribution?
<br>
<a name = "verse39_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And should you ask them,
<br> Who created the heavens and the  earth?
<br> They would most certainly say:
<br> Allah.
<br> Say:
<br> Have you  then considered that what you call upon besides Allah,
<br> would  they,
<br> if Allah desire to afflict me with harm,
<br> be the  removers of His harm,
<br> or (would they),
<br> if Allah desire to  show me mercy,
<br> be the withholders of His mercy?
<br> Say:
<br> Allah  is sufficient for me;
<br> on Him do the reliant rely.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O my people!
<br> work in your place,
<br> surely I am a  worker,
<br> so you will come to know.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Who it is to whom there shall come a punishment which  will disgrace him and to whom will be due a lasting  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth  for the sake of men;
<br> so whoever follows the right way,
<br> it is  for his own soul and whoever errs,
<br> he errs only to its  detriment;
<br> and you are not a custodian over them.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah takes the souls at the time of their death,
<br> and  those that die not during their sleep;
<br> then He withholds  those on whom He has passed the decree of death and sends  the others back till an appointed term;
<br> most surely there  are signs in this for a people who reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they taken intercessors besides Allah?
<br> Say:
<br>  what!
<br> even though they did not ever have control over  anything,
<br> nor do they understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Allah's is the intercession altogether;
<br> His is the  kingdom of the heavens and the earth,
<br> then to Him you shall  be brought back.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Allah alone is mentioned,
<br> the hearts of those  who do not believe in the hereafter shrink,
<br> and when those  besides Him are mentioned,
<br> lo!
<br> they are joyful.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O Allah!
<br> Originator of the heavens and the earth,
<br>  Knower of the unseen and the seen!
<br> Thou (only) judgest  between Thy servants as to that wherein they differ.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And had those who are unjust all that is in the earth  and the like of it with it,
<br> they would certainly offer it as  ransom (to be saved) from the evil of the punishment on the  day of resurrection;
<br> and what they never thought of shall  become plain to them from Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And the evil (consequences) of what they wrought shall  become plain to them,
<br> and the very thing they mocked at  shall beset them.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.49</b>]
<br>
<br> So when harm afflicts a man he calls upon Us;
<br> then,
<br> when  We give him a favor from Us,
<br> he says:
<br> I have been given it  only by means of knowledge.
<br> Nay,
<br> it is a trial,
<br> but most of  them do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Those before them did say it indeed,
<br> but what they  earned availed them not.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.51</b>]
<br>
<br> So there befell them the evil (consequences) of what  they earned;
<br> and (as for) those who are unjust from among  these,
<br> there shall befall them the evil (consequences) of  what they earn,
<br> and they shall not escape.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not know that Allah makes ample the means of  subsistence to whom He pleases,
<br> and He straitens;
<br> most  surely there are signs in this for a people who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.53</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O my servants!
<br> who have acted extravagantly against  their own souls,
<br> do not despair of the mercy of Allah;
<br>  surely Allah forgives the faults altogether;
<br> surely He is  the Forgiving the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And return to your Lord time after time and submit to  Him before there comes to you the punishment,
<br> then you shall  not be helped.
  <br>
<a name = "verse39_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.55</b>]
<br>
<br>  And follow the best that has been revealed to you from  your Lord before there comes to you the punishment all of a  sudden while you do not even perceive;
<br>
<a name = "verse39_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Lest a soul should say:
<br> O woe to me!
<br> for what I fell  short of my duty to Allah,
<br> and most surely I was of those  who laughed to scorn;
<br>
<a name = "verse39_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Or it should say:
<br> Had Allah guided me,
<br> I would certainly  have been of those who guard (against evil);
<br>
<a name = "verse39_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.58</b>]
<br>
<br> Or it should say when it sees the punishment:
<br> Were there    only a returning for me,
<br> I should be of the doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Aye!
<br> My communications came to you,
<br> but you rejected  them,
<br> and you were proud and you were one of the  unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day of resurrection you shall see those who  lied against Allah;
<br> their faces shall be blackened.
<br> Is there  not in hell an abode for the proud?
<br>
<a name = "verse39_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah shall deliver those who guard (against evil)  with their achievement;
<br> evil shall not touch them,
<br> nor shall  they grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.62</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is the Creator of every thing and He has charge  over every thing.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.63</b>]
<br>
<br> His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth;
<br> and  (as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of  Allah,
<br> these it is that are the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> What!
<br> Do you then bid me serve others than Allah,
<br> O  ignorant men?
<br>
<a name = "verse39_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly,
<br> it has been revealed to you and to those  before you:
<br> Surely if you associate (with Allah),
<br> your work  would certainly come to naught and you would certainly be of  the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> but serve Allah alone and be of the thankful.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And they have not honored Allah with the honor that is  due to Him;
<br> and the whole earth shall be in His grip on the  day of resurrection and the heavens rolled up in His right  hand;
<br> glory be to Him,
<br> and may He be exalted above what they  associate (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse39_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And the trumpet shall be blown,
<br> so all those that are in  the heavens and all those that are in the earth shall swoon,
<br>  except such as Allah please;
<br> then it shall be blown again,
<br>  then lo!
<br> they shall stand up awaiting.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And the earth shall beam with the light of its Lord,
<br> and  the Book shall be laid down,
<br> and the prophets and the  witnesses shall be brought up,
<br> and judgment shall be given  between them with justice,
<br> and they shall not be dealt with  unjustly.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.70</b>]
<br>
<br> And every soul shall be paid back fully what it has  done,
<br> and He knows best what they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve shall be driven to hell in  companies;
<br> until,
<br> when they come to it,
<br> its doors shall be  opened,
<br> and the keepers of it shall say to them:
<br> Did not  there come to you apostles from among you reciting to you  the communications of your Lord and warning you of the  meeting of this day of yours?
<br> They shall say:
<br> Yea!
<br> But the  sentence of punishment was due against the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.72</b>]
<br>
<br> It shall be said:
<br> Enter the gates of hell to abide  therein;
<br> so evil is the abode of the proud.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord  shall be conveyed to the garden in companies;
<br> until when  they come to it,
<br> and its doors shall be opened,
<br> and the  keepers of it shall say to them:
<br> Peace be on you,
<br> you shall  be happy;
<br> therefore enter it to abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse39_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>39.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall say:
<br> (All) praise is due to Allah,
<br> Who  has made good to us His promise,
<br> and He has made us inherit  the land;
<br> we may abide in the garden where we please;

<br> And you shall see the angels going round about the  throne glorifying the praise of their Lord;

<br> the Lord of the worlds.
