<p><h3>Book 20</h3>
<br><h3>Ta Ha</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse20_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ta Ha.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.2</b>]
<br>
<br> We have not revealed the Quran to you that you may be  unsuccessful.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> it is a reminder to him who fears:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.4</b>]
<br>
<br> A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high  heavens.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.5</b>]
<br>
<br> The Beneficent God is firm in power.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.6</b>]
<br>
<br> His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and  what is between them two and what is beneath the ground.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you utter the saying aloud,
<br> then surely He knows the  secret,
<br> and what is yet more hidden.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah -- there is no god but He;
<br> His are the very best names.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And has the story of Musa come to you?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.10</b>]
<br>
<br> When he saw fire,
<br> he said to his family:
<br> Stop,
<br> for surely I  see a fire,
<br> haply I may bring to you therefrom a live coal or  find a  guidance at the fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.11</b>]
<br>
<br> So when he came to it,
<br> a voice was uttered:
<br> O Musa:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I am your Lord,
<br> therefore put off your shoes;
<br>  surely you are in the sacred valley,
<br> Tuwa,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And I have chosen you,
<br> so listen to what is revealed:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I am Allah,
<br> there is no god but 1,
<br> therefore serve  Me and keep up prayer for My remembrance:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the hour is coming-- I am about to make it manifest-- so  that every soul may be rewarded as it strives:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore let not him who believes not in it and follows his  low desires turn you away from it so that you should perish;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And what is this in your right hand,
<br> O Musa!
<br>
<a name = "verse20_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.18</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> This is my staff:
<br> I recline on it and I beat the  leaves with it to make them fall upon my sheep,
<br> and I have other  uses for it.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.19</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Cast it down,
<br> O Musa!
<br>
<a name = "verse20_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.20</b>]
<br>
<br> So he cast it down;
<br> and lo!
<br> it was a serpent running.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.21</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Take hold of it and fear not;
<br> We will restore it to  its former state:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And press your hand to your side,
<br> it shall come out white  without evil:
<br> another sign:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.23</b>]
<br>
<br> That We may show you of Our greater signs:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Go to Firon,
<br> surely he has exceeded all limits.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.25</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> Expand my breast for me,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And make my affair easy to me,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And loose the knot from my tongue,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.28</b>]
<br>
<br> (That) they may understand my word;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And give to me an aider from my family:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Haroun,
<br> my brother,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Strengthen my back by him,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And associate him (with me) in my affair,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.33</b>]
<br>
<br> So that we should glorify Thee much,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And remember Thee oft.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely,
<br> Thou art seeing us.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.36</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> You are indeed granted your petition,
<br> O Musa    And certainly We bestowed on you a favor at another time;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.38</b>]
<br>
<br> When We revealed to your mother what was revealed;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Saying:
<br> Put him into a chest,
<br> then cast it down into the  river,
<br> then the river shall throw him on the shore;
<br> there shall  take him up one who is an enemy to Me and enemy to him,
<br> and I  cast down upon you love from Me,
<br> and that you might be brought up  before My eyes;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.40</b>]
<br>
<br> When your sister went and said:
<br> Shall I direct you to one who  will take charge of him?
<br> So We brought you back to your mother,
<br>  that her eye might be cooled and she should not grieve and you  killed a man,
<br> then We delivered you from the grief,
<br> and We tried  you with (a severe) trying.
<br> Then you stayed for years among the  people of Madyan;
<br> then you came hither as ordained,
<br> O Musa.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And I have chosen you for Myself:
<br>
<a name = "verse20_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Go you and your brother with My communications and be not  remiss in remembering Me;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Go both to Firon,
<br> surely he has become inordinate;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Then speak to him a gentle word haply he may mind or fear.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Both said:
<br> O our Lord!
<br> Surely we fear that he may hasten to  do evil to us or that he may become inordinate.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.46</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Fear not,
<br> surely I am with you both:
<br> I do hear and  see.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.47</b>]
<br>
<br> So go you both to him and say:
<br> Surely we are two apostles of  your Lord;
<br> therefore send the children of Israel with us and do  not torment them!
<br> Indeed we have brought to you a communication  from your Lord,
<br> and peace is on him who follows the guidance;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely it has been revealed to us that the chastisement will  surely come upon him who rejects and turns back.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.49</b>]
<br>
<br> (Firon) said:
<br> And who is your Lord,
<br> O Musa?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.50</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Our Lord is He Who gave to everything its creation,
<br>  then guided it (to its goal).
<br>
<a name = "verse20_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.51</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Then what is the state of the former generations?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.52</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a book,
<br> my  Lord errs not,
<br> nor does He forget;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.53</b>]
<br>
<br> Who made the earth for you an expanse and made for you  therein paths and sent down water from the cloud;
<br> then thereby We  have brought forth many species of various herbs.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Eat and pasture your cattle;
<br> most surely there are signs in  this for those endowed with understanding.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.55</b>]
<br>
<br> From it We created you and into it We shall send you back and  from it will We raise you a second time.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And truly We showed him Our signs,
<br> all of them,
<br> but he  rejected and refused.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Said he:
<br> Have you come to us that you should turn us out of  our land by your magic,
<br> O Musa?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.58</b>]
<br>
<br> So we too will produce before you magic like it,
<br> therefore  make between us and you an appointment,
<br> which we should not  break,
<br> (neither) we nor you,
<br> (in) a central place.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.59</b>]
<br>
<br> (Musa) said:
<br> Your appointment is the day of the Festival and  let the people be gathered together in the early forenoon.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.60</b>]
<br>
<br> So Firon turned his back and settled his plan,
<br> then came.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.61</b>]
<br>
<br> Musa said to them:
<br> Woe to you!
<br> do not forge a lie against  Allah,
<br> lest He destroy you by a punishment,
<br> and he who forges (a  lie) indeed fails to attain (his desire).
<br>
<a name = "verse20_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.62</b>]
<br>
<br> So they disputed with one another about their affair and kept  the discourse secret.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.63</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> These are most surely two magicians who wish to  turn you out from your land by their magic and to take away your  best traditions.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore settle your plan,
<br> then come standing in ranks and  he will prosper indeed this day who overcomes.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.65</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> will you cast,
<br> or shall we be the first  who cast down?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.66</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Nay!
<br> cast down.
<br> then lo!
<br> their cords and their  rods-- it was imaged to him on account of their magic as if they  were running.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.67</b>]
<br>
<br> So Musa conceived in his mind a fear.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.68</b>]
<br>
<br> We said:
<br> Fear not,
<br> surely you shall be the uppermost,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And cast down what is in your right hand;
<br> it shall devour  what they have wrought;
<br> they have wrought only the plan of a  magician,
<br> and the magician shall not be successful wheresoever he  may come from.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.70</b>]
<br>
<br> And the magicians were cast down making obeisance;
<br> they said:
<br>  We believe in the Lord of Haroun and Musa.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.71</b>]
<br>
<br> (Firon) said:
<br> You believe in him before I give you leave;
<br>  most surely he is the chief of you who taught you enchantment,
<br>  therefore I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on  opposite sides,
<br> and I will certainly crucify you on the trunks of  the palm trees,
<br> and certainly you will come to know which of us  is the more severe and the more abiding in chastising.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.72</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We do not prefer you to what has come to us of  clear arguments and to He Who made us,
<br> therefore decide what you  are going to decide;
<br> you can only decide about this world's life.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.73</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely we believe in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins  and the magic to which you compelled us;
<br> and Allah is better and  more abiding.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.74</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever comes to his Lord (being) guilty,
<br> for him is surely  hell;
<br> he shall not die therein,
<br> nor shall he live.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.75</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever comes to Him a believer (and) he has done good  deeds indeed,
<br> these it is who shall have the high ranks,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.76</b>]
<br>
<br> The gardens of perpetuity,
<br> beneath which rivers flow,
<br> to  abide therein;
<br> and this is the reward of him who has purified  himself.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.77</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We revealed to Musa,
<br> saying:
<br> Travel by night  with My servants,
<br> then make for them a dry path in the sea,
<br> not  fearing to be overtaken,
<br> nor being afraid.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon followed them with his armies,
<br> so there came upon  them of the sea that which came upon them.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.79</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon led astray his people and he did not guide (them)  aright.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.80</b>]
<br>
<br> O children of Israel!
<br> indeed We delivered you from your  enemy,
<br> and We made a covenant with you on the blessed side of the  mountain,
<br> and We sent to you the manna and the quails.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Eat of the good things We have given you for sustenance,
<br> and  be not inordinate with respect to them,
<br> lest My wrath should be  due to you,
<br> and to whomsoever My wrath is due be shall perish  indeed.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely I am most Forgiving to him who repents and  believes and does good,
<br> then continues to follow the right  direction.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.83</b>]
<br>
<br> And what caused you to hasten from your people,
<br> O Musa?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.84</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> They are here on my track and I hastened on to Thee,
<br>  my Lord,
<br> that Thou mightest be pleased.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.85</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> So surely We have tried your people after you,
<br> and  the Samiri has led them astray.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.86</b>]
<br>
<br> So Musa returned to his people wrathful,
<br> sorrowing.
<br> Said he:
<br>  O my people!
<br> did not your Lord promise you a goodly promise:
<br> did  then the time seem long to you,
<br> or did you wish that displeasure  from your Lord should be due to you,
<br> so that you broke (your)  promise to me?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.87</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We did not break (our) promise to you of our own  accord,
<br> but we were made to bear the burdens of the ornaments of  the people,
<br> then we made a casting of them,
<br> and thus did the  Samiri suggest.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.88</b>]
<br>
<br> So he brought forth for them a calf,
<br> a (mere) body,
<br> which had  a mooing sound,
<br> so they said:
<br> This is your god and the god of  Musa,
<br> but he forgot.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.89</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> could they not see that it did not return to them a  reply,
<br> and (that) it did not control any harm or benefit for  them?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.90</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly Haroun had said to them before:
<br> O my people!
<br>  you are only tried by it,
<br> and surely your Lord is the Beneficent  God,
<br> therefore follow me and obey my order.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.91</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We will by no means cease to keep to its worship  until Musa returns to us.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.92</b>]
<br>
<br> (Musa) said:
<br> O Haroun!
<br> what prevented you,
<br> when you saw them  going astray,
<br>
<a name = "verse20_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.93</b>]
<br>
<br> So that you did not follow me?
<br> Did you then disobey my order?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.94</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O son of my mother!
<br> seize me not by my beard nor by  my head;
<br> surely I was afraid lest you should say:
<br> You have caused  a division among the children of Israel and not waited for my  word.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.95</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> What was then your object,
<br> O Samiri?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.96</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I saw (Jibreel) what they did not see,
<br> so I took a  handful (of the dust) from the footsteps of the messenger,
<br> then I  threw it in the casting;
 thus did my soul commend to me<br>
<a name = "verse20_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.97</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Begone then,
<br> surely for you it will be in this life  to say,
<br> Touch (me) not;
<br> and surely there is a threat for you,
<br>  which shall not be made to fail to you,
<br> and look at your god to  whose worship you kept (so long);
<br> we will certainly burn it,
<br> then  we will certainly scatter it a (wide) scattering in the sea.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.98</b>]
<br>
<br> Your God is only Allah,
<br> there is no god but He;
<br> He  comprehends all things in (His) knowledge.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.99</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus do We relate to you (some) of the news of what has gone  before;
<br> and indeed We have given to you a Reminder from  Ourselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.100</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever turns aside from it,
 he shall surely bear a burden  on the day of resurrection<br>
<a name = "verse20_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.101</b>]
<br>
<br> Abiding in this (state),
<br> and evil will it be for them to  bear on the day of resurrection;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.102</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when the trumpet shall be blown,
<br> and We will  gather the guilty,
<br> blue-eyed,
 on that day<br>
<a name = "verse20_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.103</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall consult together secretly:
<br> You did tarry but ten  (centuries).
<br>
<a name = "verse20_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.104</b>]
<br>
<br> We know best what they say,
<br> when the fairest of them in  course would say:
<br> You tarried but a day.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.105</b>]
<br>
<br> And they ask you about the mountains.
<br> Say:
<br> My Lord will  carry them away from the roots.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.106</b>]
<br>
<br> Then leave it a plain,
 smooth level<br>
<a name = "verse20_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.107</b>]
<br>
<br> You shall not see therein any crookedness or unevenness.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.108</b>]
<br>
<br> On that day they shall follow the inviter,
<br> there is no  crookedness in him,
<br> and the voices shall be low before the  Beneficent God so that you shall not hear aught but a soft sound.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.109</b>]
<br>
<br> On that day shall no intercession avail except of him whom  the Beneficent God allows and whose word He is pleased with.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.110</b>]
<br>
<br> He knows what is before them and what is behind them,
<br> while  they do not comprehend it in knowledge.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.111</b>]
<br>
<br> And the faces shall be humbled before the Living,
<br> the  Self-subsistent God,
<br> and he who bears iniquity is indeed a  failure.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.112</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever does good works and he is a believer,
<br> he shall  have no fear of injustice nor of the withholding of his due.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_112"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.113</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus have We sent it down an Arabic Quran,
<br> and have  distinctly set forth therein of threats that they may guard  (against evil) or that it may produce a reminder for them.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_113"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.114</b>]
<br>
<br> Supremely exalted is therefore Allah,
<br> the King,
<br> the Truth,
<br>  and do not make haste with the Quran before its revelation is  made complete to you and say:
<br> O my Lord !
<br> increase me in  knowledge.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_114"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.115</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave a commandment to Adam before,
<br> but he  forgot;
<br> and We did not find in him any determination.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_115"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.116</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We said to the angels:
<br> Make obeisance to Adam,
<br> they  made obeisance,
<br> but Iblis (did it not);
<br> he refused.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_116"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.117</b>]
<br>
<br> So We said:
<br> O Adam!
<br> This is an enemy to you and to your  wife;
<br> therefore let him not drive you both forth from the garden  so that you should be unhappy;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_117"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.118</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely it is (ordained) for you that you shall not be hungry  therein nor bare of clothing;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_118"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.119</b>]
<br>
<br> And that you shall not be thirsty therein nor shall you feel  the heat of the sun.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_119"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.120</b>]
<br>
<br> But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to him;
<br> he said:
<br> O  Adam!
<br> Shall I guide you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom  which decays not?
<br>    121 .
<br> Then they both ate of it,
<br> so their evil inclinations became  manifest to them,
<br> and they both began to cover themselves with  leaves of the garden,
<br> and Adam disobeyed his Lord,
<br> so his life  became evil (to him).
<br>
<a name = "verse20_120"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.122</b>]
<br>
<br> Then his Lord chose him,
<br> so He turned to him and guided  (him).
<br>
<a name = "verse20_121"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.123</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Get forth you two therefrom,
<br> all (of you),
<br> one of  you (is) enemy to another.
<br> So there will surely come to you  guidance from Me,
<br> then whoever follows My guidance,
<br> he shall not  go astray nor be unhappy;
<br>
<a name = "verse20_122"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.124</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever turns away from My reminder,
<br> his shall be a  straitened life,
<br> and We will raise him on the day of  resurrection,
<br> blind.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_123"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.125</b>]
<br>
<br> He shall say:
<br> My Lord!
<br> why hast Thou raised me blind and I  was a seeing one indeed?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_124"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.126</b>]
<br>
<br> He will say:
<br> Even so,
<br> Our communications came to you but you  neglected them;
<br> even thus shall you be forsaken this day.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_125"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.127</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus do We recompense him who is extravagant and does  not believe in the communications of his Lord,
 and certainly the  chastisement of the hereafter is severer and more<br>
<a name = "verse20_126"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.128</b>]
<br>
<br> Does it not then direct them aright how many of the  generations In whose dwelling-places they go about We destroyed  before them?
<br> Most surely there are signs in this for those  endowed with understanding.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_127"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.129</b>]
<br>
<br> And had there not been a word (that had) already gone forth  from your Lord and an appointed term,
<br> it would surely have been  made to cleave (to them).
<br>
<a name = "verse20_128"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.130</b>]
<br>
<br> Bear then patiently what they say,
<br> and glorify your Lord by  the praising of Him before the rising of the sun and before its  setting,
<br> and during hours of the night do also glorify (Him) and  during parts of the day,
 that you may be well pleased<br>
<a name = "verse20_129"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.131</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not stretch your eyes after that with which We have  provided different classes of them,
<br> (of) the splendor of this  world's life,
<br> that We may thereby try them;
<br> and the sustenance  (given) by your Lord is better and more abiding.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_130"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.132</b>]
<br>
<br> And enjoin prayer on your followers,
<br> and steadily adhere to  it;
<br> We do not ask you for subsistence;
<br> We do give you  subsistence,
<br> and the (good) end is for guarding (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse20_131"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.133</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Why does he not bring to us a sign from his  Lord?
<br> Has not there come to them a clear evidence of what is m  the previous books?
<br>
<a name = "verse20_132"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.134</b>]
<br>
<br> And had We destroyed them with chastisement before this,
<br>  they would certainly have said:
<br> O our Lord!
<br> why didst Thou not  send to us an apostle,
<br> for then we should have followed Thy  communications before that we met disgrace and shame.
<br>
<a name = "verse20_133"></a>
<p>
[<b>20.135</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Every one (of us) is awaiting,
<br> therefore do await:
<br> So  you will come to know who is the follower of the even path and  who goes aright.
