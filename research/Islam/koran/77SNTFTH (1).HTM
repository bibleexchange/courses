<p><h3>Book 77</h3>
<br><h3>The Sent Forth</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> tho Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse77_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.1</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the emissary winds,
<br> sent one after another  (for men's benefit),
<br>
<a name = "verse77_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.2</b>]
<br>
<br> By the raging hurricanes,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Which scatter clouds to their destined places,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Then separate them one from another,
  <br>
<a name = "verse77_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Then I swear by the angels who bring down the revelation,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.6</b>]
<br>
<br> To clear or to warn.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely what you are threatened with must come to  pass.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.8</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the stars are made to lose their light,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the heaven is rent asunder,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the mountains are carried away as dust,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the apostles are gathered at their appointed  time    li.
<br> To what day is the doom fixed?
<br>
<a name = "verse77_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.13</b>]
<br>
<br> To the day of decision.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And what will make you comprehend what the day of  decision is?
<br>
<a name = "verse77_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Did We not destroy the former generations?
<br>    17 Then did We follow them up with later ones.
<br>    18 Even thus shall We deal with the guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Did We not create you from contemptible water?
<br>
<a name = "verse77_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We placed it in a secure resting-place,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Till an appointed term,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.23</b>]
<br>
<br> So We proportion it-- how well are We at proportioning  (things).
<br>
<a name = "verse77_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Have We not made the earth to draw together to itself,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.26</b>]
<br>
<br> The living and the dead,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And made therein lofty mountains,
<br> and given you to drink  of sweet water?
<br>
<a name = "verse77_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Walk on to that which you called a lie.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Walk on to the covering having three branches,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Neither having the coolness of the shade nor availing  against the flame.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely it sends up sparks like palaces,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.33</b>]
<br>
<br> As if they were tawny camels.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.35</b>]
<br>
<br> This is the day on which they shall not speak,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And permission shall not be given to them so that they  should offer excuses.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.38</b>]
<br>
<br> This is the day of decision:
<br> We have gathered you and  those of yore.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.39</b>]
<br>
<br> So if you have a plan,
<br> plan against Me (now).
<br>
<a name = "verse77_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be amid  shades and fountains,
<br>
<a name = "verse77_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And fruits such as they desire.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Eat and drink pleasantly because of what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely thus do We reward the doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little;
<br> surely you are  guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And where it is said to them:
<br> Bow down,
<br> they do not bow  down.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse77_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>77.50</b>]
<br>
<br> In what announcement,
<br> then,
<br> after it,
<br> will they believe?
