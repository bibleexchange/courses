<p><h3>Book 79</h3>
<br><h3>The Draggers</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse79_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.1</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the angels who violently pull out the souls of  the wicked,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And by those who gently draw out the souls of the  blessed,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And by those who float in space,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Then those who are foremost going ahead,
  <br>
<a name = "verse79_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Then those who regulate the affair.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.6</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which the quaking one shall quake,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.7</b>]
<br>
<br> What must happen afterwards shall follow it.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Hearts on that day shall palpitate,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Their eyes cast down.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.10</b>]
<br>
<br> They say:
<br> Shall we indeed be restored to (our) first  state?
<br>
<a name = "verse79_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.11</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> when we are rotten bones?
<br>
<a name = "verse79_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.12</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> That then would be a return occasioning loss.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.13</b>]
<br>
<br> But it shall be only a single cry,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.14</b>]
<br>
<br> When lo!
<br> they shall be wakeful.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Has not there come to you the story of Musa?
<br>
<a name = "verse79_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.16</b>]
<br>
<br> When his Lord called upon him in the holy valley,
<br> twice,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Go to Firon,
<br> surely he has become inordinate.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Then say:
<br> Have you (a desire) to purify yourself:
<br>
<a name = "verse79_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And I will guide you to your Lord so that you should  fear.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.20</b>]
<br>
<br> So he showed him the mighty sign.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.21</b>]
<br>
<br> But he rejected (the truth) and disobeyed.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he went back hastily.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he gathered (men) and called out.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he said:
<br> I am your lord,
<br> the most high.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.25</b>]
<br>
<br> So Allah seized him with the punishment of the hereafter  and the former life.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is in this a lesson to him who fears.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Are you the harder to create or the heaven?
<br> He made it.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.28</b>]
<br>
<br> He raised high its height,
<br> then put it into a right good  state.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And He made dark its night and brought out its light.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And the earth,
<br> He expanded it after that.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.31</b>]
<br>
<br> He brought forth from it its water and its pasturage.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And the mountains,
<br> He made them firm,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.33</b>]
<br>
<br> A provision for you and for your cattle.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.34</b>]
<br>
<br> But when the great predominating calamity comes;
<br>
<a name = "verse79_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.35</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which man shall recollect what he strove  after,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.36</b>]
<br>
 And the hell shall be made manifest to him who sees<br>
<a name = "verse79_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Then as for him who is inordinate,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And prefers the life of this world,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Then surely the hell,
<br> that is the abode.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for him who fears to stand in the presence of his  Lord and forbids the soul from low desires,
<br>
<a name = "verse79_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Then surely the garden-- that is the abode.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.42</b>]
<br>
<br> They ask you about the hour,
<br> when it will come.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.43</b>]
<br>
<br> About what!
<br> You are one to remind of it.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.44</b>]
<br>
<br> To your Lord is the goal of it.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.45</b>]
<br>
<br> You are only a warner to him who would fear it.
<br>
<a name = "verse79_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>79.46</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day that they see it,
<br> it will be as though they  had not tarried but the latter part of a day or the early  part of it.
