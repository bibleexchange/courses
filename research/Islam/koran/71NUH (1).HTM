<p><h3>Book 71</h3>
<br><h3>Nuh</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse71_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We sent Nuh to his people,
<br> saying:
<br> Warn your  people before there come upon them a painful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse71_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.2</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my people!
<br> Surely I am a plain warner to you:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.3</b>]
<br>
<br> That you should serve Allah and be careful of (your duty  to) Him and obey me:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.4</b>]
<br>
<br> He will forgive you some of your faults and grant you a  delay to an appointed term;
<br> surely the term of Allah when it  comes is not postponed;
<br> did you but know!
  <br>
<a name = "verse71_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  He said:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> surely I have called my people by  night and by day!
<br>
<a name = "verse71_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.6</b>]
<br>
<br> But my call has only made them flee the more:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And whenever I have called them that Thou mayest forgive  them,
<br> they put their fingers in their ears,
<br> cover themselves  with their garments,
<br> and persist and are puffed up with  pride:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Then surely I called to them aloud:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Then surely I spoke to them in public and I spoke to them  in secret:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Then I said,
<br> Ask forgiveness of your Lord,
<br> surely He is  the most Forgiving:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.11</b>]
<br>
<br> He will send down upon you the cloud,
<br> pouring down  abundance of rain:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And help you with wealth and sons,
<br> and make for you  gardens,
<br> and make for you rivers.
<br>
<a name = "verse71_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.13</b>]
<br>
<br> What is the matter with you that you fear not the  greatness of Allah?
<br>
<a name = "verse71_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And indeed He has created you through various grades:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens  ,
<br> one above another,
<br>
<a name = "verse71_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And made the moon therein a light,
<br> and made the sun a  lamp?
<br>
<a name = "verse71_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has made you grow out of the earth as a  growth:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Then He returns you to it,
<br> then will He bring you forth  a (new) bringing forth:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has made for you the earth a wide expanse,
<br>
<a name = "verse71_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.20</b>]
<br>
<br> That you may go along therein in wide paths.
<br>
<a name = "verse71_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Nuh said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> surely they have disobeyed me and  followed him whose wealth and children have added to him  nothing but loss.
<br>
<a name = "verse71_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And they have planned a very great plan.
<br>
<a name = "verse71_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> By no means leave your gods,
<br> nor leave  Wadd,
<br> nor Suwa;
<br> nor Yaghus,
<br> and Yauq and Nasr.
<br>
<a name = "verse71_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And indeed they have led astray many,
<br> and do not  increase the unjust in aught but error.
<br>
<a name = "verse71_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Because of their wrongs they were drowned,
<br> then made to  enter fire,
<br> so they did not find any helpers besides Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse71_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And Nuh said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> leave not upon the land any  dweller from among the unbelievers:
<br>
<a name = "verse71_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.27</b>]
<br>
<br> For surely if Thou leave them they will lead astray Thy  servants,
<br> and will not beget any but immoral,
 ungrateful  (children)<br>
<a name = "verse71_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>71.28</b>]
<br>
<br> My Lord!
<br> forgive me and my parents and him who enters my  house believing,
<br> and the believing men and the believing  women;
<br> and do not increase the unjust in aught but  destruction!
