<p><h3>Book 12</h3>
<br><h3>Yusuf</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse12_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Ra.
<br> These are the verses of the Book that makes  (things) manifest.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have revealed it-- an Arabic Quran-- that you may  understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.3</b>]
<br>
<br> We narrate to you the best of narratives,
<br> by Our  revealing to you this Quran,
<br> though before this you were  certainly one of those who did not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.4</b>]
<br>
<br> When Yusuf said to his father:
<br> O my father!
<br> surely I saw  eleven stars and the sun and the moon-- I saw them making  obeisance to me.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.5</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my son!
<br> do not relate your vision to your  brothers,
<br> lest they devise a plan against you;
<br> surely the  Shaitan is an open enemy to man.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the  interpretation of sayings and make His favor complete to you  and to the children of Yaqoub,
<br> as He made it complete before  to your fathers,
<br> Ibrahim and Ishaq;
<br> surely your Lord is  Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly in Yusuf and his brothers there are signs for  the inquirers.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.8</b>]
<br>
<br> When they said:
<br> Certainly Yusuf and his brother are  dearer to our father than we,
<br> though we are a (stronger)  company;
<br> most surely our father is in manifest error:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Slay Yusuf or cast him (forth) into some land,
<br> so that  your father's regard may be exclusively for you,
<br> and after  that you may be a righteous people.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.10</b>]
<br>
<br> A speaker from among them said:
<br> Do not slay Yusuf,
<br> and  cast him down into the bottom of the pit if you must do  (it),
<br> (so that) some of the travellers may pick him up.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.11</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O our father!
<br> what reason have you that you  do not trust in us with respect to Yusuf?
<br> And most surely we  are his sincere well-wishers:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and  sport,
<br> and surely we will guard him well.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.13</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely it grieves me that you should take him  off,
<br> and I fear lest the wolf devour him while you are  heedless of him.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.14</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Surely if the wolf should devour him  notwithstanding that we are a (strong) company,
<br> we should  then certainly be losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.15</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they had gone off with him and agreed that they  should put him down at the bottom of the pit,
<br> and We  revealed to him:
<br> You will most certainly inform them of this  their affair while they do not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And they came to their father at nightfall,
<br> weeping.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.17</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O our father!
<br> surely we went off racing and  left Yusuf by our goods,
<br> so the wolf devoured him,
<br> and you  will not believe us though we are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it.
<br> He  said:
<br> Nay,
<br> your souls have made the matter light for you,
<br>  but patience is good and Allah is He Whose help is sought  for against what you describe.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And there came travellers and they sent their  water-drawer and he let down his bucket.
<br> He said:
<br> O good  news!
<br> this is a youth;
<br> and they concealed him as an article  of merchandise,
<br> and Allah knew what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And they sold him for a small price,
<br> a few pieces of  silver,
<br> and they showed no desire for him.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife:
<br> Give  him an honorable abode,
<br> maybe he will be useful to us,
<br> or we  may adopt him as a son.
<br> And thus did We establish Yusuf in  the land and that We might teach him the interpretation of  sayings;
<br> and Allah is the master of His affair,
<br> but most  people do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And when he had attained his maturity,
<br> We gave him  wisdom and knowledge:
<br> and thus do We reward those who do  good.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And she in whose house he was sought to make himself  yield (to her),
<br> and she made fast the doors and said:
<br> Come  forward.
<br> He said:
<br> I seek Allah's refuge,
<br> surely my Lord made  good my abode:
<br> Surely the unjust do not prosper.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly she made for him,
<br> and he would have made  for her,
<br> were it not that he had seen the manifest evidence  of his Lord;
<br> thus (it was) that We might turn away from him  evil and indecency,
<br> surely he was one of Our sincere  servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And they both hastened to the door,
<br> and she rent his  shirt from behind and they met her husband at the door.
<br> She  said:
<br> What is the punishment of him who intends evil to your  wife except imprisonment or a painful chastisement?
<br>
<a name = "verse12_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.26</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> She sought to make me yield (to her);
<br> and a  witness of her own family bore witness:
<br> If his shirt is rent  from front,
<br> she speaks the truth and he is one of the liars:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And if his shirt is rent from behind,
<br> she tells a lie  and he is one of the truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.28</b>]
<br>
<br> So when he saw his shirt rent from behind,
<br> he said:
<br>  Surely it is a guile of you women;
<br> surely your guile is  great:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.29</b>]
<br>
<br> O Yusuf!
<br> turn aside from this;
<br> and (O my wife)!
<br> ask  forgiveness for your fault,
<br> surely you are one of the  wrong-doers.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And women in the city said:
<br> The chiefs wife seeks her  slave to yield himself (to her),
<br> surely he has affected her  deeply with (his) love;
<br> most surely we see her in manifest  error.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.31</b>]
<br>
<br> So when she heard of their sly talk she sent for them  and prepared for them a repast,
<br> and gave each of them a  knife,
<br> and said (to Yusuf):
<br> Come forth to them.
<br> So when they  saw him,
<br> they deemed him great,
<br> and cut their hands (in  amazement),
<br> and said:
<br> Remote is Allah (from inperfection);
<br>  this is not a mortal;
<br> this is but a noble angel.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.32</b>]
<br>
<br> She said:
<br> This is he with respect to whom you blamed me,
<br>  and certainly I sought his yielding himself (to me),
<br> but he  abstained,
<br> and if he does not do what I bid him,
<br> he shall  certainly be imprisoned,
<br> and he shall certainly be of those  who are in a state of ignominy.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.33</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> the prison house is dearer to me than  that to which they invite me;
<br> and if Thou turn not away  their device from me,
<br> I will yearn towards them and become  (one) of the ignorant.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Thereupon his Lord accepted his prayer and turned away  their guile from him;
<br> surely He is the Hearing,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Then it occurred to them after they had seen the signs  that they should imprison him till a time.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And two youths entered the prison with him.
<br> One of them  said:
<br> I saw myself pressing wine.
<br> And the other said:
<br> I saw  myself carrying bread on my head,
<br> of which birds ate.
<br> Inform  us of its interpretation;
<br> surely we see you to be of the  doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.37</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> There shall not come to you the food with which  you are fed,
<br> but I will inform you both of its  interpretation before it comes to you;
<br> this is of what my  Lord has taught me;
<br> surely I have forsaken the religion of a  people who do not believe in Allah,
<br> and they are deniers of  the hereafter:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And I follow the religion of my fathers,
<br> Ibrahim and  Ishaq and Yaqoub;
<br> it beseems us not that we should associate  aught with Allah;
<br> this is by Allah's grace upon us and on  mankind,
<br> but most people do not give thanks:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.39</b>]
<br>
<br> O my two mates of the prison!
<br> are sundry lords better or  Allah the One,
<br> the Supreme?
<br>
<a name = "verse12_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.40</b>]
<br>
<br> You do not serve besides Him but names which you have  named,
<br> you and your fathers;
<br> Allah has not sent down any  authority for them;
<br> judgment is only Allah's;
<br> He has  commanded that you shall not serve aught but Him;
<br> this is  the right religion but most people do not know:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.41</b>]
<br>
<br> O my two mates of the prison!
<br> as for one of you,
<br> he  shall give his lord to drink wine;
<br> and as for the other,
<br> he  shall be crucified,
<br> so that the birds shall eat from his  head,
<br> the matter is decreed concerning which you inquired.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And he said to him whom he knew would be delivered of  the two:
<br> Remember me with your lord;
<br> but the Shaitan caused  him to forget mentioning (it) to his lord,
<br> so he remained in  the prison a few years.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And the king said:
<br> Surely I see seven fat kine which  seven lean ones devoured;
<br> and seven green ears and (seven)  others dry:
<br> O chiefs!
<br> explain to me my dream,
<br> if you can  interpret the dream.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.44</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Confused dreams,
<br> and we do not know.
<br>the  interpretation of dreams.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And of the two (prisoners) he who had found deliverance  and remembered after a long time said:
<br> I will inform you of  its interpretation,
<br> so let me go:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Yusuf!
<br> O truthful one!
<br> explain to us seven fat kine  which seven lean ones devoured,
<br> and seven green ears and  (seven) others dry,
<br> that I may go back to the people so that  they may know.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.47</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> You shall sow for seven years continuously,
<br>  then what you reap leave it in its ear except a little of  which you eat.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Then there shall come after that seven years of hardship  which shall eat away all that you have beforehand laid up in  store for them,
<br> except a little of what you shall have  preserved:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Then there will come after that a year in which people  shall have rain and in which they shall press (grapes).
<br>
<a name = "verse12_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And the king said:
<br> Bring him to me.
<br> So when the  messenger came to him,
<br> he said:
<br> Go back to your lord and ask  him,
<br> what is the case of the women who cut their hands;
<br>  surely my Lord knows their guile.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.51</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> How was your affair when you sought Yusuf to  yield himself (to you)?
<br> They said:
<br> Remote is Allah (from  imperfection),
<br> we knew of no evil on his part.
<br> The chief's  wife said:
<br> Now has the truth become established:
<br> I sought  him to yield himself (to me),
<br> and he is most surely of the  truthful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.52</b>]
<br>
<br> This is that he might know that I have not been  unfaithful to him in secret and that Allah does not guide  the device of the unfaithful.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And I do not declare myself free,
<br> most surely (man's)  self is wont to command (him to do) evil,
<br> except such as my  Lord has had mercy on,
<br> surely my Lord is Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And the king said:
<br> Bring him to me,
<br> I will choose him  for myself.
<br> So when he had spoken with him,
<br> he said:
<br> Surely  you are in our presence today an honorable,
<br> a faithful one.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.55</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Place me (in authority) over the treasures of  the land,
<br> surely I am a good keeper,
<br> knowing well.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus did We give to Yusuf power in the land-- he had  mastery in it wherever he liked;
<br> We send down Our mercy on  whom We please,
<br> and We do not waste the reward of those who  do good.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly the reward of the hereafter is much better  for those who believe and guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse12_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And Yusuf's brothers came and went in to him,
<br> and he  knew them,
<br> while they did not recognize him.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And when he furnished them with their provision,
<br> he  said:
<br> Bring to me a brother of yours from your father;
<br> do  you not see that I give full measure and that I am the best  of hosts?
<br>
<a name = "verse12_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.60</b>]
<br>
<br> But if you do not bring him to me,
<br> you shall have no  measure (of corn) from me,
<br> nor shall you come near me.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.61</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We will strive to make his father yield in  respect of him,
<br> and we are sure to do (it).
<br>
<a name = "verse12_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.62</b>]
<br>
<br> And he said to his servants:
<br> Put their money into their  bags that they may recognize it when they go back to their  family,
<br> so that they may come back.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.63</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they returned to their father,
<br> they said:
<br> O our  father,
<br> the measure is withheld from us,
<br> therefore send with  us our brother,
<br> (so that) we may get the measure,
<br> and we  will most surely guard him.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.64</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I cannot trust in you with respect to him,
<br>  except as I trusted in you with respect to his brother  before;
<br> but Allah is the best Keeper,
<br> and He is the most  Merciful of the merciful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they opened their goods,
<br> they found their money  returned to them.
<br> They said:
<br> O our father!
<br> what (more) can  we desire?
<br> This is our property returned to us,
<br> and we will  bring corn for our family and guard our brother,
<br> and will  have in addition the measure of a camel (load);
<br> this is an  easy measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.66</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I will by no means send him with you until you  give me a firm covenant in Allah's name that you will most  certainly bring him back to me,
<br> unless you are completely  surrounded.
<br> And when they gave him their covenant,
<br> he said:
<br>  Allah is the One in Whom trust is placed as regards what we  say.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And he said:
<br> O my sons !
<br> do not (all) enter by one gate  and enter by different gates and I cannot avail you aught  against Allah;
<br> judgment is only Allah's;
<br> on Him do I rely,
<br>  and on Him let those who are reliant rely.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they had entered as their father had bidden  them,
<br> it did not avail them aught against Allah,
<br> but (it was  only) a desire in the soul of Yaqoub which he satisfied;
<br> and  surely he was possessed of knowledge because We had given  him knowledge,
<br> but most people do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they went in to Yusuf.
<br> he lodged his brother  with himself,
<br> saying:
<br> I am your brother,
<br> therefore grieve  not at what they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.70</b>]
<br>
<br> So when he furnished them with their provisions,
<br>  (someone) placed the drinking cup in his brother's bag.
<br> Then  a crier cried out:
<br> O caravan!
<br> you are most surely thieves.
<br>    71 .
<br> They said while they were facing them:
<br> What is it that  you miss?
<br>
<a name = "verse12_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.72</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We miss the king's drinking cup,
<br> and he who  shall bring it shall have a camel-load and I am responsible  for it.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.73</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> By Allah!
<br> you know for certain that we have  not come to make mischief in the land,
<br> and we are not  thieves.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.74</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> But what shall be the requital of this,
<br> if  you are liars?
<br>
<a name = "verse12_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.75</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> The requital of this is that the person in  whose bag it is found shall himself be (held for) the  satisfaction thereof;
<br> thus do we punish the wrongdoers.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.76</b>]
<br>
<br> So he began with their sacks before the sack of his  brother,
<br> then he brought it out from his brother's sack.
<br>  Thus did We plan for the sake of Yusuf;
<br> it was not (lawful)  that he should take his brother under the king's law unless  Allah pleased;
<br> We raise the degrees of whomsoever We please,
<br>  and above every one possessed of knowledge is the  All-knowing one.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.77</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> If he steal,
<br> a brother of his did indeed  steal before;
<br> but Yusuf kept it secret in his heart and did  not disclose it to them.
<br> He said:
<br> You are in an evil  condition and Allah knows best what you state.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.78</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O chief!
<br> he has a father,
<br> a very old man,
<br>  therefore retain one of us in his stead;
<br> surely we see you  to be of the doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.79</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Allah protect us that we should seize other  than him with whom we found our property,
<br> for then most  surely we would be unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.80</b>]
<br>
<br> Then when they despaired of him,
<br> they retired,
<br>  conferring privately together.
<br> The eldest of them said:
<br> Do  you not know that your father took from you a covenant in  Allah's name,
<br> and how you fell short of your duty with  respect to Yusuf before?
<br> Therefore I will by no means depart  from this land until my father permits me or Allah decides  for me,
<br> and He is the best of the judges:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Go back to your father and say:
<br> O our father!
<br> surely  your son committed theft,
<br> and we do not bear witness except  to what we have known,
<br> and we could not keep watch over the  unseen:
<br>
<a name = "verse12_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And inquire in the town in which we were and the caravan  with which we proceeded,
<br> and most surely we are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.83</b>]
<br>
<br> He (Yaqoub) said:
<br> Nay,
<br> your souls have made a matter  light for you,
<br> so patience is good;
<br> maybe Allah will bring  them all together to me;
<br> surely He is the Knowing,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.84</b>]
<br>
<br> And he turned away from them,
<br> and said:
<br> O my sorrow for  Yusuf!
<br> and his eyes became white on account of the grief,
<br>  and he was a repressor (of grief).
<br>
<a name = "verse12_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.85</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> By Allah!
<br> you will not cease to remember  Yusuf until you are a prey to constant disease or (until)  you are of those who perish.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.86</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I only complain of my grief and sorrow to  Allah,
<br> and I know from Allah what you do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.87</b>]
<br>
<br> O my sons!
<br> Go and inquire respecting Yusuf and his  brother,
<br> and despair not of Allah's mercy;
<br> surely none  despairs of Allah's mercy except the unbelieving people.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.88</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they came in to him,
<br> they said:
<br> O chief!
<br>  distress has afflicted us and our family and we have brought  scanty money,
<br> so give us full measure and be charitable to  us;
<br> surely Allah rewards the charitable.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.89</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Do you know how you treated Yusuf and his  brother when you were ignorant?
<br>
<a name = "verse12_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.90</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Are you indeed Yusuf?
<br> He said:
<br> I am Yusuf and  this is my brother;
<br> Allah has indeed been gracious to us;
<br>  surely he who guards (against evil) and is patient (is  rewarded) for surely Allah does not waste the reward of  those who do good.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.91</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> By Allah!
<br> now has Allah certainly chosen you  over us,
<br> and we were certainly sinners.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.92</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> (There shall be) no reproof against you this  day;
<br> Allah may forgive you,
<br> and He is the most Merciful of  the merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.93</b>]
<br>
<br> Take this my shirt and cast it on my father's face,
<br> he  will (again) be able to see,
<br> and come to me with all your  families.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.94</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the caravan had departed,
<br> their father said:
<br>  Most surely I perceive the greatness of Yusuf,
<br> unless you  pronounce me to be weak in judgment.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.95</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> By Allah,
<br> you are most surely in your old  error.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.96</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the bearer of good news came he cast it on his  face,
<br> so forthwith he regained his sight.
<br> He said:
<br> Did I not  say to you that I know from Allah what you do not know?
<br>
<a name = "verse12_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.97</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O our father!
<br> ask forgiveness of our faults  for us,
<br> surely we were sinners.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.98</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I will ask for you forgiveness from my Lord;
<br>  surely He is the Forgiving,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.99</b>]
<br>
<br> Then when they came in to Yusuf,
<br> he took his parents to  lodge with him and said:
<br> Enter safe into Egypt,
<br> if Allah  please.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.100</b>]
<br>
<br> And he raised his parents upon the throne and they fell  down in prostration before him,
<br> and he said:
<br> O my father!
<br>  this is the significance of my vision of old;
<br> my Lord has  indeed made it to be true;
<br> and He was indeed kind to me when  He brought me forth from the prison and brought you from the  desert after the Shaitan had sown dissensions between me and  my brothers,
<br> surely my Lord is benignant to whom He pleases;
<br>  surely He is the Knowing,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.101</b>]
<br>
<br> My Lord!
<br> Thou hast given me of the kingdom and taught  me of the interpretation of sayings:
<br> Originator of the  heavens and the earth!
<br> Thou art my guardian in this world  and the hereafter;
<br> make me die a muslim and join me with the  good.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.102</b>]
<br>
<br> This is of the announcements relating to the unseen  (which) We reveal to you,
<br> and you were not with them when  they resolved upon their affair,
<br> and they were devising  plans.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.103</b>]
<br>
<br> And most men will not believe though you desire it  eagerly.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.104</b>]
<br>
<br> And you do not ask them for a reward for this;
<br> it is  nothing but a reminder for all mankind.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.105</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth which  they pass by,
<br> yet they turn aside from it.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.106</b>]
<br>
<br> And most of them do not believe in Allah without  associating others (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse12_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.107</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they then feel secure that there may come to them an  extensive chastisement from Allah or (that) the hour may  come to them suddenly while they do not perceive?
<br>
<a name = "verse12_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.108</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> This is my way:
<br> I call to Allah,
<br> I and those who  follow me being certain,
<br> and glory be to Allah,
<br> and I am not  one of the polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.109</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have not sent before you but men from (among)  the people of the towns,
<br> to whom We sent revelations.
<br> Have  they not then travelled in the land and seen what was the  end of those before them?
<br> And certainly the abode of the  hereafter is best for those who guard (against evil);
<br> do you  not then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse12_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.110</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when the apostles despaired and the people became  sure that they were indeed told a lie,
<br> Our help came to them  and whom We pleased was delivered;
<br> and Our punishment is not  averted from the guilty people.
<br>
<a name = "verse12_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>12.111</b>]
<br>
<br> In their histories there is certainly a lesson for men  of understanding.
<br> It is not a narrative which could be  forged,
<br> but a verification of what is before it and a  distinct explanation of all things and a guide and a mercy  to a people who believe.
