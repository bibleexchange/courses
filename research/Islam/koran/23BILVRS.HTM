<p><h3>Book 23</h3>
<br><h3>The Believers</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse23_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Successful indeed are the believers,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Who are humble in their prayers,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And who keep aloof from what is vain,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And who are givers of poor-rate,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And who guard their private parts,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Except before their mates or those whom their right hands  possess,
<br> for they surely are not blameable,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.7</b>]
<br>
<br> But whoever seeks to go beyond that,
<br> these are they that  exceed the limits;
<br>
<a name = "verse23_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who are keepers of their trusts and their  covenant,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who keep a guard on their prayers;
<br>
<a name = "verse23_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.10</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they who are the heirs,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Who shall inherit the Paradise;
<br> they shall abide  therein.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We created man of an extract of clay,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We made him a small seed in a firm resting-place,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We made the seed a clot,
<br> then We made the clot a  lump of flesh,
<br> then We made (in) the lump of flesh bones,
<br>  then We clothed the bones with flesh,
<br> then We caused it to  grow into another creation,
<br> so blessed be Allah,
<br> the best of  the creators.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Then after that you will most surely die.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Then surely on the day of resurrection you shall be  raised.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We made above you seven heavens;
<br> and never  are We heedless of creation.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And We send down water from the cloud according to a  measure,
<br> then We cause it to settle in the earth,
<br> and most  surely We are able to carry it away.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We cause to grow thereby gardens of palm trees and  grapes for you;
<br> you have in them many fruits and from them  do you eat;
<br>
<a name = "verse23_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And a tree that grows out of Mount Sinai which produces  oil and a condiment for those who eat.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle:
<br>  We make you to drink of what is in their bellies,
<br> and you  have in them many advantages and of them you eat,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And on them and on the ships you are borne.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent Nuh to his people,
<br> and he said:
<br> O  my people!
<br> serve Allah,
<br> you have no god other than Him;
<br> will  you not then guard (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his  people said:
<br> He is nothing but a mortal like yourselves who  desires that he may have superiority over you,
<br> and if Allah  had pleased,
<br> He could certainly have sent down angels.
<br> We  have not heard of this among our fathers of yore:
<br>
<a name = "verse23_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.25</b>]
<br>
<br> He is only a madman,
<br> so bear with him for a time.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.26</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> help me against their calling me a  liar.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.27</b>]
<br>
<br> So We revealed to him,
<br> saying:
<br> Make the ark before Our  eyes and (according to) Our revelation;
<br> and when Our command  is given and the valley overflows,
<br> take into it of every  kind a pair,
<br> two,
<br> and your followers,
<br> except those among  them against whom the word has gone forth,
<br> and do not speak  to Me in respect of those who are unjust;
<br> surely they shall  be drowned.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you are firmly seated,
<br> you and those with you,
<br>  in the ark,
<br> say:
<br> All praise is due to Allah who delivered us  from the unjust people:
<br>
<a name = "verse23_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And say:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> cause me to disembark a blessed  alighting,
<br> and Thou art the best to cause to alight.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there are signs in this,
<br> and most surely We  are ever trying (men).
<br>
<a name = "verse23_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We raised up after them another generation.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.32</b>]
<br>
<br> So We sent among them an apostle from among them,
<br>  saying:
<br> Serve Allah,
<br> you have no god other than Him;
<br> will  you not then guard (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and called  the meeting of the hereafter a lie,
<br> and whom We had given  plenty to enjoy in this world's life,
<br> said:
<br> This is nothing  but a mortal like yourselves,
<br> eating of what you eat from  and drinking of what you drink.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you obey a mortal like yourselves,
<br> then most  surely you will be losers:
<br>
<a name = "verse23_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.35</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> does he threaten you that when you are dead and  become dust and bones that you shall then be brought forth?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Far,
<br> far is that which you are threatened with.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.37</b>]
<br>
<br> There is n.
<br>aught but our life in this world;
<br> we die and  we live and we shall not be raised again.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.38</b>]
<br>
<br> He is naught but a man who has forged a lie against  Allah,
<br> and we are not going to believe in him.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.39</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> help me against their calling me a  liar.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.40</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> In a little while they will most certainly be  repenting.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.41</b>]
<br>
<br> So the punishment overtook them in justice,
<br> and We made  them as rubbish;
<br> so away with the unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We raised after them other generations.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.43</b>]
<br>
<br> No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone  (it).
<br>
<a name = "verse23_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We sent Our apostles one after another;
<br> whenever  there came to a people their apostle,
<br> they called him a  liar,
<br> so We made some of them follow others and We made them  stories;
<br> so away with a people who do not believe!
<br>
<a name = "verse23_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We sent Musa and his brother Haroun,
<br> with Our  communications and a clear authority,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.46</b>]
<br>
<br> To Firon and his chiefs,
<br> but they behaved haughtily and  they were an insolent people.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And they said:
<br> What!
<br> shall we believe in two mortals  like ourselves while their people serve us?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.48</b>]
<br>
<br> So they rejected them and became of those who were  destroyed.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave Musa the Book that they may follow  a right direction.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made the son of Marium and his mother a sign,
<br> and  We gave them a shelter on a lofty ground having meadows and  springs.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.51</b>]
<br>
<br> O apostles!
<br> eat of the good things and do good;
<br> surely I  know what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely this your religion is one religion and I am  your Lord,
<br> therefore be careful (of your duty) to Me.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.53</b>]
<br>
<br> But they cut off their religion among themselves into  sects,
<br> each part rejoicing in that which is with them.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.54</b>]
<br>
 Therefore leave them in their overwhelming ignorance  till<br>
<a name = "verse23_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they think that by what We aid them with of wealth  and children,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.56</b>]
<br>
<br> We are hastening to them of good things?
<br> Nay,
<br> they do  not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they who from fear of their Lord are cautious,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who believe in the communications of their  Lord,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who do not associate (aught) with their Lord,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who give what they give.
<br>(in alms) while their  hearts are full of fear that to their Lord they must return,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.61</b>]
<br>
<br> These hasten to good things and they are foremost in  (attaining) them.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.62</b>]
<br>
<br> And We do not lay on any soul a burden except to the  extent of its ability,
<br> and with Us is a book which speaks  the truth,
<br> and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> their hearts are in overwhelming ignorance with  respect to it and they have besides this other deeds which  they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when We overtake those who lead easy lives among  them with punishment,
<br> lo!
<br> they cry for succor.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Cry not for succor this day;
<br> surely you shall not be  given help from Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.66</b>]
<br>
<br> My communications were indeed recited to you,
<br> but you  used to turn back on your heels,
<br>
<a name = "verse23_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.67</b>]
<br>
<br> In arrogance;
<br> talking nonsense about the Quran,
<br> and left  him like one telling fables by night.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.68</b>]
<br>
<br> Is it then that they do not ponder over what is said,
<br> or  is it that there has come to them that which did not come to  their fathers of old?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Or is it that they have not recognized their Apostle,
<br> so  that they deny him?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.70</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they say:
<br> There is madness in him?
<br> Nay!
<br> he has  brought them the truth,
<br> and most of them are averse from the  truth.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And should the truth follow their low desires,
<br> surely  the heavens and the earth and all those who are therein  would have perished.
<br> Nay!
<br> We have brought to them their  reminder,
<br> but from their reminder they turn aside.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.72</b>]
<br>
<br> Or is it that you ask them a recompense?
<br> But the  recompense of your Lord is best,
<br> and He is the best of those  who provide sustenance.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely you invite them to a right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely those who do not believe in the  hereafter are deviating from the way.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.75</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We show mercy to them and remove the distress  they have,
<br> they would persist in their inordinacy,
<br> blindly  wandering on.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.76</b>]
<br>
<br> And already We overtook them with chastisement,
<br> but they  were not submissive to their Lord,
<br> nor do they humble  themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.77</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when We open upon them a door of severe  chastisement,
<br> lo!
<br> they are in despair at it.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who made for you the ears and the eyes and  the hearts;
<br> little is it that you give thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.79</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who multiplied you in the earth,
<br> and to Him  you shall be gathered.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who gives life and causes death,
<br> and (in)  His (control) is the alternation of the night and the day;
<br>  do you not then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> they say the like of what the ancients said:
<br>
<a name = "verse23_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.82</b>]
<br>
<br> They say:
<br> What!
<br> When we are dead and become dust and  bones,
<br> shall we then be raised?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.83</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly we are promised this,
<br> and (so were) our  fathers aforetime;
<br> this is naught but stories of those of  old.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.84</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Whose is the earth,
<br> and whoever is therein,
<br> if you  know?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.85</b>]
<br>
<br> They will say:
<br> Allah's.
<br> Say:
<br> Will you not then mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.86</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord  of the mighty dominion?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.87</b>]
<br>
<br> They will say:
<br> (This is) Allah's.
<br> Say:
<br> Will you not then  guard (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.88</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Who is it in Whose hand is the kingdom of all  things and Who gives succor,
<br> but against Him Succor is not  given,
<br> if you do but know?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.89</b>]
<br>
<br> They will say:
<br> (This is) Allah's.
<br> Say:
<br> From whence are  you then deceived?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.90</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> We have brought to them the truth,
<br> and most surely  they are liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.91</b>]
<br>
<br> Never did Allah take to Himself a son,
<br> and never was  there with him any (other) god-- in that case would each god  have certainly taken away what he created,
<br> and some of them  would certainly have overpowered others;
<br> glory be to Allah  above what they describe!
<br>
<a name = "verse23_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.92</b>]
<br>
<br> The Knower of the unseen and the seen,
<br> so may He be  exalted above what they associate (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse23_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.93</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> if Thou shouldst make me see what they  are threatened with:
<br>
<a name = "verse23_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.94</b>]
<br>
<br> My Lord!
<br> then place me not with the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.95</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely We are well able to make you see what We  threaten them with.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.96</b>]
<br>
<br> Repel evil by what is best;
<br> We know best what they  describe.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.97</b>]
<br>
<br> And say:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> I seek refuge in Thee from the evil  suggestions of the Shaitans;
<br>
<a name = "verse23_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.98</b>]
<br>
<br> And I seek refuge in Thee!
<br> O my Lord!
<br> from their  presence.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.99</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when death overtakes one of them,
<br> he says:
<br> Send me  back,
<br> my Lord,
<br> send me back;
<br>
<a name = "verse23_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.100</b>]
<br>
<br> Haply I may do good in that which I have left.
<br> By no  means!
<br> it is a (mere) word that he speaks;
<br> and before them  is a barrier until the day they are raised.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.101</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the trumpet is blown,
<br> there shall be no ties of  relationship between them on that day,
<br> nor shall they ask of  each other.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.102</b>]
<br>
<br> Then as for him whose good deeds are preponderant,
<br>  these are the successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.103</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for him whose good deeds are light,
<br> these are  they who shall have lost their souls,
 abiding in hell<br>
<a name = "verse23_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.104</b>]
<br>
<br> The fire shall scorch their faces,
<br> and they therein  shall be in severe affliction.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.105</b>]
<br>
<br> Were not My communications recited to you?
<br> But you used  to reject them.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.106</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> O our Lord!
<br> our adversity overcame us  and we were an erring people:
<br>
<a name = "verse23_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.107</b>]
<br>
<br> O our Lord!
<br> Take us out of it;
<br> then if we return (to  evil) surely we shall be unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.108</b>]
<br>
<br> He shall say:
<br> Go away into it and speak nat to Me;
<br>
<a name = "verse23_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.109</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely there was a party of My servants who said:
<br> O OUI  .
<br> Lord!
<br> we believe,
<br> so do Thou forgive us and have mercy on  us,
<br> and Thou art the best of the Merciful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.110</b>]
<br>
<br> But you took them for a mockery until they made you  forget My remembrance and you used to laugh at them.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.111</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I have rewarded them this day because they were  patient,
<br> that they are the achievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_112"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.112</b>]
<br>
<br> He will say:
<br> How many years did you tarry in the earth?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_113"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.113</b>]
<br>
<br> They will say:
<br> We tarried a day or part of a day,
<br> but  ask those who keep account.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_114"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.114</b>]
<br>
<br> He will say:
<br> You did tarry but a little-- had you but  known (it):
<br>
<a name = "verse23_115"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.115</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> did you then think that We had created you in  vain and that you shall not be returned to Us?
<br>
<a name = "verse23_116"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.116</b>]
<br>
<br> So exalted be Allah,
<br> the True King;
<br> no god is there but  He,
<br> the Lord of the honorable dominion.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_117"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.117</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever invokes with Allah another god-- he has no  proof of this-- his reckoning is only with his Lord;
<br> surely  the unbelievers shall not be successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse23_118"></a>
<p>
[<b>23.118</b>]
<br>
<br> And say:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> forgive and have mercy,
<br> and Thou  art the best of the Merciful ones.
