<p><h3>Book 26</h3>
<br><h3>The Poets</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse26_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ta Sin Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.2</b>]
<br>
<br> These are the verses of the Book that makes (things)  clear.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Perhaps you will kill yourself with grief because they do  not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.4</b>]
<br>
<br> If We please,
<br> We should send down upon them a sign from  the heaven so that their necks should stoop to it.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And there does not come to them a new reminder from the  Beneficent God but they turn aside from it.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.6</b>]
<br>
<br> So they have indeed rejected (the truth),
<br> therefore the  news of that which they mock shall soon come to them.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not see the earth,
<br> how many of every noble kind  We have caused to grow in it?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is a sign in that,
<br> but most of them  will not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely your Lord is the Mighty,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And when your Lord called out to Musa,
<br> saying:
<br> Go to the  unjust people,
<br>    I 1.
<br> The people of Firon:
<br> Will they not guard (against  evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.12</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> surely I fear that they will reject  me;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And by breast straitens,
<br> and my tongue is not eloquent,
<br>  therefore send Thou to Haroun (to help me);
<br>
<a name = "verse26_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And they have a crime against me,
<br> therefore I fear that  they may slay me.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.15</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> By no means,
<br> so go you both with Our signs;
<br>  surely We are with you,
<br> hearing;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Then come to Firon and say:
<br> Surely we are the messengers  of the Lord of the worlds:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Then send with us the children of Israel.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.18</b>]
<br>
<br> (Firon) said:
<br> Did we not bring you up as a child among  us,
<br> and you tarried among us for (many) years of your life?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And you did (that) deed of yours which you did,
<br> and you  are one of the ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.20</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I did it then while I was of those unable to  see the right course;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.21</b>]
<br>
<br> So I fled from you when I feared you,
<br> then my Lord  granted me wisdom and made me of the apostles;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And is it a favor of which you remind me that you have  enslaved the children of Israel?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Firon said:
<br> And what is the Lord of the worlds?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.24</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what  is between them,
<br> if you would be sure.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.25</b>]
<br>
<br> (Firon) said to those around him:
<br> Do you not hear?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.26</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of old.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Said he:
<br> Most surely your Apostle who is sent to you is  mad.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.28</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> The Lord of the east and the west and what is  between them,
<br> if you understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Said he:
<br> If you will take a god besides me,
<br> I will most  certainly make you one of the imprisoned.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.30</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> What!
<br> even if I bring to you something  manifest?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Said he:
<br> Bring it then,
<br> if you are of the truthful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.32</b>]
<br>
<br> So he cast down his rod,
<br> and lo!
<br> it was an obvious  serpent,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And he drew forth his hand,
<br> and lo!
<br> it appeared white to  the onlookers.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.34</b>]
<br>
<br> (Firon) said to the chiefs around him:
<br> Most surely this  is a skillful magician,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Who desires to turn you out of your land with his magic;
<br>  what is it then that you advise?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.36</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
 Give him and his brother respite and send  heralds into the cities<br>
<a name = "verse26_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.37</b>]
<br>
<br> That they should bring to you every skillful magician.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.38</b>]
<br>
<br> So the magicians were gathered together at the appointed  time on the fixed day,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And it was said to the people:
<br> Will you gather together?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Haply we may follow the magicians,
<br> if they are the  vanquishers.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the magicians came,
<br> they said to Firon:
<br> Shall  we get a reward if we are the vanquishers?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.42</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Yes,
<br> and surely you will then be of those who  are made near.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Musa said to them:
<br> Cast what you are going to cast.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.44</b>]
<br>
<br> So they cast down their cords and their rods and said:
<br>  By Firon's power,
<br> we shall most surely be victorious.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Then Musa cast down his staff and lo!
<br> it swallowed up  the lies they told.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And the magicians were thrown down prostrate;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.47</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We believe in the Lord of the worlds:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.48</b>]
<br>
<br> The Lord of Musa and Haroun.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Said he:
<br> You believe in him before I give you  permission;
<br> most surely he is the chief of you who taught  you the magic,
<br> so you shall know:
<br> certainly I will cut off  your hands and your feet on opposite sides,
<br> and certainly I  will crucify you all.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.50</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> No harm;
<br> surely to our Lord we go back;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.51</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely we hope that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs  because we are the first of the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And We revealed to Musa,
<br> saying:
<br> Go away with My  servants travelling by night,
<br> surely you will be pursued.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.53</b>]
<br>
<br> So Firon sent heralds into the cities;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely these are a small company;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely they have enraged us;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely we are a vigilant multitude.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.57</b>]
<br>
<br> So We turned them out of gardens and springs,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And treasures and goodly dwellings,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Even so.
<br> And We gave them as a heritage to the children  of Israel.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Then they pursued them at sunrise.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.61</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the two hosts saw each other,
<br> the companions of  Musa cried out:
<br> Most surely we are being overtaken.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.62</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> By no means;
<br> surely my Lord is with me:
<br> He will  show me a way out.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We revealed to Musa:
<br> Strike the sea with your  staff.
<br> So it had cloven asunder,
<br> and each part was like a  huge mound.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.64</b>]
<br>
<br> And We brought near,
<br> there,
<br> the others.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And We saved Musa and those with him,
<br> all of them.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We drowned the others.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.67</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is a sign in this,
<br> but most of them do  not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely your Lord is the Mighty,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And recite to them the story of Ibrahim.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.70</b>]
<br>
<br> When he said to his father and his people:
<br> What do you  worship?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.71</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We worship idols,
<br> so we shall be their  votaries.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.72</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Do they hear you when you call?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.73</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they profit you or cause you harm?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.74</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Nay,
<br> we found our fathers doing so.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.75</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Have you then considered what you have been  worshipping:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.76</b>]
<br>
<br> You and your ancient sires.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.77</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they are enemies to me,
<br> but not (so) the Lord of  the worlds;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.78</b>]
<br>
<br> Who created me,
<br> then He has shown me the way:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.79</b>]
<br>
<br> And He Who gives me to eat and gives me to drink:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And when I am sick,
 then He restores me to health<br>
<a name = "verse26_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.81</b>]
<br>
<br> And He Who will cause me to die,
<br> then give me life;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And Who,
<br> I hope,
<br> will forgive me my mistakes on the day  of judgment.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.83</b>]
<br>
<br> My Lord:
<br> Grant me wisdom,
 and join me with the good<br>
<a name = "verse26_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.84</b>]
<br>
 And ordain for me a goodly mention among posterity<br>
<a name = "verse26_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.85</b>]
<br>
 And make me of the heirs of the garden of bliss<br>
<a name = "verse26_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.86</b>]
<br>
<br> And forgive my father,
<br> for surely he is of those who  have gone astray;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.87</b>]
<br>
 And disgrace me not on the day when they are raised<br>
<a name = "verse26_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.88</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which property will not avail,
 nor sons<br>
<a name = "verse26_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.89</b>]
<br>
<br> Except him who comes to Allah with a heart free (from  evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse26_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.90</b>]
<br>
<br> And the garden shall be brought near for those who guard  (against evil),
<br>
<a name = "verse26_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.91</b>]
<br>
<br> And the hell shall be made manifest to the erring ones,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.92</b>]
<br>
<br> And it shall be said to them:
<br> Where are those that you  used to worship;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.93</b>]
<br>
<br> Besides Allah?
<br> Can they help you or yet help themselves?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.94</b>]
<br>
<br> So they shall be thrown down into it,
<br> they and the  erring ones,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.95</b>]
<br>
<br> And the hosts of the Shaitan,
<br> all.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.96</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say while they contend therein:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.97</b>]
<br>
<br> By Allah!
<br> we were certainly in manifest error,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.98</b>]
<br>
<br> When we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.99</b>]
<br>
<br> And none but the guilty led us astray;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.100</b>]
<br>
<br> So we have no intercessors,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.101</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor a true friend;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.102</b>]
<br>
<br> But if we could but once return,
<br> we would be of the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.103</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is a sign in this,
<br> but most of them  do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.104</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely your Lord is the Mighty,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.105</b>]
<br>
<br> The people of Nuh rejected the apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.106</b>]
<br>
<br> When their brother Nuh said to them:
<br> Will you not guard  (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.107</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.108</b>]
<br>
 Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and  obey me<br>
<a name = "verse26_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.109</b>]
<br>
<br> And I do not ask you any reward for it;
<br> my reward is  only with the Lord of the worlds:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.110</b>]
<br>
<br> So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.111</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Shall we believe in you while the meanest  follow you?
<br>    112 He said:
<br> And what knowledge have I of what they do?
<br>    113 Their account is only with my Lord,
 if you could  perceive<br>
<a name = "verse26_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.114</b>]
<br>
<br> And I am not going to drive away the believers;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_112"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.115</b>]
<br>
<br> I am naught but a plain warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_113"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.116</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> If you desist not,
<br> O Nuh,
<br> you shall most  certainly be of those stoned to death.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_114"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.117</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> Surely my people give me the lie!
<br>
<a name = "verse26_115"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.118</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore judge Thou between me and them with a (just)  judgment,
<br> and deliver me and those who are with me of the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_116"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.119</b>]
<br>
<br> So We delivered him and those with him in the laden  ark.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_117"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.120</b>]
<br>
 Then We drowned the rest afterwards<br>
<a name = "verse26_118"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.121</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is a sign in this,
<br> but most of them  do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_119"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.122</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely your Lord is the Mighty,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_120"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.123</b>]
<br>
<br> Ad gave the lie to the apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_121"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.124</b>]
<br>
<br> When their brother Hud said to them:
<br> Will you not guard  (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_122"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.125</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_123"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.126</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and  obey me:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_124"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.127</b>]
<br>
<br> And I do not ask you any reward for it;
 surely my  reward 15 only with the Lord of the worlds<br>
<a name = "verse26_125"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.128</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you build on every height a monument?
<br> Vain is it  that you do:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_126"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.129</b>]
<br>
 And you make strong fortresses that perhaps you may<br>
<a name = "verse26_127"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.130</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you lay hands (on men) you lay hands (like)  tyrants;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_128"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.131</b>]
<br>
 So guard against (the punishment of) Allah and obey me<br>
<a name = "verse26_129"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.132</b>]
<br>
<br> And be careful of (your duty to) Him Who has given you  abundance of what you know.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_130"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.133</b>]
<br>
 He has given you abundance of cattle and children<br>
<a name = "verse26_131"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.134</b>]
<br>
<br> And gardens and fountains;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_132"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.135</b>]
<br>
 Surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous  day<br>
<a name = "verse26_133"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.136</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
 It is the same to us whether you admonish or  are not one of the admonishers<br>
<a name = "verse26_134"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.137</b>]
<br>
<br> This is naught but a custom of the ancients;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_135"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.138</b>]
<br>
<br> And we are not going to be punished.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_136"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.139</b>]
<br>
<br> So they gave him the lie,
<br> then We destroyed them.
<br> Most  surely there is a sign in this,
<br> but most of them do not  believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_137"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.140</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely your Lord is the Mighty,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_138"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.141</b>]
<br>
 Samood gave the lie to the apostles<br>
<a name = "verse26_139"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.142</b>]
<br>
<br> When their brother Salih said to them:
<br> Will you not  guard (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_140"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.143</b>]
<br>
 Surely I am a faithful apostle to you<br>
<a name = "verse26_141"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.144</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and  obey me:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_142"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.145</b>]
<br>
<br> And I do not ask you any reward for it;
<br> my reward is  only with the Lord of the worlds:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_143"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.146</b>]
<br>
<br> Will you be left secure in what is here;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_144"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.147</b>]
<br>
<br> In gardens and fountains,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_145"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.148</b>]
<br>
<br> And cornfields and palm-trees having fine spadices?
<br>    149 And you hew houses out of the mountains exultingly;
<br>    15O Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and  obey me;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_146"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.151</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not obey the bidding of the extravagant,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_147"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.152</b>]
<br>
<br> Who make mischief in the land and do not act aright.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_148"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.153</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> You are only of the deluded ones;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_149"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.154</b>]
<br>
<br> You are naught but a mortal like ourselves;
<br> so bring a  sign if you are one of the truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_150"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.155</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> This is a she-camel;
<br> she shall have her  portion of water,
<br> and you have your portion of water on an  appointed time;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_151"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.156</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not touch her with evil,

<br>
<a name = "verse26_152"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.157</b>]
<br>
<br> But they hamstrung her,
<br> then regretted;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_153"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.158</b>]
<br>
<br> So the punishment overtook them.
<br> Most surely there is a  sign in this,
<br> but most of them do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_154"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.159</b>]
<br>

[<b>26.160</b>]
<br>
<br> The people of Lut gave the lie to the apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_156"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.161</b>]
<br>
<br> When their brother Lut said to them:
<br> Will you not guard  (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_157"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.162</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_158"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.163</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and  obey me:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_159"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.164</b>]
<br>
<br> And I do not ask you any reward for it;
<br> my reward is  only with the Lord of the worlds;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_160"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.165</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
 do you come to the males from among the creatures<br>
<a name = "verse26_161"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.166</b>]
<br>
<br> And leave what your Lord has created for you of your  wives?
<br> Nay,
<br> you are a people exceeding limits.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_162"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.167</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> If you desist not,
<br> O Lut!
<br> you shall surely  be of those who are expelled.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_163"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.168</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely I am of those who utterly abhor your    169 My Lord !
<br> deliver me and my followers from what they do.
<br>    17O So We delivered him and his followers all,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_164"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.171</b>]
<br>
<br> Except an old woman,
<br> among those who remained behind.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_165"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.172</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We utterly destroyed the others.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_166"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.173</b>]
<br>
<br> And We rained down upon them a rain,
<br> and evil was the  rain on those warned.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_167"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.174</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is a sign in this,
<br> but most of them  do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_168"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.175</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely your Lord is the Mighty,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_169"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.176</b>]
<br>
<br> The dwellers of the thicket gave the lie to the  apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_170"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.177</b>]
<br>
<br> When Shu'aib said to them:
<br> Will you not guard (against  evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_171"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.178</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely I am a faithful apostle to you;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_172"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.179</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore guard against (the punishment of) Allah and  obey me:
<br>
<a name = "verse26_173"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.180</b>]
<br>
<br> And I do not ask you any reward for it,
<br> my reward is  only with the Lord of the worlds;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_174"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.181</b>]
<br>
<br> Give a full measure and be not of those who diminish;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_175"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.182</b>]
<br>
<br> And weigh (things) with a right balance,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_176"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.183</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not wrong men of their things,
<br> and do not act  corruptly in the earth,
<br> making mischief.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_177"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.184</b>]
<br>
<br> And guard against (the punishment of) Him who created  you and the former nations.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_178"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.185</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> You are only of those deluded;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_179"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.186</b>]
<br>
<br> And you are naught but a mortal like ourselves,
<br> and we  know you to be certainly of the liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_180"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.187</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore cause a portion of the heaven to come down  upon us,
<br> if you are one of the truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_181"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.188</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord knows best what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_182"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.189</b>]
<br>
<br> But they called him a liar,
<br> so the punishment of the  day of covering overtook them;
<br> surely it was the punishment  of a grievous day.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_183"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.190</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is a sign in this,
<br> but most of them  do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_184"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.191</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely your Lord is Mighty,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_185"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.192</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely this is a revelation from the Lord of  the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_186"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.193</b>]
<br>
<br> The Faithful Spirit has descended with it,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_187"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.194</b>]
<br>
 Upon your heart that you may be of the warners<br>
<a name = "verse26_188"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.195</b>]
<br>
<br> In plain Arabic language.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_189"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.196</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely the same is in the scriptures of the  ancients.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_190"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.197</b>]
<br>
<br> Is it not a sign to them that the learned men of the  Israelites know it?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_191"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.198</b>]
<br>
 And if we had revealed it to any of the foreigners<br>
<a name = "verse26_192"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.199</b>]
<br>
<br> So that he should have recited it to them,
<br> they would  not have believed therein.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_193"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.200</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus have We caused it to enter into the hearts of the  guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_194"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.201</b>]
<br>
<br> They will not believe in it until they see the painful  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_195"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.202</b>]
<br>
<br> And it shall come to them all of a sudden,
<br> while they  shall not perceive;
<br>
<a name = "verse26_196"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.203</b>]
<br>
<br> Then they will say:
<br> Shall we be respited?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_197"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.204</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do they still seek to hasten on Our punishment?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_198"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.205</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you then considered if We let them enjoy  themselves for years,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_199"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.206</b>]
<br>
<br> Then there comes to them that with which they are  threatened,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_200"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.207</b>]
<br>
<br> That which they were made to enjoy shall not avail  them?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_201"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.208</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not destroy any town but it had (its)  warners,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_202"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.209</b>]
<br>
<br> To remind,
<br> and We are never unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_203"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.210</b>]
<br>
<br> And the Shaitans have not come down with it.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_204"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.211</b>]
<br>
<br> And it behoves them not,
<br> and they have not the power to  do (it).
<br>    212 Most surely they are far removed from the hearing of it.
<br>    213 So call not upon another god with Allah,
<br> lest you be of  those who are punished.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_205"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.214</b>]
<br>
<br> And warn your nearest relations,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_206"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.215</b>]
<br>
<br> And be kind to him who follows you of the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_207"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.216</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they disobey you,
<br> then say:
<br> Surely I am clear of  what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_208"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.217</b>]
<br>
<br> And rely on the Mighty,
<br> the Merciful,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_209"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.218</b>]
<br>
<br> Who sees you when you stand up.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_210"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.219</b>]
<br>
<br> And your turning over and over among those who  prostrate themselves before Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_211"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.220</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely He is the Hearing,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_212"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.221</b>]
<br>
<br> Shall I inform you (of him) upon whom the Shaitans  descend?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_213"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.222</b>]
<br>
<br> They descend upon every lying,
<br> sinful one,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_214"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.223</b>]
<br>
<br> They incline their ears,
<br> and most of them are liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_215"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.224</b>]
<br>
<br> And as to the poets,
<br> those who go astray follow them.
<br>
<a name = "verse26_216"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.225</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that they wander about bewildered in  every valley?
<br>
<a name = "verse26_217"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.226</b>]
<br>
<br> And that they say that which they do not do,
<br>
<a name = "verse26_218"></a>
<p>
[<b>26.227</b>]
<br>
<br> Except those who believe and do good and remember Allah  much,
<br> and defend themselves after they are oppressed;
<br> and  they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of  turning they shall turn back.
