<p><h3>Book 38</h3>
<br><h3>Suad</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse38_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Suad,
<br> I swear by the Quran,
<br> full of admonition.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> those who disbelieve are in self-exaltation and  opposition.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.3</b>]
<br>
<br> How many did We destroy before them of the generations,
<br>    then they cried while the time of escaping had passed away.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from  among themselves,
<br> and the disbelievers say:
<br> This IS an  enchanter,
<br> a liar.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.5</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> makes he the gods a single God?
<br> A strange thing is  this,
<br> to be sure!
<br>
<a name = "verse38_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And the chief persons of them break forth,
<br> saying:
<br> Go and  steadily adhere to your gods;
<br> this is most surely a thing  sought after.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.7</b>]
<br>
<br> We never heard of this in the former faith;
<br> this is  nothing but a forgery:
<br>
<a name = "verse38_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Has the reminder been revealed to him from among us?
<br> Nay!
<br>  they are in doubt as to My reminder.
<br> Nay!
<br> they have not yet  tasted My chastisement!
<br>
<a name = "verse38_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Or is it that they have the treasures of the mercy of  your Lord,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the great Giver?
<br>
<a name = "verse38_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Or is it that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and  the earth and what is between them?
 Then let them ascend by  any<br>
<a name = "verse38_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.11</b>]
<br>
<br> A host of deserters of the allies shall be here put to  flight.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.12</b>]
<br>
<br> The people of Nuh and Ad,
<br> and Firon,
<br> the lord of spikes,
<br>  rejected (apostles) before them.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And Samood and the people of Lut and the dwellers of the  thicket;
<br> these were the parties.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.14</b>]
<br>
<br> There was none of them but called the apostles liars,
<br> so  just was My retribution.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor do these await aught but a single cry,
<br> there being  no delay in it.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> O our Lord!
<br> hasten on to us our portion  before the day of reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Bear patiently what they say,
<br> and remember Our servant  Dawood,
<br> the possessor of power;
<br> surely he was frequent m  returning (to Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse38_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We made the mountains to sing the glory (of  Allah) in unison with him at the evening and the sunrise,
<br>
<a name = "verse38_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And the birds gathered together;
<br> all joined in singing  with him.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom  and a clear judgment.
<br>    21 .
<br> And has there come to you the story of the litigants,
<br>  when they made an entry into the private chamber by  ascending over the walls?
<br>
<a name = "verse38_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.22</b>]
<br>
<br> When they entered in upon Dawood and he was frightened  at them,
<br> they said:
<br> Fear not;
<br> two litigants,
<br> of whom one has  acted wrongfully towards the other,
<br> therefore decide between  us with justice,
<br> and do not act unjustly,
<br> and guide us to  the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely this is my brother;
<br> he has ninety-nine ewes and I  have a single ewe;
<br> but he said:
<br> Make it over to me,
<br> and he  has prevailed against me in discourse.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.24</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding  your ewe (to add) to his own ewes;
<br> and most surely most of  the partners act wrongfully towards one another,
<br> save those  who believe and do good,
<br> and very few are they;
<br> and Dawood  was sure that We had tried him,
<br> so he sought the protection  of his Lord and he fell down bowing and turned time after  time (to Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse38_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore We rectified for him this,
<br> and most surely he  had a nearness to Us and an excellent resort.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.26</b>]
<br>
<br> o Dawood !
<br> surely We have made you a ruler in the land;
<br>  so judge between men with justice and do not follow desire,
<br>  lest it should lead you astray from the path of Allah;
<br> (as  for) those who go astray from the path of Allah,
<br> they shall  surely have a severe punishment because they forgot the day  of reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what  is between them in vain;
<br> that is the opinion of those who  disbelieve then woe to those who disbelieve on account of  the fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Shall We treat those who believe and do good like the  mischief-makers in the earth?
<br> Or shall We make those who  guard (against evil) like the wicked?
<br>
<a name = "verse38_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.29</b>]
<br>
<br> (It is) a Book We have revealed to you abounding in good  that they may ponder over its verses,
<br> and that those endowed  with understanding may be mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave to Dawood Sulaiman,
<br> most excellent the  servant!
<br> Surely he was frequent in returning (to Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse38_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.31</b>]
<br>
<br> When there were brought to him in the evening (horses)  still when standing,
 swift when running--<br>
<a name = "verse38_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he said:
<br> Surely I preferred the good things to the  remembrance of my Lord-- until the sun set and time for Asr  prayer was over,
<br> (he said):
<br>
<a name = "verse38_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Bring them back to me;
<br> so he began to slash (their) legs  and necks.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We tried Sulaiman,
<br> and We put on his  throne a (mere) body,
<br> so he turned (to Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse38_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.35</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> do Thou forgive me and grant me a  kingdom which is not fit for (being inherited by) anyone  after me;
<br>
<a name = "verse38_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We made the wind subservient to him;
<br> it made his  command to run gently wherever he desired,
<br>
<a name = "verse38_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And the shaitans,
<br> every builder and diver,
<br>
<a name = "verse38_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And others fettered in chains.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.39</b>]
<br>
<br> This is Our free gift,
<br> therefore give freely or  withhold,
<br> without reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent  resort.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And remember Our servant Ayyub,
<br> when he called upon his  Lord:
<br> The Shaitan has afflicted me with toil and torment.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Urge with your foot;
<br> here is a cool washing-place and a  drink.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave him his family and the like of them with  them,
<br> as a mercy from Us,
<br> and as a reminder to those  possessed of understanding.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with  It and do not break your oath;
<br> surely We found him patient;
<br>  most excellent the servant!
<br> Surely he was frequent m  returning (to Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse38_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And remember Our servants Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqoub,
<br>  men of power and insight.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We purified them by a pure quality,
<br> the keeping m  mind of the (final) abode.
<br>    47 And most surely they were with Us,
<br> of the elect,
<br> the  best.
<br>    48 And remember Ismail and Al-Yasha and Zulkifl;
<br> and they  were all of the best.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.49</b>]
<br>
<br> This is a reminder;
<br> and most surely there is an  excellent resort for those who guard (against evil),
<br>
<a name = "verse38_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.50</b>]
<br>
<br> The gardens of perpetuity,
<br> the doors are opened for  them.
<br>    51 .
<br> Reclining therein,
<br> calling therein for many fruits and  drink.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And with them shall be those restraining their eyes,
<br>  equals in age.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.53</b>]
<br>
<br> This is what you are promised for the day of reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely this is Our sustenance;
<br> it shall never come  to an end;
<br>
<a name = "verse38_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.55</b>]
<br>
<br> This (shall be so);
<br> and most surely there is an evil  resort for the inordinate ones;
<br>
<a name = "verse38_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Hell;
<br> they shall enter it,
<br> so evil is the resting-place.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.57</b>]
<br>
<br> This (shall be so);
<br> so let them taste it,
<br> boiling and  intensely cold (drink).
<br>
<a name = "verse38_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And other (punishment) of the same kind-- of various  sorts.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.59</b>]
<br>
<br> This is an army plunging in without consideration along  with you;
<br> no welcome for them,
<br> surely they shall enter fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.60</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> Nay!
<br> you-- no welcome to you:
<br> you did  proffer it to us,
<br> so evil is the resting-place.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.61</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> whoever prepared it first for  us,
<br> add Thou to him a double chastisement in the fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.62</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall say:
<br> What is the matter with us that we  do not see men whom we used to count among the vicious?
<br>
<a name = "verse38_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Was it that we (only) took them in scorn,
<br> or have our  eyes (now) turned aside from them?
<br>
<a name = "verse38_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.64</b>]
<br>
<br> That most surely is the truth:
<br> the contending one with  another of the inmates of the fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I am only a warner,
<br> and there is no god but Allah,
<br>  the One,
<br> the Subduer (of all):
<br>
<a name = "verse38_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.66</b>]
<br>
<br> The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is  between them,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the most Forgiving.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.67</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> It is a message of importance,
<br>
<a name = "verse38_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.68</b>]
<br>
<br> (And) you are turning aside from it:
<br>
<a name = "verse38_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.69</b>]
<br>
<br> 1 had no knowledge of the exalted chiefs when they  contended:
<br>
<a name = "verse38_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.70</b>]
<br>
<br> Naught is revealed to me save that I am a plain warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.71</b>]
<br>
<br> When your Lord said to the angels;
<br> Surely I am going to  create a mortal from dust:
<br>
<a name = "verse38_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.72</b>]
<br>
<br> So when I have made him complete and breathed into him  of My spirit,
<br> then fall down making obeisance to him.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And the angels did obeisance,
<br> all of them,
<br>
<a name = "verse38_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.74</b>]
<br>
<br> But not Iblis:
<br> he was proud and he was one of the  unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.75</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O Iblis!
<br> what prevented you that you should do  obeisance to him whom I created with My two hands?
<br> Are you  proud or are you of the exalted ones?
<br>
<a name = "verse38_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.76</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I am better than he;
<br> Thou hast created me of  fire,
<br> and him Thou didst create of dust.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.77</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Then get out of it,
<br> for surely you are driven  away:
<br>
<a name = "verse38_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely My curse is on you to the day of judgment.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.79</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> then respite me to the day that they  are raised.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.80</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely you are of the respited ones,
<br>
<a name = "verse38_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Till the period of the time made known.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.82</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Then by Thy Might I will surely make them live  an evil life,
<br> all,
<br>
<a name = "verse38_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.83</b>]
<br>
<br> Except Thy servants from among them,
<br> the purified ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.84</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> The truth then is and the truth do I speak:
<br>
<a name = "verse38_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.85</b>]
<br>
<br> That I will most certainly fill hell with you and with  those among them who follow you,
<br> all.
<br>
<a name = "verse38_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.86</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I do not ask you for any reward for it;
<br> nor am I of  those who affect:
<br>
<a name = "verse38_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.87</b>]
<br>
<br> It is nothing but a reminder to the nations;
<br>
<a name = "verse38_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>38.88</b>]
<br>
<br> And most certainly you will come to know about it after  a time.
