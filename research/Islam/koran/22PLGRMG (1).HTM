<p><h3>Book 22</h3>
<br><h3>The Pilgrimage</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse22_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O people!
<br> guard against (the punishment from) your Lord;
<br>  surely the violence of the hour is a grievous thing.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.2</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when you shall see it,
<br> every woman giving suck  shall quit in confusion what she suckled,
<br> and every pregnant  woman shall lay down her burden,
<br> and you shall see men  intoxicated,
<br> and they shall not be intoxicated but the  chastisement of Allah will be severe.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And among men there is he who disputes about Allah  without knowledge and follows every rebellious Shaitan;
<br>
<a name = "verse22_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Against him it is written down that whoever takes him for  a friend,
<br> he shall lead him astray and conduct him to the  chastisement of the burning fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.5</b>]
<br>
<br> O people!
<br> if you are in doubt about the raising,
<br> then  surely We created you from dust,
<br> then from a small seed,
<br>  then from a clot,
<br> then from a lump of flesh,
<br> complete in  make and incomplete,
<br> that We may make clear to you;
<br> and We  cause what We please to stay in the wombs till an appointed  time,
<br> then We bring you forth as babies,
<br> then that you may  attain your maturity;
<br> and of you is he who is caused to die,
<br>  and of you is he who is brought back to the worst part of  life,
<br> so that after having knowledge he does not know  anything;
<br> and you see the earth sterile land,
<br> but when We  send down on it the water,
<br> it stirs and swells and brings  forth of every kind a beautiful herbage.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.6</b>]
<br>
 This is because Allah is the Truth and because He gives  life to the dead and because He has power over all things<br>
<a name = "verse22_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And because the hour is coming,
<br> there is no doubt about  it;
<br> and because Allah shall raise up those who are in the  graves.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And among men there is he who disputes about Allah  without knowledge and without guidance and without an  illuminating book,
<br>
<a name = "verse22_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Turning away haughtily that he may lead (others) astray  from the way of Allah;
<br> for him is disgrace in this world,
<br>  and on the day of resurrection We will make him taste the  punishment of burning:
<br>
<a name = "verse22_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.10</b>]
<br>
<br> This is due to what your two hands have sent before,
<br> and  because Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And among men is he who serves Allah (standing) on the  verge,
<br> so that if good befalls him he is satisfied  therewith,
<br> but if a trial afflict him he turns back  headlong;
<br> he loses this world as well as the hereafter;
<br> that  is a manifest loss.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.12</b>]
<br>
<br> He calls besides Allah upon that which does not harm him  and that which does not profit him,
<br> that is the great  straying.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.13</b>]
<br>
<br> He calls upon him whose harm is nearer than his profit;
<br>  evil certainly is the guardian and evil certainly is the  associate.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah will cause those who believe and do good  deeds to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow,
<br> surely  Allah does what He pleases.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever thinks that Allah will not assist him in this  life and the hereafter,
<br> let him stretch a rope to the  ceiling,
<br> then let him cut (it) off,
<br> then let him see if his  struggle will take away that at which he is enraged.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus have We revealed it,
<br> being clear arguments,
<br> and  because Allah guides whom He intends.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who believe and those who are Jews and the  Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who  associate (others with Allah)-- surely Allah will decide  between them on the day of resurrection;
<br> surely Allah is a  witness over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah is He,
<br> Whom obeys whoever is  in the heavens and whoever is in the earth,
<br> and the sun and  the moon and the stars,
<br> and the mountains and the trees,
<br> and  the animals and many of the people;
<br> and many there are  against whom chastisement has become necessary;
<br> and  whomsoever Allah abases,
<br> there is none who can make him  honorable;
<br> surely Allah does what He pleases.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.19</b>]
<br>
<br> These are two adversaries who dispute about their Lord;
<br>  then (as to) those who disbelieve,
<br> for them are cut out  garments of fire,
<br> boiling water shall be poured over their  heads.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.20</b>]
<br>
<br> With it shall be melted what is in their bellies and  (their) skins as well.
<br>    21 And for them are whips of iron.
<br>    22 Whenever they will desire to go forth from it,
<br> from  grief,
<br> they shall be turned back into it,
<br> and taste the  chastisement of burning.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good  deeds enter gardens beneath which rivers flow;
<br> they shall be  adorned therein with bracelets of gold and (with) pearls,
<br>  and their garments therein shall be of silk.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And they are guided to goodly words and they are guided  into the path of the Praised One.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who disbelieve,
<br> and hinder (men)  from Allah's way and from the Sacred Mosque which We have  made equally for all men,
<br> (for) the dweller therein and  (for) the visitor,
<br> and whoever shall incline therein to  wrong unjustly,
<br> We will make him taste of a painful  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We assigned to Ibrahim the place of the House,
<br>  saying:
<br> Do not associate with Me aught,
<br> and purify My House  for those who make the circuit and stand to pray and bow and  prostrate themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And proclaim among men the Pilgrimage:
<br> they will come to  you on foot and on every lean camel,
<br> coming from every  remote path,
<br>
<a name = "verse22_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.28</b>]
<br>
<br> That they may witness advantages for them and mention  the name of Allah during stated days over what He has given  them of the cattle quadrupeds,
<br> then eat of them and feed the  distressed one,
<br> the needy.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Then let them accomplish their needful acts of shaving  and cleansing,
<br> and let them fulfil their vows and let them  go round the Ancient House.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.30</b>]
<br>
<br> That (shall be so);
<br> and whoever respects the sacred  ordinances of Allah,
<br> it is better for him with his Lord;
<br> and  the cattle are made lawful for you,
<br> except that which is  recited to you,
<br> therefore avoid the uncleanness of the idols  and avoid false words,
<br>
<a name = "verse22_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Being upright for Allah,
<br> not associating aught with Him  and whoever associates (others) with Allah,
<br> it is as though  he had fallen from on high,
<br> then the birds snatch him away  or the wind carries him off to a far-distant place.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.32</b>]
<br>
<br> That (shall be so);
<br> and whoever respects the signs of  Allah,
<br> this surely is (the outcome) of the piety of hearts.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.33</b>]
<br>
<br> You have advantages in them till a fixed time,
<br> then  their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And to every nation We appointed acts of devotion that  they may mention the name of Allah on what He has given them  of the cattle quadrupeds;
<br> so your God is One God,
<br> therefore  to Him should you submit,
<br> and give good news to the humble,
<br>
<a name = "verse22_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.35</b>]
<br>
<br> (To) those whose hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned,
<br>  and those who are patient under that which afflicts them,
<br>  and those who keep up prayer,
<br> and spend (benevolently) out  of what We have given them.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) the camels,
<br> We have made them of the signs  of the religion of Allah for you;
<br> for you therein is much  good;
<br> therefore mention the name of Allah on them as they  stand in a row,
<br> then when they fall down eat of them and  feed the poor man who is contented and the beggar;
<br> thus have  We made them subservient to you,
<br> that you may be grateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.37</b>]
<br>
<br> There does not reach Allah their flesh nor their blood,
<br>  but to Him is acceptable the guarding (against evil) on your  part;
<br> thus has He made them subservient to you,
<br> that you may  magnify Allah because He has guided you aright;
<br> and give  good news to those who do good (to others).
<br>
<a name = "verse22_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah will defend those who believe;
<br> surely Allah  does not love any one who is unfaithful,
<br> ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Permission (to fight) is given to those upon whom war is  made because they are oppressed,
<br> and most surely Allah is  well able to assist them;
<br>
<a name = "verse22_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who have been expelled from their homes without a  just cause except that they say:
<br> Our Lord is Allah.
<br> And had  there not been Allah's repelling some people by others,
<br>  certainly there would have been pulled down cloisters and  churches and synagogues and mosques in which Allah's name is  much remembered;
<br> and surely Allah will help him who helps  His cause;
<br> most surely Allah is Strong,
<br> Mighty.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who,
<br> should We establish them in the land,
<br> will  keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and enjoin good and  forbid evil;
<br> and Allah's is the end of affairs.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they reject you,
<br> then already before you did the  people of Nuh and Ad and Samood reject (prophets).
<br>
<a name = "verse22_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And the people of Ibrahim and the people of Lut,
<br>
<a name = "verse22_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.44</b>]
<br>
<br> As well as those of Madyan and Musa (too) was rejected,
<br>  but I gave respite to the unbelievers,
<br> then did I overtake  them,
<br> so how (severe) was My disapproval.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.45</b>]
<br>
<br> So how many a town did We destroy while it was unjust,
<br>  so it was fallen down upon its roofs,
<br> and (how many a)  deserted well and palace raised high.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Have they not travelled in the land so that they should  have hearts with which to understand,
<br> or ears with which to  hear?
<br> For surely it is not the eyes that are blind,
<br> but  blind are the hearts which are in the breasts.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And they ask you to hasten on the punishment,
<br> and Allah  will by no means fail in His promise,
<br> and surely a day with  your Lord is as a thousand years of what you number.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many a town to which I gave respite while it was  unjust,
<br> then I overtook it,
<br> and to Me is the return.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O people!
<br> I am only a plain warner to you.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Then (as for) those who believe and do good,
<br> they shall  have forgiveness and an honorable sustenance.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who strive to oppose Our  communications,
<br> they shall be the inmates of the flaming  fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not send before you any apostle or prophet,
<br>  but when he desired,
<br> the Shaitan made a suggestion  respecting his desire;
<br> but Allah annuls that which the  Shaitan casts,
<br> then does Allah establish His communications,
<br>  and Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise,
<br>
<a name = "verse22_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.53</b>]
<br>
<br> So that He may make what the Shaitan casts a trial for  those in whose hearts is disease and those whose hearts are  hard;
<br> and most surely the unjust are in a great opposition,
<br>
<a name = "verse22_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And that those who have been given the knowledge may  know that it is the truth from your Lord,
<br> so they may  believe in it and their hearts may be lowly before it;
<br> and  most surely Allah is the Guide of those who believe into a  right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve shall not cease to be in doubt  concerning it until the hour overtakes them suddenly,
<br> or  there comes on them the chastisement of a destructive day.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.56</b>]
<br>
<br> The kingdom on that day shall be Allah's;
<br> He will judge  between them;
<br> so those who believe and do good will be in  gardens of bliss.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who disbelieve in and reject Our  communications,
<br> these it is who shall have a disgraceful  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who fly in Allah's way and are then  slain or die,
<br> Allah will most certainly grant them a goodly  sustenance,
<br> and most surely Allah is the best Giver of  sustenance.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.59</b>]
<br>
<br> He will certainly cause them to enter a place of  entrance which they shall be well pleased with,
<br> and most  surely Allah is Knowing,
<br> Forbearing.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.60</b>]
<br>
<br> That (shall be so);
<br> and he who retaliates with the like  of that with which he has been afflicted and he has been  oppressed,
<br> Allah will most certainly aid him;
<br> most  surely.
<br>Allah is Pardoning,
<br> Forgiving.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.61</b>]
<br>
<br> That is because Allah causes the night to enter into the  day and causes the day to enter into the night,
<br> and because  Allah is Hearing,
<br> Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.62</b>]
<br>
<br> That is because Allah is the Truth,
<br> and that what they  call upon besides Him-- that is the falsehood,
<br> and because  Allah is the High,
<br> the Great.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the  cloud so the earth becomes green?
<br> Surely Allah is Benignant,
<br>  Aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.64</b>]
<br>
<br> His is whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in  the earth;
<br> and most surely Allah is the Self-sufficient,
<br> the  Praised.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah has made subservient to you  whatsoever is in the earth and the ships running in the sea  by His command?
<br> And He withholds the heaven from falling on  the earth except with His permission;
<br> most surely Allah is  Compassionate,
<br> Merciful to men.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.66</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who has brought you to life,
<br> then He will  cause you to die,
<br> then bring you to life (again);
<br> most  surely man is ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.67</b>]
<br>
<br> To every nation We appointed acts of devotion which they  observe,
<br> therefore they should not dispute with you about  the matter and call to your Lord;
<br> most surely you are on a  right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they contend with you,
<br> say:
<br> Allah best knows what  you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection  respecting that in which you differ.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.70</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not know that Allah knows what is in the heaven  and the earth?
<br> Surely this is in a book;
<br> surely this is easy  to Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And they serve besides Allah that for which He has not  sent any authority,
<br> and that of which they have no  knowledge;
<br> and for the unjust there shall be no helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our clear communications are recited to them  you will find denial on the faces of those who disbelieve;
<br>  they almost spring upon those who recite to them Our  communications.
<br> Say:
<br> Shall I inform you of what is worse  than this?
<br> The fire;
<br> Allah has promised it to those who  disbelieve;
<br> and how evil the resort!
<br>
<a name = "verse22_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.73</b>]
<br>
<br> O people!
<br> a parable is set forth,
<br> therefore listen to  it:
<br> surely those whom you call upon besides Allah cannot  create fly,
<br> though they should all gather for it,
<br> and should  the fly snatch away anything from them,
<br> they could not take  it back from i weak are the invoker and the invoked.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.74</b>]
<br>
<br> They have not estimated Allah with the estimation that i  due to Him;
<br> most surely Allah is Strong,
<br> Mighty.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.75</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah chooses messengers from among the angels and from  among the men;
<br> surely Allah is Hearing,
<br> Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.76</b>]
<br>
<br> He knows what is before them and what is behind them and  to Allah are all affairs turned back.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.77</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> bow down and prostrate yourselves and  serve your Lord,
<br> and do.
<br>good that you may succeed.
<br>
<a name = "verse22_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>22.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And strive hard in (the way of) Allah,
<br> (such) a striving  a is due to Him;
<br> He has chosen you and has not laid upon you  an hardship in religion;
<br> the faith of your father Ibrahim;
<br>  He named you Muslims before and in this,
<br> that the Apostle  may be a bearer of witness to you,
<br> and you may be bearers of  witness to the people;
<br> therefore keep up prayer and pay the  poor-rate and hold fast by Allah;
<br> He is your Guardian;
<br> how  excellent the Guardian and how excellent the Helper!
