<p><h3>Book 60</h3>
<br><h3>The Examined One</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse60_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not take My enemy and your enemy  for friends:
<br> would you offer them love while they deny what  has come to you of the truth,
<br> driving out the Apostle and  yourselves because you believe in Allah,
<br> your Lord?
<br> If you  go forth struggling hard in My path and seeking My pleasure,
<br>  would you manifest love to them?
<br> And I know what you conceal  and what you manifest;
<br> and whoever of you does this,
<br> he  indeed has gone astray from the straight path.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.2</b>]
<br>
<br> If they find you,
<br> they will be your enemies,
<br> and will  stretch forth towards you their hands and their tongues with  evil,
<br> and they ardently desire that you may disbelieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Your relationship would not profit you,
<br> nor your children  on the day of resurrection;
<br> He will decide between you;
<br> and  Allah sees what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Indeed,
<br> there is for you a good example in Ibrahim and  those with him when they said to their people:
<br> Surely we are  clear of you and of what you serve besides Allah;
<br> we declare  ourselves to be clear of you,
<br> and enmity and hatred have  appeared between us and you forever until you believe in  Allah alone-- but not in what Ibrahim said to his father:
<br> I  would certainly ask forgiveness for you,
<br> and I do not  control for you aught from Allah-- Our Lord!
<br> on Thee do we  rely,
<br> and to Thee do we turn,
<br> and to Thee is the eventual  coming:
<br>
<a name = "verse60_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Our Lord!
<br> do not make us a trial for those who  disbelieve,
<br> and forgive us,
<br> our Lord!
<br> surely Thou art the  Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly there is for you in them a good example,
<br> for  him who fears Allah and the last day;
<br> and whoever turns  back,
<br> then surely Allah is the Self-sufficient,
<br> the Praised.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.7</b>]
<br>
<br> It may be that Allah will bring about friendship between  you and those whom you hold to be your enemies among them;
<br>  and Allah is Powerful;
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah does not forbid you respecting those who have not  made war against you on account of (your) religion,
<br> and have  not driven you forth from your homes,
<br> that you show them  kindness and deal with them justly;
<br> surely Allah loves the  doers of justice.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah only forbids you respecting those who made war upon  you on account of (your) religion,
<br> and drove you forth from  your homes and backed up (others) in your expulsion,
<br> that  you make friends with them,
<br> and whoever makes friends with  them,
<br> these are the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.10</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> when believing women come to you  flying,
<br> then examine them;
<br> Allah knows best their faith;
<br>  then if you find them to be believing women,
<br> do not send  them back to the unbelievers,
<br> neither are these (women)  lawful for them,
<br> nor are those (men) lawful for them,
<br> and  give them what they have spent;
<br> and no blame attaches to you  in marrying them when you give them their dowries;
<br> and hold  not to the ties of marriage of unbelieving women,
<br> and ask  for what you have spent,
<br> and kt them ask for what they have  spent.
<br> That is Allah's judgment;
<br> He judges between you,
<br> and  Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And if anything (out of the dowries) of your wives has  passed away from you to the unbelievers,
<br> then your turn  comes,
<br> give to those whose wives have gone away the like of  what they have spent,
<br> and be careful of (your duty to) Allah  in Whom you believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.12</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> when believing women come to you giving you a  pledge that they will not associate aught with Allah,
<br> and  will not steal,
<br> and will not commit fornication,
<br> and will  not kill their children,
<br> and will not bring a calumny which  they have forged of themselves,
<br> and will not disobey you in  what is good,
<br> accept their pledge,
<br> and ask forgiveness for  them from Allah;
<br> surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse60_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>60.13</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not make friends with a people  with whom Allah is wroth;
<br> indeed they despair of the  hereafter as the unbelievers despair of those in tombs.
