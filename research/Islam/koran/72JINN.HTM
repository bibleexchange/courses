<p><h3>Book 72</h3>
<br><h3>The Jinn</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse72_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> It has been revealed to me that a party of the jinn  listened,
<br> and they said:
<br> Surely we have heard a wonderful  Quran,
<br>
<a name = "verse72_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Guiding to the right way,
<br> so we believe in it,
<br> and we  will not set up any one with our Lord:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And that He-- exalted be the majesty of our Lord-- has not  taken a consort,
<br> nor a son:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And that the foolish amongst us used to forge extravagant  things against Allah:
  <br>
<a name = "verse72_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  And that we thought that men and jinn did not utter a lie  against Allah:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And that persons from among men used to seek refuge with  persons from among jinn,
<br> so they increased them in  wrongdoing:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And that they thought as you think,
<br> that Allah would not  raise anyone:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And that we sought to reach heaven,
<br> but we found it  filled with strong guards and flaming stars.
<br>
<a name = "verse72_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And that we used to sit in some of the sitting-places  thereof to steal a hearing,
<br> but he who would (try to) listen  now would find a flame lying in wait for him:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And that we know not whether evil is meant for those who  are on earth or whether their Lord means to bring them good:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And that some of us are good and others of us are below  that:
<br> we are sects following different ways:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And that we know that we cannot escape Allah in the  earth,
<br> nor can we escape Him by flight:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And that when we heard the guidance,
<br> we believed in it;
<br>  so whoever believes in his Lord,
<br> he should neither fear loss  nor being overtaken (by disgrace):
<br>
<a name = "verse72_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And that some of us are those who submit,
<br> and some of us  are the deviators;
<br> so whoever submits,
<br> these aim at the  right way:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And as to the deviators,
<br> they are fuel of hell:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And that if they should keep to the (right) way,
<br> We  would certainly give them to drink of abundant water,
<br>
<a name = "verse72_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.17</b>]
<br>
<br> So that We might try them with respect to it;
<br> and  whoever turns aside from the reminder of his Lord,
<br> He will  make him enter into an afflicting chastisement:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And that the mosques are Allah's,
<br> therefore call not  upon any one with Allah:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And that when the servant of Allah stood up calling upon  Him,
<br> they wellnigh crowded him (to death).
<br>
<a name = "verse72_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I only call upon my Lord,
<br> and I do not associate  any one with Him.
<br>
<a name = "verse72_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I do not control for you evil or good.
<br>
<a name = "verse72_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Surely no one can protect me against Allah,
<br> nor can  I find besides Him any place of refuge:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.23</b>]
<br>
<br> (It is) only a delivering (of communications) from Allah  and His messages;
<br> and whoever disobeys Allah and His Apostle  surely he shall have the fire of hell to abide therein for a  long time.
<br>
<a name = "verse72_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when they see what they are threatened with,
<br> then  shall they know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in  number.
<br>
<a name = "verse72_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I do not know whether that with which you are  threatened be nigh or whether my Lord will appoint for it a  term:
<br>
<a name = "verse72_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.26</b>]
<br>
<br> The Knower of the unseen!
<br> so He does not reveal His  secrets to any,
<br>
<a name = "verse72_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Except to him whom He chooses as an apostle;
<br> for surely  He makes a guard to march before him and after him,
<br>
<a name = "verse72_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>72.28</b>]
<br>
<br> So that He may know that they have truly delivered the  messages of their Lord,
<br> and He encompasses what is with them  and He records the number of all things.
