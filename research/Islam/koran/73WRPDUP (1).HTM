<p><h3>Book 73</h3>
<br><h3>The Wrapped Up</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse73_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who have wrapped up in your garments!
<br>
<a name = "verse73_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Rise to pray in the night except a little,
<br>
<a name = "verse73_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Half of it,
<br> or lessen it a little,
<br>
<a name = "verse73_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Or add to it,
<br> and recite the Quran as it ought to be  recited.
  <br>
<a name = "verse73_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Surely We will make to light upon you a weighty Word.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the rising by night is the firmest way to tread  and the best corrective of speech.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely you have in the day time a long occupation.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to  Him with (exclusive) devotion.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.9</b>]
<br>
<br> The Lord of the East and the West-- there is no god but  He-- therefore take Him for a protector.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And bear patiently what they say and avoid them with a  becoming avoidance.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And leave Me and the rejecters,
<br> the possessors of ease  and plenty,
<br> and respite them a little.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely with Us are heavy fetters and a flaming fire,
<br>
<a name = "verse73_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And food that chokes and a painful punishment,
<br>
<a name = "verse73_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.14</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when the earth and the mountains shall quake  and the mountains shall become (as) heaps of sand let loose.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have sent to you an Apostle,
<br> a witness against  you,
<br> as We sent an apostle to Firon.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.16</b>]
<br>
<br> But Firon disobeyed the apostle,
<br> so We laid on him a  violent hold.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.17</b>]
<br>
<br> How,
<br> then,
<br> will you guard yourselves,
<br> if you disbelieve,
<br>  on the day which shall make children grey-headed?
<br>
<a name = "verse73_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.18</b>]
<br>
<br> The heaven shall rend asunder thereby;
<br> His promise is  ever brought to fulfillment.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely this is a reminder,
<br> then let him,
<br> who will take  the way to his Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse73_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>73.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely your Lord knows that you pass in prayer nearly  two-thirds of the night,
<br> and (sometimes) half of it,
<br> and  (sometimes) a third of it,
<br> and (also) a party of those with  you;
<br> and Allah measures the night and the day.
<br> He knows that  you are not able to do it,
<br> so He has turned to you  (mercifully),
<br> therefore read what is easy of the Quran.
<br> He  knows that there must be among you sick,
<br> and others who  travel in the land seeking of the bounty of Allah,
<br> and  others who fight in Allah's way,
<br> therefore read as much of  it as is easy (to you),
<br> and keep up prayer and pay the  poor-rate and offer to Allah a goodly gift,
<br> and whatever of  good you send on beforehand for yourselves,
<br> you will find it  with Allah;
<br> that is best and greatest in reward;
<br> and ask  forgiveness of Allah;
<br> surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
