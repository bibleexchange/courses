<p><h3>Book 44</h3>
<br><h3>The Smoke</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse44_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ha Mim!
<br>
<a name = "verse44_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.2</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the Book that makes manifest (the truth).
<br>
<a name = "verse44_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.3</b>]
<br>
 Surely We revealed it on a blessed night surely We are  ever warning--<br>
<a name = "verse44_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Therein every wise affair is made distinct,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.5</b>]
<br>
<br> A command from Us;
<br> surely We are the senders (of  apostles),
<br>
<a name = "verse44_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.6</b>]
<br>
<br> A mercy from your Lord,
<br> surely He is the Hearing,
<br> the  Knowing,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.7</b>]
<br>
<br> The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between  them,
<br> if you would be sure.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.8</b>]
<br>
<br> There is no god but He;
<br> He gives life and causes death,
<br>  your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> they are in doubt,
<br> they sport.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore keep waiting for the day when the heaven shall  bring an evident smoke,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.11</b>]
<br>
<br> That shall overtake men;
<br> this is a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Our Lord!
<br> remove from us the punishment;
<br> surely we are  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.13</b>]
<br>
<br> How shall they be reminded,
<br> and there came to them an  Apostle making clear (the truth),
<br>
<a name = "verse44_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Yet they turned their backs on him and said:
<br> One taught  (by others),
<br> a madman.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We will remove the punishment a little,
<br> (but) you  will surely return (to evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse44_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.16</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when We will seize (them) with the most  violent seizing;
<br> surely We will inflict retribution.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We tried before them the people of Firon,
<br>  and there came to them a noble apostle,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Saying:
<br> Deliver to me the servants of Allah,
<br> surely I am  a faithful apostle to you,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And that do not exalt yourselves against Allah,
<br> surely I  will bring to you a clear authority:
<br>
<a name = "verse44_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord that  you should stone me to death:
<br>
<a name = "verse44_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you do not believe in me,
<br> then leave me alone.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he called upon his Lord:
<br> These are a guilty people.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.23</b>]
<br>
<br> So go forth with My servants by night;
<br> surely you will  be pursued:
<br>
<a name = "verse44_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And leave the sea intervening;
<br> surely they are a host  that shall be drowned.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.25</b>]
<br>
<br> How many of the gardens and fountains have they left!
<br>
<a name = "verse44_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And cornfields and noble places!
<br>
<a name = "verse44_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And goodly things wherein they rejoiced;
<br>
<a name = "verse44_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus (it was),
<br> and We gave them as a heritage to another  people.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.29</b>]
<br>
<br> So the heaven and the earth did not weep for them,
<br> nor  were they respited.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We delivered the children of Israel from  the abasing chastisement,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.31</b>]
<br>
<br> From Firon;
<br> surely he was haughty,
<br> (and) one of the  extravagant.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We chose them,
<br> having knowledge,
<br> above the  nations.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave them of the communications wherein was clear  blessing.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely these do say:
<br>
<a name = "verse44_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.35</b>]
<br>
<br> There is naught but our first death and we shall not be  raised again.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.36</b>]
<br>
<br> So bring our fathers (back),
<br> if you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Are they better or the people of Tubba and those before  them?
<br> We destroyed them,
<br> for surely they were guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what  is between them in sport.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.39</b>]
<br>
<br> We did not create them both but with the truth,
<br> but most  of them do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the day of separation is their appointed term,
 of  all of them<br>
<a name = "verse44_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.41</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which a friend shall not avail (his) friend  aught,
<br> nor shall they be helped,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Save those on whom Allah shall have mercy;
<br> surely He is  the Mighty the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the tree of the Zaqqum,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.44</b>]
<br>
 Is the food of the sinful<br>
<a name = "verse44_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Like dregs of oil;
<br> it shall boil in (their) bellies,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Like the boiling of hot water.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Seize him,
<br> then drag him down into the middle of the  hell;
<br>
<a name = "verse44_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling  water:
<br>
<a name = "verse44_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Taste;
<br> you forsooth are the mighty,
<br> the honorable:
<br>
<a name = "verse44_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely this is what you disputed about.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.51</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who guard (against evil) are in a secure  place,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.52</b>]
<br>
<br> In gardens and springs;
<br>
<a name = "verse44_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.53</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall wear of fine and thick silk,
<br> (sitting) face  to face;
<br>
<a name = "verse44_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus (shall it be),
<br> and We will wed them with Houris  pure,
<br> beautiful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.55</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall call therein for every fruit in security;
<br>
<a name = "verse44_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.56</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall not taste therein death except the first  death,
<br> and He will save them from the punishment of the  hell,
<br>
<a name = "verse44_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.57</b>]
<br>
<br> A grace from your Lord;
<br> this is the great achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.58</b>]
<br>
<br> So have We made it easy in your tongue that they may be  mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse44_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>44.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore wait;
<br> surely they are waiting.
