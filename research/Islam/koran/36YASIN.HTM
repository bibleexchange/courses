<p><h3>Book 36</h3>
<br><h3>Yasin</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse36_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ya Seen.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.2</b>]
<br>
 I swear by the Quran full of wisdom<br>
<a name = "verse36_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.3</b>]
<br>
 Most surely you are one of the apostles<br>
<a name = "verse36_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.4</b>]
<br>
<br> On a right way.
  <br>
<a name = "verse36_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  A revelation of the Mighty,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.6</b>]
<br>
<br> That you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned,
<br>  so they are heedless.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly the word has proved true of most of them,
<br> so  they do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have placed chains on their necks,
<br> and these  reach up to their chins,
<br> so they have their heads raised  aloft.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have made before them a barrier and a barrier  behind them,
<br> then We have covered them over so that they do  not see.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is alike to them whether you warn them or warn  them not:
<br> they do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.11</b>]
<br>
<br> You can only warn him who follows the reminder and fears  the Beneficent God in secret;
<br> so announce to him forgiveness  and an honorable reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We give life to the dead,
<br> and We write down what  they have sent before and their footprints,
<br> and We have  recorded everything in a clear writing.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And set out to them an example of the people of the  town,
<br> when the messengers came to it.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.14</b>]
<br>
<br> When We sent to them two,
<br> they rejected both of them,
<br>  then We strengthened (them) with a third,
<br> so they said:
<br>  Surely we are messengers to you.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.15</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> You are naught but mortals like ourselves,
<br>  nor has the Beneficent God revealed anything;
<br> you only lie.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.16</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Our Lord knows that we are most surely  messengers to you.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And nothing devolves on us but a clear deliverance (of  the message).
<br>
<a name = "verse36_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.18</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Surely we augur evil from you;
<br> if you do not  desist,
<br> we will certainly stone you,
<br> and there shall  certainly afflict vou a painful chastisement from us.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.19</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Your evil fortune is with you;
<br> what!
<br> if you  are reminded!
<br> Nay,
<br> you are an extravagant people.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And from the remote part of the city there came a man  running,
<br> he said:
<br> O my people!
<br> follow the messengers;
<br>
<a name = "verse36_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Follow him who does not ask you for reward,
<br> and they are  the followers of the right course;
<br>
<a name = "verse36_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And what reason have I that I should not serve Him Who  brought me into existence?
<br> And to Him you shall be brought  back;
<br>
<a name = "verse36_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.23</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> shall I take besides Him gods whose intercession,
<br>  If the Beneficent God should desire to afflict me with a  harm,
<br> shall not avail me aught,
<br> nor shall they be able to  deliver me?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.24</b>]
<br>
<br> In that case I shall most surely be in clear error:
<br>    25 Surely I believe in your Lord,
<br> therefore hear me.
<br>    26 It was said:
<br> Enter the garden.
<br> He said:
 O would that my  people had known<br>
<a name = "verse36_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Of that on account of which my Lord has forgiven me and  made me of the honored ones!
<br>
<a name = "verse36_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not send down upon his people after him any  hosts from heaven,
<br> nor do We ever send down.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.29</b>]
<br>
<br> It was naught but a single cry,
<br> and lo!
<br> they were still.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Alas for the servants!
<br> there comes not to them an  apostle but they mock at him.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not consider how many of the generations have We  destroyed before them,
<br> because they do not turn to them?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And all of them shall surely be brought before Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And a sign to them is the dead earth:
<br> We give life to it  and bring forth from it grain SQ they eat of it.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And We make therein gardens of palms and grapevines and  We make springs to flow forth in it,
<br>
<a name = "verse36_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.35</b>]
<br>
<br> That they may eat of the fruit thereof,
<br> and their hands  did not make it;
<br> will they not then be grateful?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Glory be to Him Who created pairs of all things,
<br> of what  the earth grows,
<br> and of their kind and of what they do not  know.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And a sign to them is the night:
<br> We draw forth from it  the day,
<br> then lo!
<br> they are in the dark;
<br>
<a name = "verse36_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And the sun runs on to a term appointed for it;
<br> that is  the ordinance of the Mighty,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) the moon,
<br> We have ordained for it stages  till it becomes again as an old dry palm branch.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Neither is it allowable to the sun that it should  overtake the moon,
<br> nor can the night outstrip the day;
<br> and  all float on in a sphere.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in  the laden ship.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have created for them the like of it,
<br> what they  will ride on.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We please,
<br> We can drown them,
<br> then there shall be  no succorer for them,
 nor shall they be rescued<br>
<a name = "verse36_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.44</b>]
<br>
<br> But (by) mercy from Us and for enjoyment till a time.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them:
<br> Guard against what is  before you and what is behind you,
<br> that mercy may be had on  you.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And there comes not to them a communication of the  communications of their Lord but they turn aside from it.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them:
<br> Spend out of what Allah has  given you,
<br> those who disbelieve say to those who believe:
<br>  Shall we feed him whom,
<br> if Allah please,
<br> He could feed?
<br> You  are in naught but clear error.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> When will this threat come to pass,
<br> if you  are truthful?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.49</b>]
<br>
<br> They wait not for aught but a single cry which will  overtake them while they yet contend with one another.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.50</b>]
<br>
<br> So they shall not be able to make a bequest,
<br> nor shall  they return to their families.
<br>    51 .
<br> And the trumpet shall be blown,
<br> when lo !
<br> from their  graves they shall hasten on to their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.52</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> O woe to us!
<br> who has raised us up from  our sleeping-place?
<br> This is what the Beneficent God promised  and the apostles told the truth.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.53</b>]
<br>
<br> There would be naught but a single cry,
<br> when lo !
<br> they  shall all be brought before Us;
<br>
<a name = "verse36_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.54</b>]
<br>
<br> So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the  least;
<br> and you shall not be rewarded aught but that which  you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the dwellers of the garden shall on that day be  in an occupation quite happy.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.56</b>]
<br>
<br> They and their wives shall be in shades,
<br> reclining on  raised couches.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.57</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall have fruits therein,
<br> and they shall have  whatever they desire.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.58</b>]
<br>
<br> Peace:
<br> a word from a Merciful Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And get aside today,
<br> O guilty ones!
<br>
<a name = "verse36_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Did I not charge you,
<br> O children of Adam !
<br> that you  should not serve the Shaitan?
<br> Surely he is your open enemy,
<br>
<a name = "verse36_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And that you should serve Me;
<br> this is the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.62</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly he led astray numerous people from among  you.
<br> What!
<br> could you not then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.63</b>]
<br>
<br> This is the hell with which you were threatened.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Enter into it this day because you disbelieved.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.65</b>]
<br>
<br> On that day We will set a seal upon their mouths,
<br> and  their hands shall speak to Us,
<br> and their feet shall bear  witness of what they earned.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.66</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We please We would certainly put out their eyes,
<br>  then they would run about groping for the way,
<br> but how  should they see?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We please We would surely transform them in their  place,
<br> then they would not be able to go on,
<br> nor will they  return.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And whomsoever We cause to live long,
<br> We reduce (him) to  an abject state in constitution;
<br> do they not then  understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have not taught him poetry,
<br> nor is it meet for  him;
<br> it is nothing but a reminder and a plain Quran,
<br>
<a name = "verse36_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.70</b>]
<br>
<br> That it may warn him who would have life,
<br> and (that) the  word may prove true against the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.71</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not see that We have created cattle for them,
<br>  out of what Our hands have wrought,
<br> so they are their  masters?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have subjected them to them,
<br> so some of them they  have to ride upon,
<br> and some of them they eat.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And therein they have advantages and drinks;
<br> will they  not then be grateful?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be  helped.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.75</b>]
<br>
<br> (But) they shall not be able to assist them,
<br> and they  shall be a host brought up before them.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.76</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore let not their speech grieve you;
<br> surely We  know what they do in secret and what they do openly.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.77</b>]
<br>
<br> Does not man see that We have created him from the small  seed?
<br> Then lo!
<br> he is an open disputant.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And he strikes out a likeness for Us and forgets his own  creation.
<br> Says he:
<br> Who will give life to the bones when they  are rotten?
<br>
<a name = "verse36_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.79</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> He will give life to them Who brought them into  existence at first,
 and He is cognizant of all creation<br>
<a name = "verse36_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.80</b>]
<br>
<br> He Who has made for you the fire (to burn) from the  green tree,
<br> so that with it you kindle (fire).
<br>
<a name = "verse36_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to  create the like of them?
<br> Yea!
<br> and He is the Creator (of  all),
<br> the Knower.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.82</b>]
<br>
<br> His command,
<br> when He intends anything,
<br> is only to say to  it:
<br> Be,
<br> so it is.
<br>
<a name = "verse36_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>36.83</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore glory be to Him in Whose hand is the kingdom  of all things,
<br> and to Him you shall be brought back.
