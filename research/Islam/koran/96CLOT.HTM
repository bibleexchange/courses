<p><h3>Book 96</h3>
<br><h3>The Clot</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse96_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Read in the name of your Lord Who created.
<br>
<a name = "verse96_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.2</b>]
<br>
<br> He created man from a clot.
<br>
<a name = "verse96_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Read and your Lord is Most Honorable,
<br>
<a name = "verse96_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.4</b>]
<br>
 Who taught (to write) with the pen<br>
<a name = "verse96_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Taught man what he knew not.
<br>
<a name = "verse96_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> man is most surely inordinate,
<br>
<a name = "verse96_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Because he sees himself free from want.
<br>
<a name = "verse96_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely to your Lord is the return.
<br>
<a name = "verse96_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.9</b>]
<br>
 Have you seen him who forbids<br>
<a name = "verse96_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.10</b>]
<br>
<br> A servant when he prays?
<br>
<a name = "verse96_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you considered if he were on the right way,
<br>
<a name = "verse96_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Or enjoined guarding (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse96_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you considered if he gives the lie to the truth and  turns (his) back?
<br>
<a name = "verse96_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Does he not know that Allah does see?
<br>
<a name = "verse96_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> if he desist not,
<br> We would certainly smite his  forehead,
<br>
<a name = "verse96_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.16</b>]
<br>
<br> A lying,
<br> sinful forehead.
<br>    17 Then let him summon his council,
<br>
<a name = "verse96_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.18</b>]
<br>
<br> We too would.
<br>summon the braves of the army.
<br>
<a name = "verse96_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>96.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> obey him not,
<br> and make obeisance and draw nigh (to  Allah).
