<p><h3>Book 15</h3>
<br><h3>The Rock</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse15_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Ra.
<br> These are the verses of the Book and (of) a  Quran that makes (things) clear.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Often will those who disbelieve wish that they had been  Muslims.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Leave them that they may eat and enjoy themselves and  (that) hope may beguile them,
<br> for they will soon know.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And never did We destroy a town but it had a term made  known.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.5</b>]
<br>
<br> No people can hasten on their doom nor can they postpone  (it).
<br>
<a name = "verse15_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> O you to whom the Reminder has been  revealed!
<br> you are most surely insane:
<br>
<a name = "verse15_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Why do you not bring to us the angels if you are of the  truthful ones?
<br>
<a name = "verse15_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.8</b>]
<br>
<br> We do not send the angels but with truth,
<br> and then they  would not be respited.
<br>    9 Surely We have revealed the Reminder and We will most  surely be its guardian.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent (apostles) before you among the  nations of yore.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And there never came an apostle to them but they mocked  him.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus do We make it to enter into the hearts of the  guilty;
<br>
<a name = "verse15_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.13</b>]
<br>
<br> They do not believe in it,
<br> and indeed the example of the  former people has already passed.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And even if We open to them a gateway of heaven,
<br> so that  they ascend into it all the while,
<br>
<a name = "verse15_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.15</b>]
<br>
<br> They would certainly say:
<br> Only our eyes.
<br>have been  covered over,
<br> rather we are an enchanted people.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have made strongholds in the heaven and  We have made it fair seeming to the beholders.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And We guard it against every accursed Shaitan,
<br>
<a name = "verse15_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.18</b>]
<br>
<br> But he who steals a hearing,
<br> so there follows him a  visible flame.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And the earth-- We have spread it forth and made in it  firm mountains and caused to grow in it of every suitable  thing.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have made in it means of subsistence for you and  for him for whom you are not the suppliers.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And there is not a thing but with Us are the treasures  of it,
<br> and We do not send it down but in a known measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And We send the winds fertilizing,
<br> then send down water  from the cloud so We give it to you to drink of,
<br> nor is it  you who store it up.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely We bring to life and cause to die and We  are the heirs.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We know those of you who have gone before  and We certainly know those who shall come later.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely your Lord will gather them together;
<br> surely  He is Wise,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We created man of clay that gives forth  sound,
<br> of black mud fashioned in shape.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And the jinn We created before,
<br> of intensely hot fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And when your Lord said to the angels:
<br> Surely I am going  to create a mortal of the essence of black mud fashioned in  shape.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.29</b>]
<br>
<br> So when I have made him complete and breathed into him  of My spirit,
<br> fall down making obeisance to him.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.30</b>]
<br>
<br> So the angels made obeisance,
<br> all of them together,
<br>
<a name = "verse15_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.31</b>]
<br>
<br> But Iblis (did it not);
<br> he refused to be with those who  made obeisance.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.32</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O Iblis!
<br> what excuse have you that you are not  with those who make obeisance?
<br>
<a name = "verse15_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.33</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> I am not such that I should make obeisance to a  mortal whom Thou hast created of the essence of black mud  fashioned in shape.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.34</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Then get out of it,
<br> for surely you are driven  away:
<br>
<a name = "verse15_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely on you is curse until the day of judgment.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.36</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> then respite me till the time when  they are raised.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.37</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
 So surely you are of the respited ones<br>
<a name = "verse15_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Till the period of the time made known.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.39</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> because Thou hast made life evil to  me,
<br> I will certainly make (evil) fair-seeming to them on  earth,
 and I will certainly cause them all to deviate<br>
<a name = "verse15_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Except Thy servants from among them,
<br> the devoted ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.41</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> This is a right way with Me:
<br>
<a name = "verse15_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely.
<br> as regards My servants,
<br> you have no authority  ,
<br>over them except those who follow you of the deviators.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely Hell is the promised place of them all:
<br>
<a name = "verse15_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.44</b>]
<br>
<br> It has seven gates;
<br> for every gate there shall be a  separate party of them.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in the  midst of gardens and fountains:
<br>
<a name = "verse15_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Enter them in peace,
<br> secure.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And We will root out whatever of rancor is in their  breasts-- (they shall be) as brethren,
<br> on raised couches,
<br> face  to face.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Toil shall not afflict them in it,
<br> nor shall they be  ever ejected from it.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving,
<br> the  Merciful,
<br>
<a name = "verse15_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And that My punishment-- that is the painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And inform them of the guests of Ibrahim:
<br>
<a name = "verse15_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.52</b>]
<br>
<br> When they entered upon him,
<br> they said,
<br> Peace.
<br> He said:
<br>  Surely we are afraid of you.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.53</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Be not afraid,
<br> surely we give you the good  news of a boy,
<br> possessing knowledge.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.54</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Do you give me good news (of a son) when old  age has come upon me?
<br>-- Of what then do you give me good  news!
<br>
<a name = "verse15_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.55</b>]
<br>
<br> .
<br> They said:
<br> We give you good news with truth,
<br>  therefore be not of the despairing.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.56</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord but  the erring ones?
<br>
<a name = "verse15_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.57</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> What is your business then,
<br> O messengers?
<br>
<a name = "verse15_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.58</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Surely we are sent towards a guilty people,
<br>
<a name = "verse15_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Except Lut's followers:
<br> We will most surely deliver them  all,
<br>
<a name = "verse15_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.60</b>]
<br>
<br> Except his wife;
<br> We ordained that she shall surely be of  those who remain behind.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.61</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the messengers came to Lut's followers,
<br>
<a name = "verse15_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.62</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely you are an unknown people.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.63</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Nay,
<br> we have come to you with that about  which they disputed.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.64</b>]
<br>
<br> And we have come to you with the truth,
<br> and we are most  surely truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore go forth with your followers in a part of the  night and yourself follow their rear,
<br> and let not any one of  you turn round,
<br> and go forth whither you are commanded.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.66</b>]
<br>
<br> And We revealed to him this decree,
<br> that the roots of  these shall be cut off in the morning.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And the people of the town came rejoicing.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.68</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely these are my guests,
<br> therefore do not  disgrace me,
<br>
<a name = "verse15_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.69</b>]
<br>
<br> And guard against (the punishment of) Allah and do not  put me to shame.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.70</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Have we not forbidden you from (other)  people?
<br>
<a name = "verse15_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.71</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> These are my daughters,
<br> if you will do (aught).
<br>
<a name = "verse15_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.72</b>]
<br>
<br> By your life!
<br> they were blindly wandering on in their  intoxication.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.73</b>]
<br>
<br> So the rumbling overtook them (while) entering upon the  time of sunrise;
<br>
<a name = "verse15_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.74</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus did We turn it upside down,
<br> and rained down upon  them stones of what had been decreed.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.75</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely in this are signs for those who examine.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.76</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely it is on a road that still abides.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.77</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is a sign in this for the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And the dwellers of the thicket also were most surely  unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.79</b>]
<br>
<br> So We inflicted retribution on them,
<br> and they are both,
<br>  indeed,
<br> on an open road (still) pursued.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And the dwellers of the Rock certainly rejected the  messengers;
<br>
<a name = "verse15_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.81</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave them Our communications,
<br> but they turned  aside from them;
<br>
<a name = "verse15_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And they hewed houses in the mountains in security.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.83</b>]
<br>
<br> So the rumbling overtook them in the morning;
<br>
<a name = "verse15_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.84</b>]
<br>
<br> And what they earned did not avail them.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.85</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what  is between them two but in truth;
<br> and the hour is most  surely coming,
<br> so turn away with kindly forgiveness.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.86</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely your Lord is the Creator of all things,
<br> the  Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.87</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have given you seven of the  oft-repeated (verses) and the grand Quran.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.88</b>]
<br>
<br> Do not strain your eyes after what We have given certain  classes of them to enjoy,
<br> and do not grieve for them,
<br> and  make yourself gentle to the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.89</b>]
<br>
<br> And say:
<br> Surely I am the plain warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.90</b>]
<br>
 Like as We sent down on the dividers<br>
<a name = "verse15_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.91</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who made the Quran into shreds.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.92</b>]
<br>
<br> So,
<br> by your Lord,
<br> We would most certainly question them  all,
<br>
<a name = "verse15_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.93</b>]
<br>
<br> As to what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.94</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore declare openly what you are bidden and turn  aside from the polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.95</b>]
<br>
 Surely We will suffice you against the scoffers<br>
<a name = "verse15_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.96</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who set up another god with Allah;
<br> so they shall  soon know.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.97</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely We know that your breast straitens at what  they say;
<br>
<a name = "verse15_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.98</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore celebrate the praise of your Lord,
<br> and be of  those who make obeisance.
<br>
<a name = "verse15_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>15.99</b>]
<br>
<br> And serve your Lord until there comes to you that which  is certain.
