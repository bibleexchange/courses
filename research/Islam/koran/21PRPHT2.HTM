<p><h3>Book 21</h3>
<br><h3>The Prophets</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse21_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Their reckoning has drawn near to men,
<br> and in  heedlessness are they turning aside.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.2</b>]
<br>
<br> There comes not to them a new reminder from their Lord  but they hear it while they sport,
<br>
<a name = "verse21_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Their hearts trifling;
<br> and those who are unjust counsel  together in secret:
<br> He is nothing but a mortal like  yourselves;
<br> what!
<br> will you then yield to enchantment while  you see?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.4</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord knows what is spoken in the heaven and  the earth,
<br> and He is the Hearing,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> say they:
<br> Medleys of dreams;
<br> nay!
<br> he has forged it;
<br>  nay!
<br> he is a poet;
<br> so let him bring to us a sign as the  former (prophets) were sent (with).
<br>
<a name = "verse21_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.6</b>]
<br>
<br> There did not believe before them any town which We  destroyed,
<br> will they then believe?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not send before you any but men to whom We  sent revelation,
 so ask the followers of the reminder if you  do not<br>
<a name = "verse21_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not make them bodies not eating the food,
<br> and  they were not to abide (forever).
<br>
<a name = "verse21_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We made Our promise good to them,
<br> so We delivered  them and those whom We pleased,
 and We destroyed the ex<br>
<a name = "verse21_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly We have revealed to you a Book in which is  your good remembrance;
<br> what!
<br> do you not then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many a town which was iniquitous did We  demolish,
<br> and We raised up after it another people!
<br>
<a name = "verse21_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.12</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they felt Our punishment,
<br> lo!
 they began to fly<br>
<a name = "verse21_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Do not fly (now) and come back to what you were made to  lead easy lives in and to your dwellings,
<br> haply you will be  questioned.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.14</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O woe to us!
<br> surely we were unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.15</b>]
<br>
 And this ceased not to be their cry till We made them  cut<br>
<a name = "verse21_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what  is between them for sport.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Had We wished to make a diversion,
<br> We would have made it  from before Ourselves:
<br> by no means would We do (it).
<br>
<a name = "verse21_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> We cast the truth against the falsehood,
<br> so that it  breaks its head,
<br> and lo!
<br> it vanishes;
<br> and woe to you for  what you describe;
<br>
<a name = "verse21_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever is in the heavens and the earth is His;
<br> and  those who are with Him are not proud to serve Him,
<br> nor do  they grow weary.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.20</b>]
<br>
<br> They glorify (Him) by night and day;
<br> they are never  languid.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they taken gods from the earth who raise (the  dead).
<br>
<a name = "verse21_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.22</b>]
<br>
<br> If there had been in them any gods except Allah,
<br> they  would both have certainly been in a state of disorder;
<br>  therefore glory be to Allah,
<br> the Lord of the dominion,
<br> above  what they attribute (to Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse21_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.23</b>]
<br>
<br> He cannot be questioned concerning what He does and they  shall be questioned.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> have they taken gods besides Him?
<br> Say:
<br> Bring your  proof;
<br> this is the reminder of those with me and the  reminder of those before me.
<br> Nay!
<br> most of them do not know  the truth,
<br> so they turn aside.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not send before you any apostle but We  revealed to him that there is no god but Me,
<br> therefore serve  Me.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> The Beneficent God has taken to Himself a  !
<br> son.
<br> Glory be to Him.
<br> Nay!
 they are honored servants<br>
<a name = "verse21_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.27</b>]
<br>
<br> They do not precede Him in speech and (only) according  to His commandment do they act.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.28</b>]
<br>
<br> He knows what is before them and what is behind them,
<br>  and they do not intercede except for him whom He approves  and for fear of Him they tremble.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever of them should say:
<br> Surely I am a god  besides Him,
<br> such a one do We recompense with hell;
<br> thus do,
<br>  We recompense the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the  earth were closed up,
<br> but We have opened them;
<br> and We have  made of water everything living,
<br> will they not then believe?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have made great mountains in the earth lest it  might be convulsed with them,
<br> and We have made in it wide  ways that they may follow a right direction.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have made the heaven a guarded canopy and (yet)  they turn aside from its signs.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who created the night and the day and the  sun and the moon;
<br> all (orbs) travel along swiftly in their  celestial spheres.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not ordain abiding for any mortal before you.
<br>  What!
<br> Then if you die,
<br> will they abide?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Every soul must taste of death and We try you by evil  and good by way of probation;
<br> and to Us you shall be brought  back.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And when those who disbelieve see you,
<br> they do not take  you but for one to be scoffed at:
<br> Is this he who speaks of  your gods?
<br> And they are deniers at the mention of the  Beneficent God.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Man is created of haste;
<br> now will I show to you My  signs,
<br> therefore do not ask Me to hasten (them) on.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> When will this threat come to pass if you  are truthful?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Had those who disbelieve but known (of the time) when  they shall not be able to ward off the fire from their faces  nor from their backs,
<br> nor shall they be helped.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> it shall come on them all of a sudden and cause  them to become confounded,
<br> so they shall not have the power  to avert it,
<br> nor shall they be respited.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly apostles before you were scoffed at,
<br> then  there befell those of them who scoffed that at which they  had scoffed.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Who guards you by night and by day from the  Beneficent God?
<br> Nay,
<br> they turn aside at the mention of their  Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> have they gods who can defend them against Us?
<br> They  shall not be able to assist themselves,
<br> nor shall they be  defended from Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> We gave provision to these and their fathers until  life was prolonged to them.
<br> Do they not then see that We are  visiting the land,
<br> curtailing it of its sides?
<br> Shall they  then prevail?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I warn you only by revelation;
<br> and the deaf do not  hear the call whenever they are warned.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And if a blast of the chastisement of your Lord were to  touch them,
<br> they will certainly say:
<br> O woe to us!
<br> surely we  were unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And We will set up a just balance on the day of  resurrection,
<br> so no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the  least;
<br> and though there be the weight of a grain of mustard  seed,
<br> (yet) will We bring it,
<br> and sufficient are We to take  account.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave to Musa and Haroun the Furqan and  a light and a reminder for those who would guard (against  evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse21_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.49</b>]
<br>
<br> (For) those who fear their Lord in secret and they are  fearful of the hour.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And this is a blessed Reminder which We have revealed;
<br>  will you then deny it?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave to Ibrahim his rectitude before,
<br>  and We knew him fully well.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.52</b>]
<br>
<br> When he said to his father and his people:
<br> What are  these images to whose worship you cleave?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.53</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We found our fathers worshipping them.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.54</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Certainly you have been,
<br> (both) you and your  fathers,
<br> in manifest error.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.55</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Have you brought to us the truth,
<br> or are you  one of the triflers?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.56</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Nay!
<br> your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and  the earth,
<br> Who brought them into existence,
<br> and I am of  those who bear witness to this:
<br>
<a name = "verse21_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> by Allah!
<br> I will certainly do something against  your idols after you go away,
<br> turning back.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.58</b>]
<br>
<br> So he broke them into pieces,
<br> except the chief of them,
<br>  that haply they may return to it.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.59</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Who has done this to our gods?
<br> Most surely he  is one of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.60</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We heard a youth called Ibrahim speak of  them.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.61</b>]
<br>
<br> Said they:
<br> Then bring him before the eyes of the people,
<br>  perhaps they may bear witness.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.62</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Have you done this to our gods,
<br> O Ibrahim?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.63</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely (some doer) has done it;
<br> the chief of  them is this,
<br> therefore ask them,
<br> if they can speak.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Then they turned to themselves and said:
<br> Surely you  yourselves are the unjust;
<br>
<a name = "verse21_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Then they were made to hang down their heads:
<br> Certainly  you know that they do not speak.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.66</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br>.
<br>What!
<br> do you then serve besides Allah what  brings you not any benefit at all,
<br> nor does it harm you?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.67</b>]
<br>
<br> Fie on you and on what you serve besides Allah;
<br> what!
<br> do  you not then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse21_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.68</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Burn him and help your gods,
<br> if you are going  to do (anything).
<br>
<a name = "verse21_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.69</b>]
<br>
<br> We said:
<br> O fire!
<br> be a comfort and peace to Ibrahim;
<br>
<a name = "verse21_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.70</b>]
<br>
<br> And they desired a war on him,
<br> but We made them the  greatest losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And We delivered him as well as Lut (removing them) to  the land which We had blessed for all people.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave him Ishaq and Yaqoub,
<br> a son's son,
<br> and We  made (them) all good.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made them Imams who guided (people) by Our  command,
<br> and We revealed to them the doing of good and the  keeping up of prayer and the giving of the alms,
<br> and Us  (alone) did they serve;
<br>
<a name = "verse21_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) Lut,
<br> We gave him wisdom and knowledge,
<br> and  We delivered him from the town which wrought abominations;
<br>  surely they were an evil people,
<br> transgressors;
<br>
<a name = "verse21_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.75</b>]
<br>
<br> And We took him into Our mercy;
<br> surely he was of the  good.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.76</b>]
<br>
<br> And Nuh,
<br> when he cried aforetime,
<br> so We answered him,
<br>  and delivered him and his followers from the great calamity.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.77</b>]
<br>
<br> And We helped him against the people who rejected Our  communications;
<br> surely they were an evil people,
<br> so We  drowned them all.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And Dawood and Sulaiman when they gave judgment  concerning the field when the people's sheep pastured  therein by night,
<br> and We were bearers of witness to their  judgment.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.79</b>]
<br>
<br> So We.
<br>made Sulaiman to understand it;
<br> and to each one We  gave wisdom and knowledge;
<br> and We made the mountains,
<br> and  the birds to celebrate Our praise with Dawood;
<br> and We were  the doers.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you,
<br>  that they might protect you in your wars;
<br> will you then be  grateful?
<br>    81 .
<br> And (We made subservient) to Sulaiman the wind blowing  violent,
<br> pursuing its course by his command to the land  which We had blessed,
<br> and We are knower of ail things.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And of the rebellious people there were those who dived  for him and did other work besides that,
<br> and We kept guard  over them;
<br>
<a name = "verse21_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.83</b>]
<br>
<br> And Ayub,
<br> when he cried to his Lord,
<br> (saying):
<br> Harm has  afflicted me,
<br> and Thou art the most Merciful of the  merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.84</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore We responded to him and took off what harm he  had,
<br> and We gave him his family and the like of them with  them:
<br> a mercy from Us and a reminder to the worshippers.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.85</b>]
<br>
<br> And Ismail and Idris and Zulkifl;
<br> all were of the  patient ones;
<br>
<a name = "verse21_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.86</b>]
<br>
<br> And We caused them to enter into Our mercy,
<br> surely they  were of the good ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.87</b>]
<br>
<br> And Yunus,
<br> when he went away in wrath,
<br> so he thought  that We would not straiten him,
<br> so he called out among  afflictions:
<br> There is no god but Thou,
<br> glory be to Thee;
<br>  surely I am of those who make themselves to suffer loss.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.88</b>]
<br>
<br> So We responded to him and delivered him from the grief  and thus do We deliver the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.89</b>]
<br>
<br> And Zakariya,
<br> when he cried to his Lord:
<br> O my Lord leave  me not alone;
<br> and Thou art the best of inheritors.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>21.90</b>]
<br>
<br> So We responded to him and gave him Yahya and made his  wife fit for him;
<br> surely they used to hasten,
<br> one with  another In deeds of goodness and to call upon Us,
<br> hoping and  fearing and they were humble before Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse21_90"></a>
<p>
