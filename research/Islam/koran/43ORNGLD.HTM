<p><h3>Book 43</h3>
<br><h3>Ornaments of Gold</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse43_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ha Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.2</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the Book that makes things clear:
<br>
<a name = "verse43_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have made it an Arabic Quran that you may  understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely it is in the original of the Book with Us,
<br>  truly elevated,
<br> full of wisdom.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.5</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> shall We then turn away the reminder from you  altogether because you are an extravagant people?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many a prophet have We sent among the ancients.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And there came not to them a prophet but they mocked at  him.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We destroyed those who were stronger than these in  prowess,
<br> and the case of the ancients has gone before,
<br>
<a name = "verse43_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you should ask them,
<br> Who created the heavens and  the earth?
<br> they would most certainly say:
<br> The Mighty,
<br> the  Knowing One,
<br> has created them;
<br>
<a name = "verse43_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.10</b>]
<br>
<br> He Who made the earth a resting-place for you,
<br> and made  in it ways for you that you may go aright;
<br>
<a name = "verse43_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And He Who sends down water from the cloud according to  a measure,
<br> then We raise to life thereby a dead country,
<br>  even thus shall you be brought forth;
<br>
<a name = "verse43_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And He Who created pairs of all things,
<br> and made for you  of the ships and the cattle what you ride on,
<br>
<a name = "verse43_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.13</b>]
<br>
<br> That you may firmly sit on their backs,
<br> then remember  the favor of your Lord when you are firmly seated thereon,
<br>  and say:
 Glory be to Him Who made this subservient to us and  we were not able to do it<br>
<a name = "verse43_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely to our Lord we must return.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And they assign to Him a part of His servants;
<br> man,
<br> to  be sure,
<br> is clearly ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.16</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> has He taken daughters to Himself of what He  Himself creates and chosen you to have sons?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And when one of them is given news of that of which he  sets up as a likeness for the Beneficent God,
<br> his face  becomes black and he is full of rage.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.18</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> that which is made in ornaments and which in  contention is unable to make plain speech!
<br>
<a name = "verse43_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And they make the angels-- them who are the servants of  the Beneficent God-- female (divinities).
<br> What!
<br> did they  witness their creation?
<br> Their evidence shall be written down  and they shall be questioned.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> If the Beneficent God had pleased,
<br> we  should never have worshipped them.
<br> They have no knowledge of  this;
<br> they only lie.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have We given them a book before it so that they hold  fast to it?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> they say:
<br> We found our fathers on a course,
<br> and  surely we are guided by their footsteps.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus,
<br> We did not send before you any warner in a  town,
<br> but those who led easy lives in it said:
<br> Surely we  found our fathers on a course,
<br> and surely we are followers  of their footsteps.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.24</b>]
<br>
<br> (The warner) said:
<br> What!
<br> even if I bring to you a better  guide than that on which you found your fathers?
<br> They said:
<br>    Surely we are unbelievers in that with which you are sent.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.25</b>]
<br>
<br> So We inflicted retribution on them,
<br> then see how was  the end of the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Ibrahim said to his father and his people:
<br>  Surely I am clear of what you worship,
<br>
<a name = "verse43_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Save Him Who created me,
<br> for surely He will guide me.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And he made it a word to continue in his posterity that  they may return.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> I gave them and their fathers to enjoy until there  came to them the truth and an Apostle making manifest (the  truth).
<br>
<a name = "verse43_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And when there came to them the truth they said:
<br> This is  magic,
<br> and surely we are disbelievers in it.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> I gave them and their fathers to enjoy until there  came to them the truth and an Apostle making manifest (the  truth).
<br>
<a name = "verse43_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And when there came to them the truth they said:
<br> This is  magic,
<br> and surely we are disbelievers in it.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Why was not this Quran revealed to a man  of importance in the two towns?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Will they distribute the mercy of your Lord?
<br> We  distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this  world,
<br> and We j have exalted some of them above others in  degrees,
<br> that some of them may take others in subjection;
<br>  and the mercy of your Lord is better than what they amass.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And were it not that all people had been a single  nation,
<br> We would certainly have assigned to those who  disbelieve in the Beneficent God (to make) of silver the  roofs of their houses and the stairs by which they ascend.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And the doors of their houses and the couches on which  they recline,
<br>
<a name = "verse43_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And (other) embellishments of gold;
<br> and all this is  naught but provision of this world's life,
<br> and the hereafter  is with your Lord only for those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse43_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever turns himself away from the remembrance of  the Beneficent God,
<br> We appoint for him a Shaitan,
<br> so he  becomes his associate.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely they turn them away from the path,
<br> and  they think that they are guided aright:
<br>
<a name = "verse43_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Until when he comes to Us,
<br> he says:
<br> O would that between  me and you there were the distance of the East and the West;
<br>  so evil is the associate!
<br>
<a name = "verse43_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And since you were unjust,
<br> it will not profit you this  day that you are sharers in the chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.40</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> can you then make the deaf to hear or guide the  blind and him who is in clear error?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.41</b>]
<br>
<br> But if We should take you away,
<br> still We shall inflict  retribution on them;
<br>
<a name = "verse43_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Rather We will certainly show you that which We have  promised them;
<br> for surely We are the possessors of full  power over them.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore hold fast to that which has been revealed to  you;
<br> surely you are on the right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely it is a reminder for you and your  people,
<br> and you shall soon be questioned.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And ask those of Our apostles whom We sent before you:
<br>  Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the  Beneficent God?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications to  Firon and his chiefs,
<br> so he said:
<br> Surely I am the apostle of  the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.47</b>]
<br>
<br> But when he came to them with Our signs,
<br> lo!
<br> they  laughed at them.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not show them a sign but it was greater than  its like,
<br> and We overtook them with chastisement that they  may turn.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And they said:
<br> O magician!
<br> call on your Lord for our  sake,
<br> as He has made the covenant with you;
<br> we shall surely  be the followers of the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.50</b>]
<br>
<br> But when We removed from them the chastisement,
<br> lo!
<br> they  broke the pledge.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon proclaimed amongst his people:
<br> O my people!
<br> is  not the kingdom of Egypt mine?
<br> And these rivers flow beneath  me;
<br> do you not then see?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.52</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> I am better than this fellow,
<br> who is contemptible,
<br>  and who can hardly speak distinctly:
<br>
<a name = "verse43_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.53</b>]
<br>
<br> But why have not bracelets of gold been put upon him,
<br> or  why have there not come with him angels as companions?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.54</b>]
<br>
<br> So he incited his people to levity and they obeyed him:
<br>  surely they were a transgressing people.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Then when they displeased Us,
<br> We inflicted a retribution  on them,
<br> so We drowned them all together,
<br>
<a name = "verse43_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made them a precedent and example to the later  generations.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And when a description of the son of Marium is given,
<br>  lo!
<br> your people raise a clamor thereat.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Are our gods better,
<br> or is he?
<br> They do not  set it forth to you save by way of disputation;
<br> nay,
<br> they  are a contentious people.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.59</b>]
<br>
<br> He was naught but a servant on whom We bestowed favor,
<br>  and We made him an example for the children of Israel.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We please,
<br> We could make among you angels to be  successors in the land.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely it is a knowledge of the hour,
<br> therefore  have no doubt about it and follow me:
<br> this is the right  path.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.62</b>]
<br>
<br> And let not the Shaitan prevent you;
<br> surely he is your j  open enemy.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.63</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Isa came with clear arguments he said:
<br> I have  come to you indeed with wisdom,
<br> and that I may make clear to  you part of what you differ in;
<br> so be careful of (your duty  to) Allah and obey me:
<br>
<a name = "verse43_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord,
<br> therefore serve  Him;
<br> this is the right path:
<br>
<a name = "verse43_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.65</b>]
<br>
<br> But parties from among them differed,
<br> so woe to those  who were unjust because of the chastisement of a painful  day.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they wait for aught but the hour,
<br> that it should come  !
<br> upon them all of a sudden while they do not perceive?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.67</b>]
<br>
<br> The friends shall on that day be enemies one to another,
<br>  except those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse43_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.68</b>]
<br>
<br> O My servants!
<br> there is no fear for you this day,
<br> nor  shall you grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who believed in Our communications and were  submissive:
<br>
<a name = "verse43_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.70</b>]
<br>
<br> Enter the garden,
<br> you and your wives;
<br> you shall be made  happy.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.71</b>]
<br>
<br> There shall be sent round to them golden bowls and  drinking-cups and therein shall be what their souls yearn  after and (wherein) the eyes shall delight,
<br> and you shall  abide therein.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And this is the garden which you are given as an  inheritance on account of what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.73</b>]
<br>
<br> For you therein are many fruits of which you shall eat.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.74</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the guilty shall abide in the chastisement of  hell.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.75</b>]
<br>
<br> It shall not be abated from them and they shall therein  be despairing.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.76</b>]
<br>
<br> And We are not unjust to them,
<br> but they themselves were  unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.77</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall call out:
<br> O Malik!
<br> let your Lord make an  end of us.
<br> He shall say:
<br> Surely you shall tarry.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.78</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly We have brought you the truth,
<br> but most of you  are averse to the truth.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.79</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they settled an affair?
<br> Then surely We are the  settlers.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.80</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they think that We do not hear what they conceal  and their secret discourses?
<br> Aye!
<br> and Our messengers with  them write down.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If the Beneficent God has a son,
<br> I am the foremost  of those who serve.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.82</b>]
<br>
<br> Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth,
<br> the Lord  of power,
<br> from what they describe.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.83</b>]
<br>
<br> So leave them plunging into false discourses and  sporting until they meet their day which they are threatened  with.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.84</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who is God in the heavens and God in the  earth;
<br> and He is the Wise,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.85</b>]
<br>
<br> And blessed is He Whose is the kingdom of the heavens  and the earth and what is between them,
<br> and with Him is the  knowledge of the hour,
<br> and to Him shall you be brought back.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.86</b>]
<br>
<br> And those whom they call upon besides Him have no  authority for intercession,
<br> but he who bears witness of the  truth and they know (him).
<br>
<a name = "verse43_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.87</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you should ask them who created them,
<br> they would  certainly say:
<br> Allah.
<br> Whence are they then turned back?
<br>
<a name = "verse43_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.88</b>]
<br>
<br> Consider his cry:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> surely they are a people  who do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse43_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>43.89</b>]
<br>
<br> So turn away from them and say,
<br> Peace,
<br> for they shall  soon come to know.
