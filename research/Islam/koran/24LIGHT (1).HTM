<p><h3>Book 24</h3>
<br><h3>The Light</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse24_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.1</b>]
<br>
<br> (This is) a chapter which We have revealed and made  obligatory and in which We have revealed clear  communications that you may be mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.2</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) the fornicatress and the fornicator,
<br> flog each  of them,
<br> (giving) a hundred stripes,
<br> and let not pity for  them detain you in the matter of obedience to Allah,
<br> if you  believe in Allah and the last day,
<br> and let a party of  believers witness their chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.3</b>]
<br>
<br> The fornicator shall not marry any but a fornicatress or  idolatress,
<br> and (as for) the fornicatress,
<br> none shall marry  her but a fornicator or an idolater;
<br> and it is forbidden to  the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who accuse free women then do not bring four  witnesses,
<br> flog them,
<br> (giving) eighty stripes,
<br> and do not  admit any evidence from them ever;
<br> and these it is that are  the transgressors,
<br>
<a name = "verse24_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Except those who repent after this and act aright,
<br> for  surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who accuse their wives and have no  witnesses except themselves,
<br> the evidence of one of these  (should be taken) four times,
<br> bearing Allah to witness that  he is most surely of the truthful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And the fifth (time) that the curse of Allah be on him if  he is one of the liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And it shall avert the chastisement from her if she  testify four times,
<br> bearing Allah to witness that he is most  surely one of the liars;
<br>
<a name = "verse24_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And the fifth (time) that the wrath of Allah be on her if  he is one of the truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And were it not for Allah's grace upon you and His  mercy-- and that Allah is Oft-returning (to mercy),
<br> Wise!
<br>
<a name = "verse24_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they who concocted the lie are a party from among  you.
<br> Do not regard it an evil to you;
<br> nay,
<br> it is good for  you.
<br> Every man of them shall have what he has earned of sin;
<br>  and (as for) him who took upon himself the main part  thereof,
<br> he shall have a grievous chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Why did not the believing men and the believing women,
<br>  when you heard it,
<br> think well of their own people,
<br> and say:
<br>  This is an evident falsehood?
<br>
<a name = "verse24_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Why did they not bring four witnesses of it?
<br> But as they  have not brought witnesses they are liars before Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And were it not for Allah's grace upon you and His mercy  in this world and the hereafter,
<br> a grievous chastisement  would certainly have touched you on account of the discourse  which you entered into.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.15</b>]
<br>
<br> When you received it with your tongues and spoke with  your mouths what you had no knowledge of,
<br> and you deemed it  an easy matter while with Allah it was grievous.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And why did you not,
<br> when you heard it,
<br> say:
<br> It does not  beseem us that we should talk of it;
<br> glory be to Thee!
<br> this  is a great calumny?
<br>
<a name = "verse24_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah admonishes you that you should not return to the  like of it ever again if you are believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah makes clear to you the communications;
<br> and  Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who love that scandal should  circulate respecting those who believe,
<br> they shall have a  grievous chastisement in this world and the hereafter;
<br> and  Allah knows,
<br> while you do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And were it not for Allah's grace on you and His mercy,
<br>  and that Allah is Compassionate,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.21</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> do not follow the footsteps of the  Shaitan,
<br> and whoever follows the footsteps of the Shaitan,
<br>  then surely he bids the doing of indecency and evil;
<br> and  were it not for Allah's grace upon you and His mercy,
<br> not  one of you would have ever been pure,
<br> but Allah purifies  whom He pleases;
<br> and Allah is Hearing,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And let not those of you who possess grace and abundance  swear against giving to the near of kin and the poor and  those who have fled in Allah's way,
<br> and they should pardon  and turn away.
<br> Do you not love that Allah should forgive  you?
<br> And Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who accuse chaste believing women,
<br> unaware  (of the evil),
<br> are cursed in this world and the hereafter,
<br>  and they shall have a grievous chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.24</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when their tongues and their hands and their  feet shall bear witness against them as to what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.25</b>]
<br>
<br> On that day Allah will pay back to them in full their  just reward,
<br> and they shall know that Allah is the evident  Truth.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Bad women .
<br>are for bad men and bad men are for bad  women.
 Good women are for good men and good men are for good  women<br>
<a name = "verse24_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.27</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> Do not enter houses other than your  own houses until you have asked permission and saluted their  inmates;
<br> this is better for you,
<br> that you may be mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.28</b>]
<br>
<br> But if you do not find any one therein,
<br> then do not  enter them until permission is given to you;
<br> and if it is  said to you:
<br> Go back,
<br> then go back;
<br> this is purer for you;
<br>  and Allah is Cognizant of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.29</b>]
<br>
<br> It is no sin in you that you enter uninhabited houses  wherein you have your necessaries;
<br> and Allah knows what you  do openly and what you hide.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Say to the believing men that they cast down their looks  and guard their private parts;
<br> that is purer for them;
<br>  surely Allah is Aware of what they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And say to the believing women that they cast down their  looks and guard their private parts and do not display their  ornaments except what appears thereof,
<br> and let them wear  their head-coverings over their bosoms,
<br> and not display  their ornaments except to their husbands or their fathers,
<br>  or the fathers of their husbands,
<br> or their sons,
<br> or the sons  of their husbands,
<br> or their brothers,
<br> or their brothers'  sons,
<br> or their sisters' sons,
<br> or their women,
<br> or those whom  their right hands possess,
<br> or the male servants not having  need (of women),
<br> or the children who have not attained  knowledge of what is hidden of women;
<br> and let them not  strike their feet so that what they hide of their ornaments  may be known;
<br> and turn to Allah all of you,
<br> O believers!
<br> so  that you may be successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And marry those among you who are single and those who  are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves;
<br> if  they are needy,
<br> Allah will make them free from want out of  His grace;
<br> and Allah is Ample-giving,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And let those who do not find the means to marry keep  chaste until Allah makes them free from want out of His  grace.
<br> And (as for) those who ask for a writing from among  those whom your right hands possess,
<br> give them the writing  if you know any good in them,
<br> and give them of the wealth of  Allah which He has given you;
<br> and do not compel your slave  girls to prostitution,
<br> when they desire to keep chaste,
<br> in  order to seek the frail good of this world's life;
<br> and  whoever compels them,
<br> then surely after their compulsion  Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have sent to you clear communications  and a description of those who have passed away before you,
<br>  and an admonition to those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse24_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth;
<br> a  likeness of His light is as a niche in which is a lamp,
<br> the  lamp is in a glass,
<br> (and) the glass is as it were a brightly  shining star,
<br> lit from a blessed olive-tree,
<br> neither eastern  nor western,
<br> the oil whereof almost gives light though fire  touch it not-- light upon light-- Allah guides to His light  whom He pleases,
<br> and Allah sets forth parables for men,
<br> and  Allah is Cognizant of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.36</b>]
<br>
<br> In houses which Allah has permitted to be exalted and  that His name may be remembered in them;
<br> there glorify Him  therein in the mornings and the evenings,
<br>
<a name = "verse24_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Men whom neither merchandise nor selling diverts from  the remembrance of Allah and the keeping up of prayer and  the giving of poor-rate;
<br> they fear a day in which the hearts  and eyes shall turn about;
<br>
<a name = "verse24_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.38</b>]
<br>
<br> That Allah may give them the best reward of what they  have done,
<br> and give them more out of His grace;
<br> and Allah  gives sustenance to whom He pleases without measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who disbelieve,
<br> their deeds are like  the mirage in a desert,
<br> which the thirsty man deems to be  water;
<br> until when he comes to it he finds it to be naught,
<br>  and there he finds Allah,
<br> so He pays back to him his  reckoning in full;
<br> and Allah is quick in reckoning;
<br>
<a name = "verse24_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Or like utter darkness in the deep sea:
<br> there covers it  a wave above which is another wave,
<br> above which is a cloud,
<br>  (layers of) utter darkness one above another;
<br> when he holds  out his hand,
<br> he is almost unable to see it;
<br> and to  whomsoever Allah does not give light,
<br> he has no light.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah is He Whom do glorify all  those who are in the heavens and the earth,
<br> and the (very)  birds with expanded wings?
<br> He knows the prayer of each one  and its glorification,
<br> and Allah is Cognizant of what they  do.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth,
<br>  and to Allah is the eventual coming.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah drives along the clouds,
<br> then  gathers them together,
<br> then piles them up,
<br> so that you see  the rain coming forth from their midst?
<br> And He sends down of  the clouds that are (like) mountains wherein is hail,
<br>  afflicting therewith whom He pleases and turning it away  from whom He pleases;
<br> the flash of His lightning almost  takes away the sight.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah turns over the night and the day;
<br> most surely  there is a lesson in this for those who have sight.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah has created from water every living creature:
<br>  so of them is that which walks upon its belly,
<br> and of them  is that which walks upon two feet,
<br> and of them is that which  walks upon four;
<br> Allah creates what He pleases;
<br> surely Allah  has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly We have revealed clear communications,
<br> and  Allah guides whom He pleases to the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> We believe in Allah and in the apostle and  we obey;
<br> then a party of them turn back after this,
<br> and  these are not believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they are called to Allah and His Apostle that  he may judge between them,
<br> lo!
<br> a party of them turn aside.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And if the truth be on their side,
<br> they come to him  quickly,
<br> obedient.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Is there in their hearts a disease,
<br> or are they in  doubt,
<br> or do they fear that Allah and His Apostle will act  wrongfully towards them?
<br> Nay!
<br> they themselves are the  unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.51</b>]
<br>
<br> The response of the believers,
<br> when they are invited to  Allah and His Apostle that he may judge between them,
<br> is  only to say:
<br> We hear and we obey;
<br> and these it is that are  the successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And he who obeys Allah and His Apostle,
<br> and fears Allah,
<br>  and is careful of (his duty to) Him,
<br> these it is that are  the achievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And they swear by Allah with the most energetic of their  oaths that if you command them they would certainly go  forth.
<br> Say:
<br> Swear not;
<br> reasonable obedience (is desired);
<br>  surely Allah is aware of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Obey Allah and obey the Apostle;
<br> but if you turn  back,
<br> then on him rests that which is imposed on him and on  you rests that which is imposed on you;
<br> and if you obey him,
<br>  you are on the right way;
<br> and nothing rests on the Apostle  but clear delivering (of the message).
<br>
<a name = "verse24_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do  good that He will most certainly make them rulers in the  earth as He made rulers those before them,
<br> and that He will  most certainly establish for them their religion which He  has chosen for them,
<br> and that He will most certainly,
<br> after  their fear,
<br> give them security in exchange;
<br> they shall serve  Me,
<br> not associating aught with Me;
<br> and whoever is ungrateful  after this,
<br> these it is who are the.
<br> transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate and obey the  Apostle,
<br> so that mercy may be shown to you.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Think not that those who disbelieve shall escape in the  earth,
<br> and their abode is the fire;
<br> and certainly evil is  the resort!
<br>
<a name = "verse24_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.58</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> let those whom your right hands  possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty  ask permission of you three times;
<br> before the morning  prayer,
<br> and when you put off your clothes at midday in  summer,
<br> and after the prayer of the nightfall;
<br> these are  three times of privacy for you;
<br> neither is it a sin for you  nor for them besides these,
<br> some of you must go round about  (waiting) upon others;
<br> thus does Allah make clear to you the  communications,
<br> and Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the children among you have attained to  puberty,
<br> let them seek permission as those before them  sought permission;
<br> thus does Allah make clear to you His  communications,
<br> and Allah is knowing,
<br> Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) women advanced in years who do not hope for  a marriage,
<br> it is no sin for them if they put off their  clothes without displaying their ornaments;
<br> and if they  restrain themselves it is better for them;
<br> and Allah is  Hearing,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.61</b>]
<br>
<br> There is no blame on the blind man,
<br> nor is there blame  on the lame,
<br> nor is there blame on the sick,
<br> nor on  yourselves that you eat from your houses,
<br> or your fathers'  houses or your mothers' houses,
<br> or your brothers' houses,
<br> or  your sisters' houses,
<br> or your paternal uncles' houses,
<br> or  your paternal aunts' houses,
<br> or your maternal uncles'  houses,
<br> or your maternal aunts' houses,
<br> or what you possess  the keys of,
<br> or your friends' (houses).
<br> It is no sin in you  that you eat together or separately.
<br> So when you enter  houses,
<br> greet your people with a salutation from Allah,
<br>  blessed (and) goodly;
<br> thus does Allah make clear to you the  communications that you may understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.62</b>]
<br>
<br> Only those are believers who believe in Allah and His  Apostle,
<br> and when they are with him on a momentous affair  they go not away until they have asked his permission;
<br>  surely they who ask your permission are they who believe in  Allah and His Apostle;
<br> so when they ask your permission for  some affair of theirs,
<br> give permission to whom you please of  them and ask forgiveness for them from Allah;
<br> surely Allah  is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Do not hold the Apostle's calling (you) among you to be  like your calling one to the other;
<br> Allah indeed knows those  who steal away from among you,
<br> concealing themselves;
<br>  therefore let those beware who go against his order lest a  trial afflict them or there befall them a painful  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse24_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>24.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Now surely Allah's is whatever is in the heavens and the  earth;
<br> He knows indeed that to which you are conforming  yourselves;
<br> and on the day on which they are returned to Him  He will inform them of what they did;
<br> and Allah is Cognizant  of all things.
