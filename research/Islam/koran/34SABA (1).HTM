<p><h3>Book 34</h3>
<br><h3>The Saba</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse34_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.1</b>]
<br>
<br> (All) praise is due to Allah,
<br> Whose is what is in the  heavens and what is in the earth,
<br> and to Him is due (all)  praise in the hereafter;
<br> and He is the Wise,
<br> the Aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.2</b>]
<br>
<br> He knows that which goes down into the earth and that  which comes out of it,
<br> and that which comes down from the  heaven and that which goes up to it;
<br> and He is the Merciful,
<br>  the Forgiving.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> The hour shall not come  upon us.
<br> Say:
<br> Yea!
<br> by my Lord,
<br> the Knower of the unseen,
<br> it  shall certainly come upon you;
<br> not the weight of an atom  becomes absent from Him,
<br> in the heavens or in the earth,
<br> and  neither less than that nor greater,
 but (all) is in a clear  book<br>
<a name = "verse34_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.4</b>]
<br>
<br> That He may reward those who believe and do good;
<br> these  it is for whom is forgiveness and an honorable sustenance.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who strive hard in opposing Our  communications,
<br> these it is for whom is a painful  chastisement of an evil kind.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And those to whom the knowledge has been given see that  which has been revealed to you from your Lord,
<br> that is the  truth,
<br> and it guides into the path of the Mighty,
<br> the  Praised.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> Shall we point out to you a  man who informs you that when you are scattered the utmost  scattering you shall then be most surely (raised) in (to) a  new creation?
<br>
<a name = "verse34_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.8</b>]
<br>
<br> He has forged a lie against Allah or there is madness in  him.
<br> Nay!
<br> those who do not believe in the hereafter are in  torment and in great error.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not then consider what is before them and what is  behind them of the heaven and the earth?
<br> If We please We  will make them disappear in the land or bring down upon them  a portion from the heaven;
<br> most surely there is a sign in  this for every servant turning (to Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse34_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave to Dawood excellence from Us:
<br> O  mountains!
<br> sing praises with him,
<br> and the birds;
<br> and We made  the iron pliant to him,
<br>
<a name = "verse34_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Saying:
<br> Make ample (coats of mail),
<br> and assign a time to  the making of coats of mail and do good;
<br> surely I am Seeing  what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And (We made) the wind (subservient) to Sulaiman,
<br> which  made a month's journey in the morning and a month's journey  m the evening,
<br> and We made a fountain of molten copper to  flow out for him,
<br> and of the jinn there were those who  worked before him by the command of his Lord;
<br> and whoever  turned aside from Our command from among them,
<br> We made him  taste of the punishment of burning.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.13</b>]
<br>
<br> They made for him what he pleased of fortresses and  images,
<br> and bowls (large) as watering-troughs and  cooking-pots that will not move from their place;
<br> give  thanks,
<br> O family of Dawood!
<br> and very few of My servants are  grateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.14</b>]
<br>
<br> But when We decreed death for him,
<br> naught showed them  his death but a creature of the earth that ate away his  staff;
<br> and when it fell down,
<br> the jinn came to know plainly  that if they had known the unseen,
<br> they would not have  tarried in abasing torment.
<br>    15 Certainly there was a sign for Saba in their abode;
<br> two  gardens on the right and the left;
<br> eat of the sustenance of  your Lord and give thanks to Him:
<br> a good land and a  Forgiving Lord!
<br>    16 But they turned aside,
<br> so We sent upon them a torrent of  which the rush could not be withstood,
<br> and in place of their  two gardens We gave to them two gardens yielding bitter  fruit and (growing) tamarisk and a few lote-trees.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.17</b>]
<br>
<br> This We requited them with because they disbelieved;
<br> and  We do not punish any but the ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made between them and the towns which We had  blessed (other) towns to be easily seen,
<br> and We apportioned  the journey therein:
<br> Travel through them nights and days,
<br>  secure.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And they said:
<br> O our Lord!
<br> make spaces to be longer  between our journeys;
<br> and they were unjust to themselves so  We made them stories and scattered them with an utter  scattering;
<br> most surely there are signs in this for every  patient,
 grateful one<br>
<a name = "verse34_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly the Shaitan found true his conjecture  concerning them,
<br> so they follow him,
<br> except a party of the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And he has no authority over them,
<br> but that We may  distinguish him who believes in the hereafter from him who  is in doubt concerning it;
 and your Lord is the Preserver of  all things<br>
<a name = "verse34_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Call upon those whom you assert besides Allah;
<br> they  do not control the weight of an atom in the heavens or in  the earth nor have they any partnership in either,
<br> nor has  He among them any one to back (Him) up.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And intercession will not avail aught with Him save of  him whom He permits.
<br> Until when fear shall be removed from  their hearts,
<br> They shall say:
<br> What is it that your Lord  said?
<br> They shall say:
<br> The truth.
<br> And He is the Most High,
<br>  the Great.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Who gives you the sustenance from the heavens and  the earth?
<br> Say:
<br> Allah.
 And most surely we or you are on a  right way or in manifest error<br>
<a name = "verse34_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> You will not be questioned as to what we are guilty  of,
<br> nor shall we be questioned as to what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Our Lord will gather us together,
<br> then will He  judge between us with the truth;
<br> and He is the greatest  Judge,
<br> the All-knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Show me those whom you have joined with Him as  associates;
<br> by no means (can you do it).
<br> Nay!
<br> He is Allah,
<br>  the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have not sent you but to all the men as a bearer  of good news and as a warner,
<br> but most men do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> When will this promise be (fulfilled) if  you are truthful?
<br>
<a name = "verse34_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> You have the appointment of a day from which you  cannot hold back any while,
<br> nor can you bring it on.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> By no means will we  believe in this Quran,
<br> nor in that which is before it;
<br> and  could you see when the unjust shall be made to stand before  their Lord,
<br> bandying words one with another!
<br> Those who were  reckoned weak shall say to those who were proud:
<br> Had it not  been for you we would certainly have been believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who were proud shall say to those who were deemed  weak:
<br> Did we turn you away from the guidance after it had  come to you?
<br> Nay,
<br> you (yourselves) were guilty 33.
<br> And those  who were deemed weak shall say to those who were proud.
<br> Nay,
<br>  (it was) planning by night and day when you told us to  disbelieve in Allah and to set up likes with Him.
<br> And they  shall conceal regret when they shall see the punishment;
<br> and  We will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved;
<br>  they shall not be requited but what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And We never sent a warner to a town but those who led  lives in ease in it said:
<br> We are surely disbelievers in what  you are sent with.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> We have more wealth and children,
<br> and we  shall not be punished.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence  for whom He pleases and straitens (for whom He pleases),
<br> but  most men do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And not your wealth nor your children,
<br> are the things  which bring you near Us in station,
<br> but whoever believes and  does good,
<br> these it is for whom is a double reward for what  they do,
<br> and they shall be secure in the highest places.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who strive in opposing Our  communications,
<br> they shall be caused to be brought to the  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Surely my Lord amplifies the means of subsistence  for whom He pleases of His servants and straitens (them) for  whom    (He pleases),
<br> and whatever thing you spend,
<br> He exceeds It m  reward,
<br> and He is the best of Sustainers.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when He will gather them all together,
<br>  then will He say to the angels:
<br> Did these worship you?
<br>
<a name = "verse34_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.41</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> Glory be to Thee!
<br> Thou art our Guardian,
<br>  not they;
<br> nay!
<br> they worshipped the jinn;
<br> most of them were  believers in them.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.42</b>]
<br>
<br> So on that day one of you shall not control profit or  harm for another,
<br> and We will say to those who were unjust:
<br>  Taste the chastisement of the fire which you called a lie.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our clear communications are recited to them,
<br>  they say:
<br> This is naught but a man who desires to turn you  away from that which your fathers worshipped.
<br> And they say:
<br>  This is naught but a lie that is forged.
<br> And those who  disbelieve say of the truth when it comes to them:
<br> This is  only clear enchantment.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have not given them any books which they read,
<br>  nor did We send to them before you a warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And those before them rejected (the truth),
<br> and these  have not yet attained a tenth of what We gave them,
<br> but they  gave the lie to My apostles,
<br> then how was the manifestation  of My disapproval?
<br>
<a name = "verse34_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I exhort you only to one thing,
<br> that rise up for  Allah's sake in twos and singly,
<br> then ponder:
<br> there is no  madness in your fellow-citizen;
<br> he is only a warner to you  before a severe chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Whatever reward I have asked of you,
<br> that is only  for yourselves;
<br> my reward is only with Allah,
<br> and He is a  witness of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Surely my Lord utters the truth,
<br> the great Knower  of the unseen.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> The truth has come,
<br> and the falsehood shall vanish  and shall not come back.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If I err,
<br> I err only against my own soul,
<br> and if I  follow a right direction,
<br> it ?
<br>s because of what my Lord  reveals to me;
<br> surely He is Hearing,
<br> Nigh.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And could you see when they shall become terrified,
 but  (then) there shall be no escape and they shall be seized  upon from a near place<br>
<a name = "verse34_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall say:
<br> We believe in it.
<br> And how shall the  attaining (of faith) be possible to them from a distant  place?
<br>
<a name = "verse34_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And they disbelieved in it before,
<br> and they utter  conjectures with regard to the unseen from a distant place.
<br>
<a name = "verse34_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>34.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And a barrier shall be placed between them and that  which they desire,
<br> as was done with the likes of them  before:
<br> surely they are in a disquieting doubt.
