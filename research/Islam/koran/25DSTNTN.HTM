<p><h3>Book 25</h3>
<br><h3>The Distinction</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse25_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Blessed is He Who sent down the Furqan upon His servant  that he may be a warner to the nations;
<br>
<a name = "verse25_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.2</b>]
<br>
<br> He,
<br> Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth,
<br>  and Who did not take to Himself a son,
<br> and Who has no  associate in the kingdom,
<br> and Who created everything,
<br> then  ordained for it a measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And they have taken besides Him gods,
<br> who do not create  anything while they are themselves created,
<br> and they control  not for themselves any harm or profit,
<br> and they control not  death nor life,
<br> nor raising (the dead) to life.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> This is nothing but a lie  which he has forged,
<br> and other people have helped him at it;
<br>  so indeed they have done injustice and (uttered) a  falsehood.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> The stories of the ancients-- he has got them  written-- so these are read out to him morning and evening.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> He has revealed it Who knows the secret in the  heavens and the earth;
<br> surely He is ever Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> What is the matter with this Apostle that  he eats food and goes about in the markets;
<br> why has not an  angel been sent down to him,
<br> so that he should have been a  warner with him?
<br>
<a name = "verse25_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Or (why is not) a treasure sent down to him,
<br> or he is  made to have a garden from which he should eat?
<br> And the  unjust say:
<br> You do not follow any but a man deprived of  reason.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.9</b>]
<br>
<br> See what likenesses do they apply to you,
<br> so they have  gone astray,
<br> therefore they shall not be able to find a way.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Blessed is He Who,
<br> if He please,
<br> will give you what is  better than this,
<br> gardens beneath which rivers flow,
<br> and He  will give you palaces.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.11</b>]
<br>
<br> But they reject the hour,
<br> and We have prepared a burning  fire for him who rejects the hour.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.12</b>]
<br>
<br> When it shall come into their sight from a distant  place,
<br> they shall hear its vehement raging and roaring.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they are cast into a narrow place in it,
<br> bound,
<br>  they shall there call out for destruction.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Call not this day for one destruction,
<br> but call for  destructions many.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Is this better or the abiding garden which those  who guard (against evil) are promised?
<br> That shall be a  reward and a resort for them.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.16</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall have therein what they desire abiding (in  it);
<br> it is a promise which it is proper to be prayed for  from your Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when He shall gather them,
<br> and whatever  they served besides Allah,
<br> He shall say:
<br> Was it you who led  astray these My servants,
<br> or did they themselves go astray  from the path?
<br>
<a name = "verse25_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.18</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> Glory be to Thee;
<br> it was not beseeming  for us that we should take any guardians besides Thee,
<br> but  Thou didst make them and their fathers to enjoy until they  forsook the reminder,
<br> and they were a people in perdition,
<br>
<a name = "verse25_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.19</b>]
<br>
<br> So they shall indeed give you the lie in what you say,
<br>  then you shall not be able to ward off or help,
<br> and whoever  among you is unjust,
<br> We will make him taste a great  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have not sent before you any messengers but they  most surely ate food and went about in the markets;
<br> and We  have made some of you a trial for others;
<br> will you bear  patiently?
<br> And your Lord is ever Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who do not hope for Our meeting,
<br> say:
<br> Why have  not angels been sent down upon us,
<br> or (why) do we not see  our Lord?
<br> Now certainly they are too proud of themselves and  have revolted in great revolt.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.22</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when they shall see the angels,
<br> there shall  be no joy on that day for the guilty,
<br> and they shall say:
<br> It  is a forbidden thing totally prohibited.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And We will proceed to what they have done of deeds,
<br> so  We shall render them as scattered floating dust.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.24</b>]
<br>
<br> The dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in a  better abiding-place and a better resting-place.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when the heaven shall burst asunder with  the clouds,
<br> and the angels shall be sent down descending (in  ranks).
<br>
<a name = "verse25_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.26</b>]
<br>
<br> The kingdom on that day shall rightly belong to the  Beneficent God,
<br> and a hard day shall it be for the  unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And the day when the unjust one shall bite his hands  saying:
<br> O!
 would that I had taken a way with the Apostle<br>
<a name = "verse25_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.28</b>]
<br>
<br> O woe is me!
<br> would that I had not taken such a one for a  friend !
<br>
<a name = "verse25_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly he led me astray from the reminder after it  had come to me;
<br> and the Shaitan fails to aid man.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And the Apostle cried out:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> surely my people  have treated this Quran as a forsaken thing.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy from  among the sinners and sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and  a Helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say:
<br> Why has not the Quran been  revealed to him all at once?
<br> Thus,
<br> that We may strengthen  your heart by it and We have arranged it well in arranging.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall not bring to you any argument,
<br> but We  have brought to you (one) with truth and best in  significance.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.34</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who shall be gathered upon their faces to  hell,
<br> they are in a worse plight and straying farther away  from the path.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave Musa the Book and We appointed  with him his brother Haroun an aider.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We said:
<br> Go you both to the people who rejected Our  communications;
<br> so We destroyed them with utter destruction.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And the people of Nuh,
<br> when they rejected the apostles,
<br>  We drowned them,
<br> and made them a sign for men,
<br> and We have  prepared a painful punishment for the unjust;
<br>
<a name = "verse25_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And Ad and Samood and the dwellers of the Rass and many  generations between them.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And to every one We gave examples and every one did We  destroy with utter destruction.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly they have (often) passed by the town on  which was rained an evil rain;
<br> did they not then see it?
<br>  Nay!
<br> they did not hope to be raised again.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they see you,
<br> they do not take you for aught  but a mockery:
<br> Is this he whom Allah has raised to be an  apostle?
<br>
<a name = "verse25_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.42</b>]
<br>
<br> He had well-nigh led us astray from our gods had we not  adhered to them patiently!
<br> And they will know,
<br> when they see  the punishment,
<br> who is straying farther off from the path.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you seen him who takes his low desires for his god?
<br>  Will you then be a protector over him?
<br>
<a name = "verse25_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do you think that most of them do hear or understand?
<br>  They are nothing but as cattle;
<br> nay,
<br> they are straying  farther off from the path.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not considered (the work of) your Lord,
<br> how He  extends the shade?
<br> And if He had pleased He would certainly  have made it stationary;
<br> then We have made the sun an  indication of it    46 Then We take it to Ourselves,
<br> taking little by little.
<br>    47 And He it is Who made the night a covering for you,
<br> and  the sleep a rest,
<br> and He made the day to rise up again.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who sends the winds as good news before His  mercy;
<br> and We send down pure water from the cloud,
<br>
<a name = "verse25_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.49</b>]
<br>
<br> That We may give life thereby to a dead land and give it  for drink,
<br> out of what We have created,
<br> to cattle and many  people.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have repeated this to them that they  may be mindful,
<br> but the greater number of men do not consent  to aught except denying.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We had pleased We would certainly have raised a  warner in every town.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.52</b>]
<br>
<br> So do not follow the unbelievers,
<br> and strive against  them a mighty striving with it.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who has made two seas to flow freely,
<br> the  one sweet that subdues thirst by its sweetness,
<br> and the  other salt that burns by its saltness;
<br> and between the two  He has made a barrier and inviolable obstruction.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who has created man from the water,
<br> then He  has made for him blood relationship and marriage  relationship,
<br> and your Lord is powerful.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And they serve besides Allah that which neither profits  them nor causes them harm;
<br> and the unbeliever is a partisan  against his Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have not sent you but as a giver of good news and  as a warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I do not ask you aught in return except that he who  will,
<br> may take the way to his Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And rely on the Ever-living Who dies not,
<br> and celebrate  His praise;
<br> and Sufficient is He as being aware of the  faults of His servants,
<br>
<a name = "verse25_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Who created the heavens and the earth and what is  between them in six periods,
<br> and He is firmly established on  the throne of authority;
<br> the Beneficent God,
<br> so ask  respecting it one aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it is said to them:
<br> Make obeisance to the  Beneficent God,
<br> they say:
<br> And what is the God of  beneficence?
<br> Shall we make obeisance to what you bid us?
<br> And  it adds to their aversion.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.61</b>]
<br>
<br> Blessed is He Who made the constellations in the heavens  and made therein a lamp and a shining moon.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.62</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who made the night and the day to follow  each other for him who desires to be mindful or desires to  be thankful.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.63</b>]
<br>
<br> And the servants of the Beneficent God are they who walk  on the earth in humbleness,
<br> and when the ignorant address  them,
<br> they say:
<br> Peace.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.64</b>]
<br>
<br> And they who pass the night prostrating themselves  before their Lord and standing.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And they who say:
<br> O our Lord!
<br> turn away from us the  punishment of hell,
 surely the punishment thereof is a  lasting<br>
<a name = "verse25_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely it is an evil abode and (evil) place to stay.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And they who when they spend,
<br> are neither extravagant  nor parsimonious,
<br> and (keep) between these the just mean.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.68</b>]
<br>
<br> And they who do not call upon another god with Allah and  do not slay the soul,
<br> which Allah has forbidden except in  the requirements of justice,
<br> and (who) do not commit  fornication and he who does this shall find a requital of  sin;
<br>
<a name = "verse25_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.69</b>]
<br>
<br> The punishment shall be doubled to him on the day of  resurrection,
<br> and he shall abide therein in abasement;
<br>
<a name = "verse25_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.70</b>]
<br>
<br> Except him who repents and believes and does a good  deed;
<br> so these are they of whom Allah changes the evil deeds  to good ones;
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.71</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever repents and does good,
<br> he surely turns to  Allah a (goodly) turning.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And they who do not bear witness to what is false,
<br> and  when they pass by what is vain,
<br> they pass by nobly.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And they who,
<br> when reminded of the communications of  their Lord,
<br> do not fall down thereat deaf and blind.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And they who say:
<br> O our Lord!
<br> grant us in our wives and  our offspring the joy of our eyes,
<br> and make us guides to  those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse25_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.75</b>]
<br>
<br> These shall be rewarded with high places because they  were patient,
<br> and shall be met therein with greetings and  salutations.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.76</b>]
<br>
<br> Abiding therein;
<br> goodly the abode and the resting-place.
<br>
<a name = "verse25_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>25.77</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> My Lord would not care for you were it not for your  prayer;
<br> but you have indeed rejected (the truth),
<br> so that  which shall cleave shall come.
