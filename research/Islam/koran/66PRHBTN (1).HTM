<p><h3>Book 66</h3>
<br><h3>The Prohibition</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
      </p>
<a name = "verse66_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> why do you forbid (yourself) that which Allah  has made lawful for you;
<br> you seek to please your wives;
<br> and  Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah indeed has sanctioned for you the expiation of your  oaths and Allah is your Protector,
<br> and He is the Knowing the  Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the prophet secretly communicated a piece of  information to one of his wives-- but when she informed  (others) of it,
<br> and Allah made him to know it,
<br> he made known  part of it and avoided part;
<br> so when he informed her of it,
<br>  she said:
<br> Who informed you of this?
<br> He said:
<br> The Knowing,
<br>  the one Aware,
<br> informed me.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.4</b>]
<br>
<br> If you both turn to Allah,
<br> then indeed your hearts are  already inclined (to this);
<br> and if you back up each other  against him,
<br> then surely Allah it is Who is his Guardian,
<br>  and Jibreel and -the believers that do good,
<br> and the angels  after that are the aiders.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Maybe,
<br> his Lord,
<br> if he divorce you,
<br> will give him in your  place wives better than you,
<br> submissive,
<br> faithful,
<br> obedient,
<br>  penitent,
<br> adorers,
<br> fasters,
<br> widows and virgins.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.6</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> save yourselves and your families from  a fire whose fuel is men and stones;
<br> over it are angels  stern and strong,
<br> they do not disobey Allah in what He  commands them,
<br> and do as they are commanded.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.7</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who disbelieve!
<br> do not urge excuses today;
<br> you  shall be rewarded only according to what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.8</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> turn to Allah a sincere turning;
<br> maybe  your Lord will remove from you your evil and cause you to  enter gardens beneath which rivers flow,
<br> on the day on which  Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who believe with  him;
<br> their light shall run on before them and on their right  hands;
<br> they shall say:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> make perfect for us our  light,
<br> and grant us protection,
<br> surely Thou hast power over  all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.9</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> strive hard against the unbelievers and the  hypocrites,
<br> and be hard against them;
<br> and their abode is  hell;
<br> and evil is the resort.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah sets forth an example to those who disbelieve the  wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut:
<br> they were both under two of  Our righteous servants,
<br> but they acted treacherously towards  them so they availed them naught against Allah,
<br> and it was  said:
<br> Enter both the fire with those who enter.
<br>
<a name = "verse66_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah sets forth an example to those who believe the  wife of Firon when she said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> build for me a house  with Thee in the garden and deliver me from Firon and his  doing,
<br> and deliver me from the unjust people:
<br>
<a name = "verse66_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>66.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And Marium,
<br> the daughter of Imran,
<br> who guarded her  chastity,
<br> so We breathed into her of Our inspiration and she  accepted the truth of the words of her Lord and His books,
<br>  and she was of,
<br> the obedient ones.
