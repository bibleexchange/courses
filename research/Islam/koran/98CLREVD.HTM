<p><h3>Book 98</h3>
<br><h3>The Clear Evidence</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse98_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>98.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who disbelieved from among the followers of the  Book and the polytheists could not have separated (from the  faithful) until there had come to them the clear evidence:
<br>
<a name = "verse98_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>98.2</b>]
<br>
<br> An apostle from Allah,
<br> reciting pure pages,
<br>
<a name = "verse98_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>98.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Wherein are all the right ordinances.
<br>
<a name = "verse98_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>98.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who were given the Book did not become divided  except after clear evidence had come to them.
<br>
<a name = "verse98_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>98.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And they were not enjoined anything except that they  should serve Allah,
<br> being sincere to Him in obedience,
<br>  upright,
<br> and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate,
<br> and that  is the right religion.
<br>
<a name = "verse98_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>98.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who disbelieve from among the followers of  the Book and the polytheists shall be in the fire of hell,
<br>  abiding therein;
<br> they are the worst of men.
<br>
<a name = "verse98_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>98.7</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who believe and do good,
<br> surely they are  the -best of men.
<br>
<a name = "verse98_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>98.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Their reward with their Lord is gardens of perpetuity  beneath which rivers flow,
<br> abiding therein for ever;
<br> Allah  is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with  Him;
<br> that is for him who fears his Lord.
