<p><h3>Book 67</h3>
<br><h3>The Kingdom</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
      </p>
<a name = "verse67_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom,
<br> and He has  power over all things,
<br>
<a name = "verse67_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Who created death and life that He may try you-- which of  you is best in deeds;
<br> and He is the Mighty,
<br> the Forgiving,
<br>
<a name = "verse67_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Who created the seven heavens one above another;
<br> you see  no incongruity in the creation of the Beneficent God;
<br> then  look again,
<br> can you see any disorder?
<br>
<a name = "verse67_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Then turn back the eye again and again;
<br> your look shall  ' come back to you confused while it is fatigued.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have adorned this lower heaven with (  lamps and We have made these missiles for the Shaitans,
<br> and  We have prepared for them the chastisement of burning.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the  punishment of hell,
<br> and evil is the resort.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.7</b>]
<br>
<br> When they shall be cast therein,
<br> they shall hear a loud  moaning of it as it heaves,
<br>
<a name = "verse67_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Almost bursting for fury.
<br> Whenever a group is cast into  it,
<br> its keeper shall ask them:
<br> Did there not come to you a  warner?
<br>
<a name = "verse67_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.9</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> Yea!
<br> indeed there came to us a warner,
<br>  but we rejected (him) and said:
<br> Allah has not revealed  anything,
<br> you are only in a great error.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall say:
<br> Had we but listened or pondered,
<br> we  should not have been among the inmates of the burning fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.11</b>]
<br>
<br> So they shall acknowledge their sins,
<br> but far will be  (forgiveness) from the inmates of the burning fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.12</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who fear their Lord in secret,
<br> they shall  surely have forgiveness and a great reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And conceal your word or manifest it;
<br> surely He is  Cognizant of what is in the hearts.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Does He not know,
<br> Who created?
<br> And He is the Knower of  the subtleties,
<br> the Aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.15</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who made the earth smooth for you,
<br> therefore go  about in the spacious sides thereof,
<br> and eat of His  sustenance,
<br> and to Him is the return after death.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Are you secure of those in the heaven that He should not  make the earth to swallow you up?
<br> Then lo!
<br> it shall be in a  state of commotion.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Or are you secure of those in the heaven that He should  not send down upon you a punishment?
<br> Then shall you know how  was My warning.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly those before them rejected (the truth),
<br>  then how was My disapproval.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Have they not seen the birds above them expanding (their  wings) and contracting (them)?
<br> What is it that withholds  them save the Beneficent God?
<br> Surely He sees everything.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Or who is it that will be a host for you to assist you  besides the Beneficent God?
<br> The unbelievers are only in  deception.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Or who is it that will give you sustenance if He should  withhold His sustenance?
<br> Nay!
<br> they persist in disdain and  aversion.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.22</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> is he who goes prone upon his face better guided  or he who walks upright upon a straight path?
<br>
<a name = "verse67_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> He it is Who brought you into being and made for  you the ears and the eyes and the hearts:
<br> little is it that  you give thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him  you shall be gathered.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> When shall this threat be (executed) if  you are truthful?
<br>
<a name = "verse67_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> The knowledge (thereof is only with Allah and I am  only a plain warner.
=<br>
<a name = "verse67_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.27</b>]
<br>
<br> But when they shall see it nigh,
<br> the faces of those who  disbelieve shall be sorry,
<br> and it shall be said;
<br> This is  that which you used to call for.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Have you considered if Allah should destroy me and  those with me-- rather He will have mercy on us;
<br> yet who will  protect the unbelievers from a painful punishment?
<br>
<a name = "verse67_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> He is the Beneficent God,
<br> we believe in Him and on  Him do we rely,
<br> so you shall come to know who it is that is  in clear error.
<br>
<a name = "verse67_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>67.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Have you considered if your water should go down,
<br>  who is it then that will bring you flowing water?
