<p><h3>Book 83</h3>
<br><h3>The Deceivers in Measuring</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse83_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe to the defrauders,
<br>
<a name = "verse83_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Who,
<br> when they take the measure (of their dues) from men  take it fully,
<br>
<a name = "verse83_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.3</b>]
<br>
<br> But when they measure out to others or weigh out for  them,
<br> they are deficient.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.4</b>]
<br>
 Do not these think that they shall be raised again  <br>
<a name = "verse83_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  For a mighty day,
<br>
<a name = "verse83_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.6</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which men shall stand before the Lord of the  worlds?
<br>
<a name = "verse83_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> most surely the record of the wicked is in the  Sijjin.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And what will make you know what the Sijjin is?
<br>
<a name = "verse83_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.9</b>]
<br>
<br> It is a written book.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe on that day to the rejecters,
<br>
<a name = "verse83_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Who give the lie to the day of judgment.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And none gives the lie to it but every exceeder of  limits,
 sinful one<br>
<a name = "verse83_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.13</b>]
<br>
<br> When Our communications are recited to him,
<br> he says:
<br>  Stories of those of yore.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> rather,
<br> what they used to do has become like rust .
<br>  upon their hearts.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> most surely they shall on that day be debarred from  their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Then most surely they shall enter the burning fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Then shall it be said:
<br> This is what you gave the lie to.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> Most surely the record of the righteous shall be in  the Iliyin.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And what will make you know what the highest Iliyin is?
<br>
<a name = "verse83_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.20</b>]
<br>
<br> It is a written book,
<br>
<a name = "verse83_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who are drawn near (to Allah) shall witness it.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely the righteous shall be in bliss,
<br>
<a name = "verse83_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.23</b>]
<br>
<br> On thrones,
<br> they shall gaze;
<br>
<a name = "verse83_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.24</b>]
<br>
<br> You will recognize in their faces the brightness of  bliss.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.25</b>]
<br>
<br> They are made to quaff of a pure drink that is sealed  (to others).
<br>
<a name = "verse83_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.26</b>]
<br>
<br> The sealing of it is (with) musk;
<br> and for that let the  aspirers aspire.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And the admixture of it is a water of Tasnim,
<br>
<a name = "verse83_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.28</b>]
<br>
<br> A fountain from which drink they who are drawn near (to  Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse83_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who  believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they passed by them,
<br> they winked at one  another.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they returned to their own followers they  returned exulting.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they saw them,
<br> they said:
<br> Most surely these  are in error;
<br>
<a name = "verse83_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And they were not sent to be keepers over them.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.34</b>]
<br>
<br> So today those who believe shall laugh at the  unbelievers;
<br>
<a name = "verse83_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.35</b>]
<br>
<br> On thrones,
<br> they will look.
<br>
<a name = "verse83_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>83.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the disbelievers are rewarded as they did.
