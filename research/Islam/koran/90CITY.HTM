<p><h3>Book 90</h3>
<br><h3>The City</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse90_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> I swear by this city.
<br>
<a name = "verse90_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.2</b>]
<br>
 And you shall be made free from obligation in this city--<br>
<a name = "verse90_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And the begetter and whom he begot.
<br>
<a name = "verse90_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly We have created man to be in distress.
  <br>
<a name = "verse90_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Does he think that no one has power over him?
<br>
<a name = "verse90_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.6</b>]
<br>
<br> He shall say:
<br> I have wasted much wealth.
<br>
<a name = "verse90_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Does he think that no one sees him?
<br>
<a name = "verse90_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Have We not given him two eyes,
<br>
<a name = "verse90_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And a tongue and two lips,
<br>
<a name = "verse90_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And pointed out to him the two conspicuous ways?
<br>
<a name = "verse90_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.11</b>]
<br>
<br> But he would not attempt the uphill road,
<br>
<a name = "verse90_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And what will make you comprehend what the uphill road  is?
<br>
<a name = "verse90_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.13</b>]
<br>
<br> (It is) the setting free of a slave,
<br>
<a name = "verse90_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.14</b>]
<br>
 Or the giving of food in a day of hunger<br>
<a name = "verse90_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.15</b>]
<br>
<br> To an orphan,
<br> having relationship,
<br>
<a name = "verse90_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Or to the poor man lying in the dust.
<br>
<a name = "verse90_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he is of those who believe and charge one another  to show patience,
<br> and charge one another to show compassion.
<br>
<a name = "verse90_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.18</b>]
<br>
<br> These are the people of the right hand.
<br>
<a name = "verse90_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who disbelieve in our communications,
<br>  they are the people of the left hand.
<br>
<a name = "verse90_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>90.20</b>]
<br>
<br> On them is fire closed over.
