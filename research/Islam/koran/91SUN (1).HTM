<p><h3>Book 91</h3>
<br><h3>The Sun</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse91_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.1</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the sun and its brilliance,
<br>
<a name = "verse91_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And the moon when it follows the sun,
<br>
<a name = "verse91_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And the day when it shows it,
<br>
<a name = "verse91_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And the night when it draws a veil over it,
  <br>
<a name = "verse91_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  And the heaven and Him Who made it,
<br>
<a name = "verse91_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And the earth and Him Who extended it,
<br>
<a name = "verse91_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And the soul and Him Who made it perfect,
<br>
<a name = "verse91_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Then He inspired it to understand what is right and wrong  for it;
<br>
<a name = "verse91_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.9</b>]
<br>
<br> He will indeed be successful who purifies it,
<br>
<a name = "verse91_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And he will indeed fail who corrupts it.
<br>
<a name = "verse91_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Samood gave the lie (to the truth) in their inordinacy,
<br>
<a name = "verse91_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.12</b>]
<br>
<br> When the most unfortunate of them broke forth with    13 So Allah's apostle said to them (Leave alone) Allah's  she-camel,
<br> and (give) her (to) drink.
<br>
<a name = "verse91_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.14</b>]
<br>
<br> But they called him a liar and slaughtered her,
<br>  therefore their Lord crushed them for their sin and levelled  them (with the ground).
<br>
<a name = "verse91_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>91.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And He fears not its consequence.
