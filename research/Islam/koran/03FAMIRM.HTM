<p><h3>Book 3</h3>
<br><h3>The Family of Imran</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse3_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah,
<br> (there is) no god but He,
<br> the Everliving,
 the Self-subsisting  by Whom all things subsist<br>
<a name = "verse3_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.3</b>]
<br>
<br> He has revealed to you the Book with truth,
<br> verifying that  which is before it,
<br> and He revealed the Tavrat and the Injeel  aforetime,
<br> a guidance for the people,
<br> and He sent the Furqan.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they who disbelieve in the communications of Allah  they shall have a severe chastisement;
<br> and Allah is Mighty,
<br> the  Lord of retribution.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah-- surely nothing is hidden from Him in the earth or in the  heaven.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.6</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He likes;
<br> there is  no god but He,
<br> the Mighty,
 the Wise<br>
<a name = "verse3_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.7</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who has revealed the Book to you;
<br> some of its verses  are decisive,
<br> they are the basis of the Book,
<br> and others are  allegorical;
<br> then as for those in whose hearts there is  perversity they follow the part of it which is allegorical,
<br>  seeking to mislead and seeking to give it (their own)  interpretation.
<br> but none knows  its interpretation except Allah,
<br> and those who are firmly rooted  in knowledge say:
<br> We believe in it,
<br> it is all from our Lord;
<br> and  none do mind except those having understanding.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Our Lord!
<br> make not our hearts to deviate after Thou hast  guided us aright,
<br> and grant us from Thee mercy;
<br> surely Thou art  the most liberal Giver.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Our Lord!
<br> surely Thou art the Gatherer of men on a day  about which there is no doubt;
<br> surely Allah will not fail (His)  promise.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.10</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who disbelieve,
<br> surely neither their wealth  nor their children shall avail them in the least against Allah,
<br>  and  these it is who are the fuel of the fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Like the striving of the people of Firon and those before  them;
<br> they rejected Our communications,
<br> so Allah destroyed  them on account of their faults;
<br> and Allah is severe in requiting  (evil).
<br>    12:
<br> Say to those who disbelieve:
<br> You shall be vanquished,
<br> and  driven together to hell;
<br> and evil is the resting-place.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Indeed there was a sign for you in the two hosts (which)  met together in encounter;
<br> one party fighting in the way of Allah  and the other unbelieving,
<br> whom they saw twice as.
<br>many as  themselves with the sight of the eye and Allah strengthens with  His aid whom He pleases;
<br> most surely there is a lesson in this for  those who have sight.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.14</b>]
<br>
<br> The love of desires,
<br> of women and sons and hoarded  treasures of gold and silver and well bred horses and cattle and  tilth,
<br> is made to seem fair to men;
<br> this is the provision of the life  of this world;
<br> and Allah is He with Whom is the good goal (of  life).
<br>
<a name = "verse3_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br>Shall}I tell you what is better than these?
<br> For those  who guard (against evil) are gardens with their Lord,
<br> beneath  which rivers flow,
<br> to abide in them,
<br> and pure mates and Allah's  pleasure;
<br> and Allah sees the servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who say:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> surely we believe,
<br> therefore forgive  us our faults and save us from the chastisement of the  fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.17</b>]
<br>
<br> The patient,
<br> and the truthful,
<br> and the obedient,
<br> and those  who spend (benevolently) and those who ask forgiveness in the  morning times.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah bears witness that there is no god but He,
<br> and (so do)  the angels and those possessed of knowledge,
<br> maintaining His  creation with justice;
<br> there is no god but He,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the  Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the (true) religion with Allah is Islam,
<br> and those to  whom the Book had been given did not show opposition but after  knowledge had come to them,
<br> out of envy among themselves;
<br> and  whoever disbelieves in the communications of Allah then surely  Allah is quick in reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.20</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they dispute with you,
<br> say:
<br> I have submitted myself  entirely to Allah and (so) every one who follows me;
<br> and say to  those who have been given the Book and the unlearned people:
<br> Do  you submit yourselves?
<br> So if they submit then indeed they follow  the right way;
<br> and if they turn back,
<br> then upon you is only the  delivery of the message and Allah sees the servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who disbelieve in the communications of  Allah and slay the prophets unjustly and slay those among men who  enjoin justice,
<br> announce to them a painful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Those are they whose works shall become null in this world as  well as the hereafter,
<br> and they shall have no helpers.
<br>    23 Have you not considered those (Jews) who are given a portion  of the Book?
<br> They are invited to the Book of Allah that it might  decide between them,
<br> then a part of them turn back and they  withdraw.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.24</b>]
<br>
<br> This is because they say:
<br> The fire shall not touch us but for  a few days;
<br> and what they have forged deceives them in the matter  of their religion.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Then how will it be when We shall gather them together on a  day about which there is no doubt,
<br> and every soul shall be fully  paid what it has earned,
<br> and they shall not be dealt with  unjustly?
<br>
<a name = "verse3_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O Allah,
<br> Master of the Kingdom!
<br> Thou givest the kingdom  to whomsoever Thou pleasest and takest away the kingdom from  whomsoever Thou pleasest,
<br> and Thou exaltest whom Thou pleasest  and abasest whom Thou pleasest in Thine hand is the good;
<br> surety,
<br>  Thou hast power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Thou makest the night to pass into the day and Thou makest  the day to pass into the night,
<br> and Thou bringest forth the  living from the dead and Thou bringest forth the dead from the  living,
<br> and Thou givest sustenance to whom Thou pleasest without  measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends rather  than believers;
<br> and whoever does this,
<br> he shall have nothing of  (the guardianship of) Allah,
<br> but you should guard yourselves  against them,
<br> guarding carefully;
<br> and Allah makes you cautious  of (retribution from) Himself;
<br> and to Allah is the eventual  coming.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Whether you hide what is in your hearts or manifest it,
<br>  Allah knows it,
<br> and He knows whatever is in the heavens and  whatever is in the earth,
<br> and Allah has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.30</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day that every soul shall find present what it has  done of good and what it has done of evil,
<br> it shall wish that  between it and that (evil) there were a long duration of time;
<br>  and Allah makes you to be cautious of (retribution from) Himself;
<br>  and Allah is Compassionate to the servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If you love Allah,
<br> then follow me,
<br> Allah will love you  and forgive you your faults,
<br> and Allah is Forgiving,
 MercifuL<br>
<a name = "verse3_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Obey Allah and the Apostle;
<br> but if they turn back,
<br> then  surely Allah does not love the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah chose Adam and Nuh and the descendants of  Ibrahim and the descendants of Imran above the nations.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Offspring one of the other;
<br> and Allah is Hearing,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.35</b>]
<br>
<br> When a woman of Imran said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> surely I vow to Thee  what is in my womb,
<br> to be devoted (to Thy service);
<br> accept  therefore from me,
<br> surely Thou art the Hearing,
<br> the Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.36</b>]
<br>
<br> So when she brought forth,
<br> she said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> Surely I have  brought it forth a female-- and Allah knew best what she brought  forth-- and the male is not like the female,
<br> and I have named it  Marium,
<br> and I commend her and her offspring into Thy protection  from the accursed Shaitan.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.37</b>]
<br>
<br> So her Lord accepted her with a good acceptance and made her  grow up a good growing,
<br> and gave her into the charge of Zakariya;
<br>  whenever Zakariya entered the sanctuary to (see) her,
<br> he found  with her food.
<br> He said:
<br> O Marium!
<br> whence comes this to you?
<br> She  said:
<br> It is from Allah.
<br> Surely Allah gives to whom He pleases  without measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.38</b>]
<br>
<br> There did Zakariya pray to his Lord;
<br> he said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> grant  me from Thee good offspring;
<br> surely Thou art the Hearer of  prayer.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Then the angels called to him as he stood praying in the  sanctuary:
<br> That Allah gives you the good news of Yahya verifying  a Word from Allah,
<br> and honorable and chaste and a prophet from  among the good ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.40</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> when shall there be a son (born) to me,
<br> and  old age has already come upon me,
<br> and my wife is barren?
<br> He said:
<br>  even thus does Allah what He pleases.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.41</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> appoint a sign for me.
<br> Said He:
<br> Your sign  is that you should not speak to men for three days except by  signs;
<br> and remember your Lord much and glorify Him in the evening  and the morning.
<br> f42.
<br> And when the angels said:
<br> O Marium!
<br> surely Allah has  chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women  of of the world.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.43</b>]
<br>
<br> O Marium!
<br> keep to obedience to your Lord and humble yourself,
<br>  and bow down with those who bow.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.44</b>]
<br>
<br> This is of the announcements relating to the unseen which We  reveal to you;
<br> and you were not with them when they cast  their pens (to decide) which of them should have Marium in his  charge,
<br> and you were not with them when they contended one with  another.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.45</b>]
<br>
<br> When the angels said:
<br> O Marium,
<br> surely Allah gives you  good news with a Word from Him (of one) whose name is the '.
<br>  Messiah,
<br> Isa son of Marium,
<br> worthy of regard in this world and  the hereafter and of those who are made near (to Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse3_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And he shall speak to the people when in the cradle and when  of old age,
<br> and (he shall be) one of the good ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.47</b>]
<br>
<br> She said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> when shall there be a son (born) to  I me,
<br> and man has not touched me?
<br> He said:
<br> Even so,
<br> Allah creates  what He pleases;
<br> when He has decreed a matter,
<br> He only says to  it,
<br> Be,
<br> and it is.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And He will teach him the Book and the wisdom and the  Tavrat and the Injeel.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And (make him) an apostle to the children of Israel:
<br> That I  have come to you with a sign from your Lord,
<br> that I determine for  you out of dust like the form of a bird,
<br> then I breathe into it  and it becomes a bird with Allah's permission and I heal the  blind and the leprous,
<br> and bring the dead to life with Allah's  permission and I inform you of what you should eat and what you  should store in your houses;
<br> most surely there is a sign in this  for you,
<br> if you are believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And a verifier of that which is before me of the Taurat and  that I may allow you part of that which has been forbidden t you,
<br>  and I have come to you with a sign from your Lord therefore be  careful of (your duty to) Allah and obey me.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.51</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord,
<br> therefore serve Him;
<br>  this is the right path.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.52</b>]
<br>
<br> But when Isa perceived unbelief on their part,
<br> he said Who  will be my helpers in Allah's way?
<br> The disciples said:
<br> We  are helpers (in the way) of Allah:
<br> We believe in Allah and bear  witness that we are submitting ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.53</b>]
<br>
<br> Our Lord!
<br> we believe in what Thou hast revealed and we  follow the apostle,
<br> so write us down with those who bear witness.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.54</b>]
<br>
<br> And they planned and Allah (also) planned,
<br> and Allah is  the best of planners.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Allah said:
<br> O Isa,
<br> I am going to terminate the  period of your stay (on earth) and cause you to ascend unto Me  and purify you of those who disbelieve and make those who  follow you above those who disbelieve to the day of resurrection;
<br>  then to Me shall be your return,
<br> so l will decide between you  concerning that in which you differed.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Then as to those who disbelieve,
<br> I will chastise them with  severe chastisement in this world and the hereafter,
<br> and they  shall have no helpers.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And as to those who believe and do good deeds,
<br> He will  pay them fully their rewards;
<br> and Allah does not love the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.58</b>]
<br>
<br> This We recite to you of the communications and the wise  reminder.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the likeness of Isa is with Allah as the likeness of  Adam;
<br> He created him from dust,
<br> then said to him,
<br> Be,
<br> and he  was.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.60</b>]
<br>
<br> (This is) the truth from your Lord,
<br> so be not of the  disputers.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.61</b>]
<br>
<br> But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what  has come to you of knowledge,
<br> then say:
<br> Come let us call our  sons and your sons and our women and your women and our  near people and your near people,
<br> then let us be earnest in  prayer,
<br> and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.62</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely this is the true explanation,
<br> and there is no  god but Allah;
<br> and most surely Allah-- He is the Mighty,
<br> the  Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.63</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they turn back,
<br> then surely Allah knows the mischief-makers.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O followers of the Book!
<br> come to an equitable proposition  between us and you that we shall not serve any but Allah  and (that) we shall not associate aught with Him,
<br> and (that)  some of us shall not take others for lords besides Allah;
<br> but if  they turn back,
<br> then say:
<br> Bear witness that we are Muslims.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.65</b>]
<br>
<br> O followers of the Book!
<br> why do you dispute about  Ibrahim,
<br> when the Taurat and the Injeel were not revealed till  after him;
<br> do you not then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse3_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Behold!
<br> you are they who disputed about that of which  you had knowledge;
<br> why then do you dispute about that of  which you have no knowledge?
<br> And Allah knows while you do  not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.67</b>]
<br>
<br> Ibrahim was not a Jew nor a Christian but he was (an) upright  (man),
<br> a Muslim,
<br> and he was not one of the polytheists.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.68</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely the nearest of people to Ibrahim are those who  followed him and this Prophet and those who believe and Allah is  the guardian of the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.69</b>]
<br>
<br> A party of the followers of the Book desire that they should  lead you astray,
<br> and they lead not astray but themselves,
<br> and  they do not perceive.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.70</b>]
<br>
<br> O followers of the Book!
<br> Why do you disbelieve in the  communications of Allah while you witness (them)?
<br>
<a name = "verse3_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.71</b>]
<br>
<br> O followers of the Book!
<br> Why do you confound the truth with  the falsehood and hide the truth while you know?
<br>
<a name = "verse3_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And a party of the followers of the Book say:
<br> Avow belief in  that which has been revealed to those who believe,
<br> in the first  part of the day,
<br> and disbelieve at the end of it,
<br> perhaps they go  back on their religion.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not believe but in him who follows your religion.
<br> Say:
<br>  Surely the (true) guidance is the guidance of Allah-- that one may  be given (by Him) the like of what you were given;
<br> or they would  contend with you by an argument before your Lord.
<br> Say:
<br> Surely  grace is in the hand of Allah,
<br> He gives it to whom He  pleases;
<br> and Allah is Ample-giving,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.74</b>]
<br>
<br> He specially chooses for His mercy whom He pleases;
<br> and Allah  is the Lord of mighty grace.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_72"></a>
<p>

<br> nor (at) what befell you;
<br> and  Allah is aware of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_151"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.154</b>]
<br>
<br> Then after sorrow He sent down security upon you,
<br> a  calm coming upon a party of you,
<br> and (there was) another party  whom their own souls had rendered anxious;
<br> they entertained  about Allah thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly,
<br> saying:
<br> We  have no hand in the affair.
<br> Say:
<br> Surely the affair is wholly (in the  hands) of Allah.
<br> They conceal within their souls what they  would not reveal to you.
<br> They say:
<br> Had we any hand in the  affair,
<br> we would not have been slain here.
<br> Say:
<br> Had you remained  in your houses,
<br> those for whom slaughter was ordained  would certainly have gone forth to the places where they would  be slain,
<br> and that Allah might test what was in your breasts and  that He might purge what was in your hearts;
<br> and Allah knows  what is in the breasts.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_152"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.155</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those of you who turned back on the day when  the two armies met,
<br> only the Shaitan sought to cause them to  make a slip on account of some deeds they had done,
<br> and  certainly Allah has pardoned them;
<br> surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br>  Forbearing.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_153"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.156</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> be not like those who disbelieve and  say of their brethren when they travel in the earth or engage in  fighting:
<br> Had they been with us,
<br> they would not have died and  they would not have been slain;
<br> so Allah makes this to be an  intense regret in their hearts;
<br> and Allah gives life and causes  death and Allah sees what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_154"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.157</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you are slain in the way of Allah or you die,
<br>  certainly forgiveness from Allah and mercy is better than what  they amass.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_155"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.158</b>]
<br>
<br> And if indeed you die or you are slain,
<br> certainly to Allah  shall you be gathered together.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_156"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.159</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus it is due to mercy from Allah that you deal with  them gently,
<br> and had you been rough,
<br> hard hearted,
<br> they would  certainly have dispersed from around you;
<br> pardon them therefore  and ask pardon for them,
<br> and take counsel with them in the  affair;
<br> so when you have decided,
<br> then place your trust in Allah;
<br>  surely Allah loves those who trust.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_157"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.160</b>]
<br>
<br> If Allah assists you,
<br> then there is none that can overcome  you,
<br> and if He forsakes you,
<br> who is there then that can assist  you after Him?
<br> And on Allah should the believers rely.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_158"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.161</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is not attributable to a prophet that he should act  unfaithfully;
<br> and he who acts unfaithfully shall bring that in  respect of which he has acted unfaithfully on the day of  resurrection;
<br> then shall every soul be paid back fully what it  has earned,
<br> and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_159"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.162</b>]
<br>
<br> Is then he who follows the pleasure of Allah like him who  has made himself deserving of displeasure from Allah,
<br> and his  abode is hell;
<br> and it is an evil destination.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_160"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.163</b>]
<br>
<br> There are (varying) grades with Allah,
<br> and Allah sees what  they do.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_161"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.164</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly Allah conferred a benefit upon the believers when  He raised among them an Apostle from among themselves,
<br> reciting  to them His communications and purifying them,
<br> and teaching them  the Book and the wisdom,
<br> although before that they were surely in  manifest error.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_162"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.165</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> when a misfortune befell you,
<br> and you had certainly  afflicted (the unbelievers) with twice as much,
<br> you began to say:
<br>  Whence is this?
<br> Say:
<br> It is from yourselves;
<br> surely Allah has  power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_163"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.166</b>]
<br>
<br> And what befell you on the day when the two armies met (at  Ohud) was with Allah's knowledge,
<br> and that He might know the  believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_164"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.167</b>]
<br>
<br> And that He might know the hypocrites;
<br> and it was said to  them:
<br> Come,
<br> fight in Allah's way,
<br> or defend yourselves.
<br> They  said:
<br> If we knew fighting,
<br> we would certainly have followed you.
<br>  They were on that day much nearer to unbelief than to belief.
<br>  They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts,
<br> and Allah  best knows what they conceal.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_165"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.168</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who said of their brethren whilst they (themselves)  held back:
<br> Had they obeyed us,
<br> they would not have been killed.
<br>  Say:
<br> Then avert death from yourselves if you speak the truth.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_166"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.169</b>]
<br>
<br> And reckon not those who are killed in Allah's way as dead;
<br>  nay,
<br> they are alive (and) are provided sustenance from their  Lord;
<br>
<a name = "verse3_167"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.170</b>]
<br>
<br> Rejoicing in what Allah has given them out of His grace and  they rejoice for the sake of those who,
<br> (being left) behind them,
<br>  have not yet joined them,
<br> that they shall have no fear,
<br> nor shall  they grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_168"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.171</b>]
<br>
<br> They rejoice on account of favor from Allah and (His) grace,
<br>  and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_169"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.172</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who responded (at Ohud) to the call of Allah  and the Apostle after the wound had befallen them,
<br> those among  them who do good (to others) and guard (against evil)shall have a  great reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_170"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.173</b>]
<br>
<br> Those to whom the people said:
<br> Surely men have gathered  against you,
<br> therefore fear them,
<br> but this increased their faith,
<br>  and they said:
<br> Allah is sufficient for us and most excellent is  the Protector.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_171"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.174</b>]
<br>
<br> So they returned with favor from Allah and (His) grace,
<br> no  evil touched them and they followed the pleasure of Allah;
<br> and  Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_172"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.175</b>]
<br>
<br> It is only the Shaitan that causes you to fear from his  friends,
<br> but do not fear them,
<br> and fear Me if you are believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_173"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.176</b>]
<br>
<br> And let not those grieve you who fall into unbelief hastily;
<br>  surely they can do no harm to Allah at all;
<br> Allah intends that He  should not give them any portion in the hereafter,
<br> and they shall  have a grievous chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_174"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.177</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who have bought unbelief at the price of faith  shall do no harm at all to Allah,
<br> and they shall have a painful  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_175"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.178</b>]
<br>
<br> And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them  respite is better for their souls;
<br> We grant them respite only  that they may add to their sins;
<br> and they shall have a  disgraceful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_176"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.179</b>]
<br>
<br> On no account will Allah leave the believers in the  condition which you are in until He separates the evil from the  good;
<br> nor is Allah going to make you acquainted with the unseen,
<br>  but Allah chooses of His apostles whom He pleases;
<br> therefore  believe in Allah and His apostles;
<br> and if you believe and guard  (against evil),
<br> then you shall have a great reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_177"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.180</b>]
<br>
<br> And let not those deem,
<br> who are niggardly in giving away  that which Allah has granted them out of His grace,
<br> that it is  good for them;
<br> nay,
<br> it is worse for them;
<br> they shall have that  whereof they were niggardly made to cleave to their necks on the  resurrection day;
<br> and Allah's is the heritage of the heavens and  the earth;
<br> and Allah is aware of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_178"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.181</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has certainly heard the saying of those who said:
<br>  Surely Allah is poor and we are rich.
<br> I will record what they  say,
<br> and their killing the prophets unjustly,
<br> and I will say:
<br>  Taste the chastisement of burning.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_179"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.182</b>]
<br>
<br> This is for what your own hands have sent before and because  Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_180"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.183</b>]
<br>
<br> (Those are they) who said:
<br> Surely Allah has enjoined us that  we should not believe in any apostle until he brings us an  offering which the fire consumes.
<br> Say:
<br> Indeed,
<br> there came to you  apostles before me with clear arguments and with that which you  demand;
<br> why then did you kill them if you are truthful?
<br>
<a name = "verse3_181"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.184</b>]
<br>
<br> But if they reject you,
<br> so indeed were rejected before you  apostles who came with clear arguments and scriptures and the  illuminating book.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_182"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.185</b>]
<br>
<br> Every soul shall taste of death,
<br> and you shall only be  paid fully your reward on the resurrection day;
<br> then whoever is  removed far away from the fire and is made to enter the garden  he indeed has attained the object;
<br> and the life of this world is  nothing but a provision of vanities.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_183"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.186</b>]
<br>
<br> You shall certainly be tried respecting your wealth and  your souls,
<br> and you shall certainly hear from those who have  been given the Book before you and from those who are polytheists  much annoying talk;
<br> and if you are patient and guard  (against evil),
<br> surely this is one of the affairs (which should be)  determined upon.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_184"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.187</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Allah made a covenant with those who were  given the Book:
<br> You shall certainly make it known to men and  you shall not hide it;
<br> but they cast it behind their backs and took  a small price for it;
<br> so evil is that which they buy.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_185"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.188</b>]
<br>
<br> Do not think those who rejoice for what they have done  and love that they should be praised for what they have not  done-- so do by no means think them to be safe from the  chastisement,
<br> and they shall have a painful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_186"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.189</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth,
<br>  and Allah has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_187"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.190</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth  and the alternation of the night and the day there are signs for  men who understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_188"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.191</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who remember Allah standing and sitting and  lying on their sides and reflect on the creation of the heavens and  the earth:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> Thou hast not created this in vain!
<br> Glory be  to Thee;
<br> save us then from the chastisement of the fire:
<br>
<a name = "verse3_189"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.192</b>]
<br>
<br> Our Lord!
<br> surely whomsoever Thou makest enter the  fire,
<br> him Thou hast indeed brought to disgrace,
<br> and there shall  be no helpers for the unjust:
<br>
<a name = "verse3_190"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.193</b>]
<br>
<br> Our Lord!
<br> surely we have heard a preacher calling to the  faith,
<br> saying:
<br> Believe in your Lord,
<br> so we did believe;
<br> Our Lord!
<br>  forgive us therefore our faults,
<br> and cover our evil deeds and  make us die with the righteous.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_191"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.194</b>]
<br>
<br> Our Lord!
<br> and grant us what Thou hast promised us by  Thy apostles;
<br> and disgrace us not on the day of resurrection;
<br>  surely Thou dost not fail to perform the promise.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_192"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.195</b>]
<br>
<br> So their Lord accepted their prayer:
<br> That I will not waste  the work of a worker among you,
<br> whether male or female,
<br> the  one of you being from the other;
<br> they,
<br> therefore,
<br> who fled and  were turned out of their homes and persecuted in My way and  who fought and were slain,
<br> I will most certainly cover their evil  deeds,
<br> and I will most certainly make them enter gardens beneath  which rivers flow;
<br> a reward from Allah,
<br> and with Allah is yet  better reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_193"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.196</b>]
<br>
<br> Let it not deceive you that those who disbelieve go to and  fro in the cities fearlessly.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_194"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.197</b>]
<br>
<br> A brief enjoyment!
<br> then their abode is hell,
<br> and evil is the  resting-place.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_195"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.198</b>]
<br>
<br> But as to those who are careful of (their duty to) their  Lord,
<br> they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow,
<br> abiding  in them;
<br> an entertainment from their Lord,
<br> and that which is  with Allah is best for the righteous.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_196"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.199</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely of the followers of the Book there are  those who believe in Allah and (in) that which has been revealed  to you and (in) that which has been revealed to them,
<br> being  lowly before Allah;
<br> they do not take a small price for the  communications of Allah;
<br> these it is that have their reward with  their Lord;
<br> surely Allah is quick in reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse3_197"></a>
<p>
[<b>3.200</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> be patient and excel in patience and  remain steadfast,
<br> and be careful of (your duty to) Allah,
<br> that you  may be successful.
