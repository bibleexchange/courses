<p><h3>Book 52</h3>
<br><h3>The Mountain</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse52_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.1</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the Mountain,
<br>
<a name = "verse52_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.2</b>]
<br>
 And the Book written<br>
<a name = "verse52_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.3</b>]
<br>
<br> In an outstretched fine parchment,
<br>
<a name = "verse52_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And the House (Kaaba) that is visited,
  <br>
<a name = "verse52_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.5</b>]
<br>
  And the elevated canopy<br>
<a name = "verse52_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.6</b>]
<br>
 And the swollen sea<br>
<a name = "verse52_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely the punishment of your Lord will come to  pass;
<br>
<a name = "verse52_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.8</b>]
<br>
<br> There shall be none to avert it;
<br>
<a name = "verse52_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.9</b>]
<br>
 On the day when the heaven shall move from side to side<br>
<a name = "verse52_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And the mountains shall pass away passing away  (altogether).
<br>
<a name = "verse52_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.11</b>]
<br>
<br> So woe on that day to those who reject (the truth),
<br>
<a name = "verse52_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who sport entering into vain discourses.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.13</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which they shall be driven away to the fire  of hell with violence.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.14</b>]
<br>
<br> This is the fire which you used to give the lie to.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Is it magic then or do you not see?
<br>
<a name = "verse52_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Enter into it,
<br> then bear (it) patiently,
<br> or do not bear  (it) patiently,
<br> it is the same to you;
<br> you shall be requited  only (for) what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.17</b>]
<br>
 Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in  gardens and bliss<br>
<a name = "verse52_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Rejoicing because of what their Lord gave them,
<br> and  their Lord saved them from the punishment of the burning  fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Eat and drink pleasantly for what you did,
<br>
<a name = "verse52_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Reclining on thrones set in lines,
<br> and We will unite  them to large-eyed beautiful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who believe and their offspring  follow them in faith,
<br> We will unite with them their  offspring and We will not diminish to them aught of their  work;
<br> every man is responsible for what he shall have  wrought.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And We will aid them with fruit and flesh such as they  desire.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.23</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall pass therein from one to another a cup  wherein there shall be nothing vain nor any sin.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And round them shall go boys of theirs as if they were  hidden pearls.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And some of them shall advance towards others  questioning each other.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Saying:
<br> Surely we feared before on account of our  families:
<br>
<a name = "verse52_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.27</b>]
<br>
<br> But Allah has been gracious to us and He has saved us  from the punishment of the hot wind:
<br>
<a name = "verse52_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely we called upon Him before:
<br> Surely He is the  Benign,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore continue to remind,
<br> for by the grace of your  Lord,
<br> you are not a soothsayer,
<br> or a madman.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they say:
<br> A poet,
<br> we wait for him the evil  accidents of time.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Wait,
<br> for surely I too with you am of those who  wait.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> do their understandings bid them this?
<br> Or are they  an inordinate people?
<br>
<a name = "verse52_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they say:
<br> He has forged it.
<br> Nay!
<br> they do not  believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Then let them bring an announcement like it if they are  truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Or were they created without there being anything,
<br> or  are they the creators?
<br>
<a name = "verse52_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Or did they create the heavens and the earth?
<br> Nay!
<br> they  have no certainty.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they the treasures of your Lord with them?
<br> Or  have they been set in absolute authority?
<br>
<a name = "verse52_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they the means by which they listen?
<br> Then let  their listener bring a clear authority.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Or has He daughters while you have sons?
<br>
<a name = "verse52_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do you ask them for a reward,
<br> so that they are  overburdened by a debt?
<br>
<a name = "verse52_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they the unseen so that they write (it) down?
<br>
<a name = "verse52_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they desire a war?
<br> But those who disbelieve shall  be the vanquished ones in war.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they a god other than Allah?
<br> Glory be to Allah  from what they set up (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse52_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they should see a portion of the heaven coming  down,
<br> they would say:
<br> Piled up clouds.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Leave them then till they meet that day of theirs  wherein they shall be made to swoon (with terror):
<br>
<a name = "verse52_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.46</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which their struggle shall not avail them  aught,
<br> nor shall they be helped.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely those who are unjust shall have a punishment  besides that (in the world),
<br> but most of them do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse52_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.48</b>]
<br>
<br> And wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord,
<br> for  surely you are before Our eyes,
<br> and sing the praise of your  Lord when you rise;
<br>
<a name = "verse52_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>52.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And in the night,
<br> give Him glory too,
<br> and at the setting  of the stars.
