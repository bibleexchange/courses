<p><h3>Book 7</h3>
<br><h3>The Elevated Places</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse7_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Mim Suad.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.2</b>]
<br>
<br> A Book revealed to you-- so let there be no straitness in  your breast on account of it-- that you may warn thereby,
<br> and a  reminder close to the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord and  do not follow guardians besides Him,
<br> how little do you mind.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many a town that We destroyed,
<br> so Our punishment  came to it by night or while they slept at midday.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Yet their cry,
<br> when Our punishment came to them,
<br> was  nothing but that they said:
<br> Surely we were unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Most certainly then We will question those to whom (the  apostles) were sent,
<br> and most certainly We will also question the  apostles;
<br>
<a name = "verse7_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Then most certainly We will relate to them with knowledge,
<br>  and We were not absent.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And the measuring out on that day will be just;
<br> then as for  him whose measure (of good deeds) is heavy,
<br> those are they who  shall be successful;
<br>
<a name = "verse7_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for him whose measure (of good deeds) is light  those are they who have made their souls suffer loss because they  disbelieved in Our communications.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have established you in the earth and  made in it means of livelihood for you;
<br> little it is that you give  thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We created you,
<br> then We fashioned you,
<br>  then We said to the angels:
<br> Make obeisance to Adam.
<br> So they  did obeisance except Iblis;
<br> he was not of those who did  obeisance.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.12</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> What hindered you so that you did not make  obeisance when I commanded you?
<br> He said:
<br> I am better than he:
<br>  Thou hast created me of fire,
<br> while him Thou didst create of  dust.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.13</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Then get forth from this (state),
<br> for it does not  befit you to behave proudly therein.
<br> Go forth,
<br> therefore,
<br> surely  you are of the abject ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.14</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Respite me until the day when they are raised up.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.15</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Surely you are of the respited ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.16</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> As Thou hast caused me to remain disappointed  I will certainly lie in wait for them in Thy straight path.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Then I will certainly come to them from before them and  from behind them,
<br> and from their right-hand side and from their  left-hand side;
<br> and Thou shalt not find most of them thankful.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.18</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Get out of this (state),
<br> despised,
<br> driven away;
<br>  whoever of them will follow you,
<br> I will certainly fill hell with you  all.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And (We said):
<br> O Adam!
<br> Dwell you and your wife in the  garden;
<br> so eat from where you desire,
<br> but do not go near this  tree,
<br> for then you will be of the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.20</b>]
<br>
<br> But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to them that he  might make manifest to them what had been hidden from them  of their evil inclinations,
<br> and he said:
<br> Your Lord has not forbidden  you this tree except that you may not both become two  angels or that you may (not) become of the immortals.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And he swore to them both:
<br> Most surely I am a sincere  adviser to you.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he caused them to fall by deceit;
<br> so when they tasted  of the tree,
<br> their evil inclinations became manifest to them,
<br> and  they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the  garden;
<br> and their Lord called out to them:
<br> Did I not forbid you  both from that tree and say to you that the Shaitan is your open  enemy?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.23</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> We have been unjust to ourselves,
<br>  and if Thou forgive us not,
<br> and have (not) mercy on us,
<br> we shall  certainly be of the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.24</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Get forth,
<br> some of you,
<br> the enemies of others,
<br>  and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a  time.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.25</b>]
<br>
<br> He (also) said:
<br> Therein shall you live,
<br> and therein shall  you die,
<br> and from it shall you be raised.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.26</b>]
<br>
<br> O children of Adam!
<br> We have indeed sent down to you  clothing to cover your shame,
<br> and (clothing) for beauty and  clothing that guards (against evil),
<br> that is the best.
<br> This is of the  communications of Allah that they may be mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.27</b>]
<br>
<br> O children of Adam!
<br> let not the Shaitan cause you to fall  into affliction as he expelled your parents from the garden,
<br>  pulling off from them both their clothing that he might show  them their evil inclinations,
<br> he surely sees you,
<br> he as well as his  host,
<br> from whence you cannot see them;
<br> surely We have made  the Shaitans to be the guardians of those who do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they commit an indecency they say:
<br> We found  our fathers doing this,
<br> and Allah has enjoined it on us.
<br> Say:
<br>  Surely Allah does not enjoin indecency;
<br> do you say against Allah  what you do not know?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> My Lord has enjoined justice,
<br> and set upright your  faces at every time of prayer and call on Him,
<br> being sincere to  Him in obedience;
<br> as He brought you forth in the beginning,
<br> so  shall you also return.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.30</b>]
<br>
<br> A part has He guided aright and (as for another) part,
<br>  error is justly their due,
<br> surely they took the Shaitans for guardians  beside Allah,
 and they think that they are followers of the right<br>
<a name = "verse7_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.31</b>]
<br>
<br> O children of Adam!
<br> attend to your embellishments at  every time of prayer,
<br> and eat and drink and be not extravagant;
<br>  surely He does not love the extravagant.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Who has prohibited the embellishment of Allah which  He has brought forth for His servants and the good provisions?
<br>  Say:
<br> These are for the believers in the life of this world,
<br> purely  (theirs) on the resurrection day;
<br> thus do We make the communications  clear for a people who know.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> My Lord has only prohibited indecencies,
<br> those of  them that are apparent as well as those that are concealed,
<br> and  sin and rebellion without justice,
<br> and that you associate with  Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority,
<br> and  that you say against Allah what you do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And for every nation there is a doom,
<br> so when their doom  is come they shall not remain behind the least while,
<br> nor shall  they go before.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.35</b>]
<br>
<br> O children of Adam!
<br> if there come to you apostles from  among you relating to you My communications,
<br> then whoever  shall guard (against evil) and act aright-- they shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve.
  <br>
<a name = "verse7_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who reject Our communications and  turn away from them haughtily-- these are the inmates of the fire  they shall abide in it.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against  Allah or rejects His communications?
<br> (As for) those,
<br> their portion  of the Book shall reach them,
<br> until when Our messengers  come to them causing them to die,
<br> they shall say:
<br> Where is that  which you used to call upon besides Allah?
<br> They would say:
<br>  They are gone away from us;
 and they shall bear witness against  themselves that they were unbelievers<br>
<a name = "verse7_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.38</b>]
<br>
<br> He will say:
<br> Enter into fire among the nations that have  passed away before you from among jinn and men;
<br> whenever a  nation shall enter,
<br> it shall curse its sister,
<br> until when they have all  come up with one another into it;
<br> the last of them shall say with  regard to the foremost of them:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> these led us astray  therefore give them a double chastisement of the fire.
<br> He will  say:
<br> Every one shall have double but you do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.39</b>]
<br>
<br> And the foremost of them will say to the last of them:
<br> So  you have no preference over us;
<br> therefore taste the chastisement  for what you earned.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who reject Our communications and  turn away from them haughtily,
<br> the doors of heaven shall not be  opened for them,
<br> nor shall they enter the garden until the camel  pass through the eye of the needle;
<br> and thus do We reward the  guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.41</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall have a bed of hell-fire and from above them  coverings (of it);
<br> and thus do We reward the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who believe and do good We do not  impose on any soul a duty except to the extent of its ability--  they are the dwellers of the garden;
<br> in it they shall abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.43</b>]
<br>
<br> And We will remove whatever of ill-feeling is in their  breasts;
<br> the rivers shall flow beneath them and they shall say:
<br> All  praise is due to Allah Who guided us to this,
<br> and we would not  have found the way had it not been that Allah had guided us;
<br>  certainly the apostles of our Lord brought the truth;
<br> and it shall  be cried out to them that this is the garden of which you are  made heirs for what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.44</b>]
<br>
<br> And the dwellers of the garden will call out to the inmates  of the fire:
<br> Surely we have found what our Lord promised us to  be true;
<br> have you too found what your Lord promised to be  true?
<br> They will say:
<br> Yes.
<br> Then a crier will cry out among them  that the curse of Allah is on the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.45</b>]
<br>
<br> Who hinder (people) from Allah's way and seek to make it  crooked,
<br> and they are disbelievers in the hereafter.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And between the two there shall be a veil,
<br> and on the most  elevated places there shall be men who know all by their marks,
<br>  and they shall call out to the dwellers of the garden:
<br> Peace be on  you;
<br> they shall not have yet entered it,
<br> though they hope.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And when their eyes shall be turned towards the inmates of  the fire,
<br> they shall say:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> place us not with the unjust    48 And the dwellers of the most elevated places shall ca!
<br>l out  to men whom they will recognize by their marks saying:
<br> Of no  avail were to you your amassings and your behaving haughtily:
<br>
<a name = "verse7_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Are these they about whom you swore that Allah will not  bestow mercy on them?
<br> Enter the garden;
<br> you shall have no fear,
<br>  nor shall you grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.50</b>]
<br>
<br> And the inmates of the fire shall call out to the dwellers of  the garden,
<br> saying:
<br> Pour on us some water or of that which Allah  has given you.
<br> They shall say:
<br> Surely Allah has prohibited them  both to the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.51</b>]
<br>
<br> Who take their religion for an idle sport and a play and this  life's world deceives them;
<br> so today We forsake them,
<br> as they  neglected the meeting of this day of theirs and as they denied Our  communications.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have brought them a Book which We  have made clear with knowledge,
<br> a guidance and a mercy for a  people who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.53</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they wait for aught but its final sequel?
<br> On the day when  its final sequel comes about,
<br> those who neglected it before will  say:
<br> Indeed the apostles of our Lord brought the truth;
<br> are there  for us then any intercessors so that they should intercede on our  behalf?
<br> Or could we be sent back so that we should do (deeds)  other than those which we did?
<br> Indeed they have lost their souls  and that which they forged has gone away from them.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely your Lord is Allah,
<br> Who created the heavens and  the earth in six periods of time,
<br> and He is firm in power;
<br> He  throws the veil of night over the day,
<br> which it pursues  incessantly;
<br> and (He created) the sun and the moon and the stars,
<br> made  subservient by His command;
<br> surely His is the creation and the  command;
<br> blessed is Allah,
<br> the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Call on your Lord humbly and secretly;
<br> surely He does not  love those who exceed the limits.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.56</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not make mischief in the earth after its reformation,
<br>  and call on Him fearing and hoping;
<br> surely the mercy of  Allah is nigh to those who do good (to others).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.57</b>]
<br>
<br> And He it is Who sends forth the winds bearing good news  before His mercy,
<br> until,
<br> when they bring up a laden cloud,
<br> We  drive it to a dead land,
<br> then We send down water on it,
<br> then bring  forth with it of fruits of all kinds;
<br> thus shall We bring forth the  dead that you may be mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for the good land,
<br> its vegetation springs forth  (abundantly) by the permission of its Lord,
<br> and (as for) that which  is inferior (its herbage) comes forth but scantily;
<br> thus do We  repeat the communications for a people who give thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly We sent Nuh to his people,
<br> so he said:
<br> O my  people!
<br> serve Allah,
<br> you have no god other than Him;
<br> surely I fear  for you the chastisement of a grievous day.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.60</b>]
<br>
<br> The chiefs of his people said:
<br> Most surely we see you in  clear error.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.61</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my people!
<br> there is no error in me,
<br> but I am an  apostle from the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.62</b>]
<br>
<br> I deliver to you the messages of my Lord,
<br> and I offer you  good advice and I know from Allah what you do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.63</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do you wonder that a reminder has come to you  from your Lord through a man from among you,
<br> that he might  warn you and that you might guard (against evil) and so that  mercy may be shown to you?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.64</b>]
<br>
<br> But they called him a liar,
<br> so We delivered him and those  with him in the ark,
<br> and We drowned those who rejected Our  communications;
<br> surely they were a blind people.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.65</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hud.
<br> He said:
<br> O my  people!
<br> serve Allah,
<br> you have no god other than Him;
<br> will you not  then guard (against evil)?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.66</b>]
<br>
<br> The chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people  said:
<br> Most surely we see you in folly,
<br> and most surely we think you  to be of the liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.67</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O my people!
<br> there is no folly in me,
<br> but I am an  apostle of the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.68</b>]
<br>
<br> I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and I am a faithful  adviser to you:
<br>
<a name = "verse7_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.69</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do you wonder that a reminder has come to you  from your Lord through a man from among you that he might  warn you?
<br> And remember when He made you successors after  Nuh's people and increased you in excellence in respect of make;
<br>  therefore remember the benefits of Allah,
<br> that you may be  successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.70</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Have you come to us that we may serve Allah  alone and give up what our fathers used to serve?
<br> Then bring to us  what you threaten us with,
<br> if you are of the truthful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.71</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Indeed uncleanness and wrath from your Lord  have lighted upon you;
<br> what!
<br> do you dispute with me about  names which you and your fathers have given?
<br> Allah has not sent  any authority for them;
<br> wait then,
<br> I too with you will be of those  who wait.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.72</b>]
<br>
<br> So We delivered him and those with him by mercy from Us,
<br>  and We cut off the last of those who rejected Our communications  and were not believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Samood (We sent) their brother Salih.
<br> He said:
<br> O  my people!
<br> serve Allah,
<br> you have no god other than Him;
<br> clear  proof indeed has come to you from your Lord;
<br> this is (as) Allah's  she-camel for you-- a sign,
<br> therefore leave her alone to pasture on  Allah's earth,
<br> and do not touch her with any harm,
<br> otherwise  painful chastisement will overtake you.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And remember when He made you successors after Ad and  settled you in the land-- you make mansions on its plains and hew  out houses in the mountains-- remember therefore Allah's benefits  and do not act corruptly in the land,
<br> making mischief.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.75</b>]
<br>
<br> The chief of those who behaved proudly among his people  said to those who were considered weak,
<br> to those who believed  from among them:
<br> Do you know that Salih is sent by his Lord?
<br>  They said:
 Surely we are believers in what he has been sent with<br>
<a name = "verse7_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.76</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who were haughty said:
<br> Surely we are deniers of  what you believe in.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.77</b>]
<br>
<br> So they slew the she-camel and revolted against their  Lord's commandment,
<br> and they said:
<br> O Salih!
<br> bring us what you  threatened us with,
<br> if you are one of the apostles.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.78</b>]
<br>
<br> Then the earthquake overtook them,
<br> so they became  motionless bodies in their abode.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.79</b>]
<br>
<br> Then he turned away from them and said:
<br> O my people I  did certainly deliver to you the message of my Lord,
<br> and I gave  you good advice,
<br> but you do not love those who give good advice.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And (We sent) Lut when he said to his people:
<br> What!
<br> do  you commit an indecency which any one in the world has not done  before you?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.81</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely you come to males in lust besides females;
<br> nay  you are an extravagant people.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And the answer of his people was no other than that they  said:
<br> Turn them out of your town,
<br> surely they are a people who  seek to purify (themselves).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.83</b>]
<br>
<br> So We delivered him and his followers,
<br> except his wife;
<br> she  was of those who remained behind.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.84</b>]
<br>
<br> And We rained upon them a rain;
<br> consider then what was  the end of the guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.85</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Madyan (We sent) their brother Shu'aib.
<br> He said:
<br> 0  my people!
<br> serve Allah,
<br> you have no god other than Him;
<br> clear  proof indeed has come to you from your Lord,
<br> therefore give full  measure and weight and do not diminish to men their things,
<br> and  do not make mischief in the land after its reform;
<br> this is better for  you if you are believers:
<br>
<a name = "verse7_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.86</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not lie in wait in every path,
<br> threatening and  turning away from Allah's way him who believes in Him and  seeking to make it crooked;
<br> and remember when you were few  then He multiplied you,
<br> and consider what was the end of the  mischief-makers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.87</b>]
<br>
<br> And if there is a party of you who believe in that with which  am sent,
<br> and another party who do not believe,
<br> then wait patiently  until Allah judges between us;
<br> and He is the best of the Judges.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.88</b>]
<br>
<br> The chiefs,
<br> those who were proud from among his people  said:
<br> We will most certainly turn you out,
<br> O Shu'aib,
<br> and (also;
<br>  those who believe with you,
<br> from our town,
<br> or you shall come  back to our faith.
<br> He said:
<br> What!
<br> though we dislike (it)?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.89</b>]
<br>
<br> Indeed we shall have forged a lie against Allah If we go  back to your religion after Allah has delivered us from It,
<br> and it  befits us not that we should go back to it,
<br> except if Allah our  Lord please:
<br> Our Lord comprehends all things :
<br>n His knowledge;
<br>  in Allah do we trust:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> decide between us and our  people with truth;
<br> and Thou art the best of deciders.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.90</b>]
<br>
<br> And the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his  people said:
<br> If you follow Shu'aib,
 you shall then most surely be  losers<br>
<a name = "verse7_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.91</b>]
<br>
<br> Then the earthquake overtook them,
<br> so they became motionless  bodies in their abode.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.92</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who called Shu'aib a liar were as though they had  never dwelt therein;
<br> those who called Shu'aib a liar,
<br> they were  the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.93</b>]
<br>
<br> So he turned away from them and said:
<br> O my people!
<br>  certainly I delivered to you the messages of my Lord and I gave  you good advice;
<br> how shall I then be sorry for an unbelieving  people?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.94</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not send a prophet in a town but We overtook  its people with distress and affliction in order that they  might humble themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.95</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We gave them good in the place of evil until they  became many and said:
<br> Distress and happiness did indeed befall  our fathers.
<br> Then We took them by surprise while they did not  perceive.
<br>    96 And if the people of the towns had believed and guarded  (against evil) We would certainly have opened up for them  blessings from the heaven and the earth,
<br> but they rejected,
<br> so We  overtook them for what they had earned.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.97</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do the people of the towns then feel secure from  Our punishment coming to them by night while they sleep?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.98</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do the people of the towns feel secure from Our  punishment coming to them in the morning while they play?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.99</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> do they then feel secure from Allah's plan?
<br> But  none feels secure from Allah's plan except the people who shall  perish.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.100</b>]
<br>
<br> Is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after its  (former) residents that if We please We would afflict them on  account of their faults and set a seal on their hearts so they  would not hear.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.101</b>]
<br>
<br> These towns-- We relate to you some of their stories,
<br> and  certainly their apostles came to them with clear arguments,
<br> but  they would not believe in what they rejected at first;
 thus does  Allah set a seal over the hearts of the unbelievers<br>
<a name = "verse7_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.102</b>]
<br>
<br> And We did not find in most of them any (faithfulness  to) covenant,
<br> and We found most of them to be certainly transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.103</b>]
<br>
<br> Then we raised after them Musa with Our communications  to Firon and his chiefs,
<br> but they disbelieved in them;
<br>  consider then what was the end of the mischief makers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.104</b>]
<br>
<br> And Musa said:
<br> O Firon!
<br> surely I am an apostle from the  Lord of the worlds:
<br>
<a name = "verse7_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.105</b>]
<br>
<br> (I am) worthy of not saying anything about Allah except  the truth:
<br> I have come to you indeed with clear proof from your  Lord,
 therefore send with me the children of Israel<br>
<a name = "verse7_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.106</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> If you have come with a sign,
<br> then bring it,
<br> if  you are of the truthful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.107</b>]
<br>
<br> So he threw his rod,
<br> then lo!
<br> it was a clear serpent.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.108</b>]
<br>
<br> And he drew forth his hand,
<br> and lo!
<br> it was white to the  beholders.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.109</b>]
<br>
<br> The chiefs of Firon's people said:
<br> most surely this is an  enchanter possessed of knowledge:
<br>
<a name = "verse7_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.110</b>]
<br>
<br> He intends to turn you out of your land.
<br> What counsel  do you then give?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.111</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Put him off and his brother,
<br> and send collectors  into the cities:
<br>
<a name = "verse7_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.112</b>]
<br>
<br> That they may bring to you every enchanter possessed of  knowledge.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.113</b>]
<br>
<br> And the enchanters came to Firon (and) said:
<br> We must  surely have a reward if we are the prevailing ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_112"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.114</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Yes,
<br> and you shall certainly be of those who are  near (to me).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_113"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.115</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> will you cast,
<br> or shall we be the first  to cast?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_114"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.116</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Cast.
<br> So when they cast,
<br> they deceived the  people's eyes and frightened them,
<br> and they produced a mighty  enchantment.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_115"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.117</b>]
<br>
<br> And We revealed to Musa,
<br> saying:
<br> Cast your rod;
<br> then  lo!
<br> it devoured the lies they told.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_116"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.118</b>]
<br>
<br> So the truth was established,
<br> and what they did became  null.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_117"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.119</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus they were vanquished there,
<br> and they went back  abased.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_118"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.120</b>]
<br>
<br> And the enchanters were thrown down,
<br> prostrating (themselves).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_119"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.121</b>]
<br>
<br>  They said:
<br> We believe in the Lord of the worlds,
<br>
<a name = "verse7_120"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.122</b>]
<br>
<br> The Lord of Musa and Haroun.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_121"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.123</b>]
<br>
<br> Firon said:
<br> Do you believe in Him before I have given  you permission?
<br> Surely this is a plot which you have secretly  devised in this city,
<br> that you may turn out of it its people,
<br> but  you shall know:
<br>
<a name = "verse7_122"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.124</b>]
<br>
<br> 1 will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on  opposite sides,
<br> then will I crucify you all together.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_123"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.125</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Surely to our Lord shall we go back:
<br>
<a name = "verse7_124"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.126</b>]
<br>
<br> And you do not take revenge on us except because we  have believed in the communications of our Lord when they  came to us!
<br> Our Lord:
<br> Pour out upon us patience and cause us  to die in submission.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_125"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.127</b>]
<br>
<br> And the chiefs of Firon's people said:
<br> Do you leave  Musa and his people to make mischief in the land and to forsake  you and your gods?
<br> He said:
<br> We will slay their sons and spare  their women,
<br> and surely we are masters over them.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_126"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.128</b>]
<br>
<br> Musa said to his people:
<br> Ask help from Allah and be  patient;
<br> surely the land is Allah's;
<br> He causes such of His servants  to inherit it as He pleases,
<br> and the end is for those who guard  (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_127"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.129</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> We have been persecuted before you came to  us and since you have come to us.
<br> He said:
<br> It may be that your  Lord will destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land,
<br>  then He will see how you act.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_128"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.130</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We overtook Firon's people with droughts  and diminution of fruits that they may be mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_129"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.131</b>]
<br>
<br> But when good befell them they said:
<br> This is due to us;
<br>  and when evil afflicted them,
<br> they attributed it to the ill-luck of  Musa and those with him;
<br> surely their evil fortune is only from  Allah but most of them do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_130"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.132</b>]
<br>
<br> And they said:
<br> Whatever sign you may bring to us to  charm us with it-- we will not believe in you.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_131"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.133</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore We sent upon them widespread death,
<br> and the  locusts and the lice and the frog and the blood,
<br> clear signs;
<br> but  they behaved haughtily and they were a guilty people.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_132"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.134</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the plague fell upon them,
<br> they said:
<br> O Musa!
<br>  pray for us to your Lord as He has promised with you,
<br> if you  remove the plague from us,
<br> we will certainly believe in you and  we will certainly send away with you the children of Israel.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_133"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.135</b>]
<br>
<br> But when We removed the plague from them till a term  which they should attain lo!
<br> they broke (the promise).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_134"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.136</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore We inflicted retribution on them and drowned  them in the sea because they rejected Our signs and were heedless  of them.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_135"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.137</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made the people who were deemed weak to inherit the eastern lands and the western ones which We had  blessed;
<br> and the good word of your Lord was fulfilled in the  children of Israel because they bore up (sufferings) patiently;
<br> and  We utterly destroyed what Firon and his people had wrought  and what they built.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_136"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.138</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made the children of Israel to pass the sea;
<br> then  they came upon a people who kept to the worship of their idols  They said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> make for us a god as they have (their) gods  He said:
<br> Surely you are a people acting ignorantly:
<br>
<a name = "verse7_137"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.139</b>]
<br>
<br> (As to) these,
<br> surely that about which they are shall be  brought to naught and that which they do is vain.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_138"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.140</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> What!
<br> shall I seek for you a god other than  Allah while He has made you excel (all) created things?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_139"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.141</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We delivered you from Firon's people who  subJected you to severe torment,
<br> killing your sons and sparing  your women,
<br> and in this there was a great trial from your Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_140"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.142</b>]
<br>
<br> And We appointed with Musa a time of thirty nights and  completed them with ten (more),
<br> so the appointed time of his  Lord was complete forty nights,
<br> and Musa said to his brother  Haroun:
<br> Take my place among my people,
<br> and act well and do  not follow the way of the mischief-makers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_141"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.143</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Musa came at Our appointed time and his  Lord spoke to him,
<br> he said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> show me (Thyself),
<br> so that  I may look upon Thee.
<br> He said:
<br> You cannot (bear to) see Me  but look at the mountain,
<br> if it remains firm in its place,
<br> then will  you see Me;
<br> but when his Lord manifested His glory to the  mountain He made it crumble and Musa fell down in a swoon;
<br>  then when he recovered,
<br> he said:
<br> Glory be to Thee,
<br> I turn to  Thee,
<br> and I am the first of the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_142"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.144</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> O Musa!
<br> surely I have chosen you above the  people with My messages and with My words,
<br> therefore take  hold of what I give to you and be of the grateful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_143"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.145</b>]
<br>
<br> And We ordained for him in the tablets admonition of  every kind and clear explanation of all things;
<br> so take hold of  them with firmness and enjoin your people to take hold of what  is best thereof;
<br> I will show you the abode of the transgressors.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_144"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.146</b>]
<br>
<br> 1 will turn away from My communications those who are  unjustly proud in the earth;
<br> and if they see every sign they will  not believe m It;
<br> and if they see the way of rectitude they do not  take It for a way,
<br> and if they see the way of error.
<br> they take it for  a way;
<br> this is because they rejected Our communications and  were heedless of them.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_145"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.147</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as to) those who reject Our communications and  the meeting of the hereafter,
<br> their deeds are null.
<br> Shall they be  rewarded except for what they have done?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_146"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.148</b>]
<br>
<br> And Musa's people made of their ornaments a calf after  him,
<br> a (mere) body,
<br> which gave a mooing sound.
<br> What!
<br> could  they not see that it did not speak to them nor guide them m the  way?
<br> They took it (for worship) and they were unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_147"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.149</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they repented and saw that they had gone  astray,
<br> they said:
<br> If our Lord show not mercy to us and forgive  us we shall certainly be of the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_148"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.150</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Musa returned to his people,
<br> wrathful (and)  in violent grief,
<br> he said:
<br> Evil is it that you have done after me;
<br> did  you turn away from the bidding of your Lord?
<br> And he threw  down the tablets and seized his brother by the head,
<br> dragging  him towards him.
<br> He said:
<br> Son of my mother!
<br> surely the people  reckoned me weak and had well-nigh slain me,
<br> therefore make  not the enemies to rejoice over me and count me not among the  unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_149"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.151</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> My Lord!
<br> forgive me and my brother and cause  us to enter into Thy mercy,
<br> and Thou art the most Merciful of  the merciful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_150"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.152</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those who took the calf (for a god),
<br> surely wrath  from their Lord and disgrace in this world's life shall overtake  them,
<br> and thus do We recompense the devisers of lies.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_151"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.153</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as to) those who do evil deeds,
<br> then repent after  that and believe,
<br> your Lord after that is most surely Forgiving,
<br>  Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_152"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.154</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Musa's anger calmed down he took up the  tablets,
<br> and in the writing thereof was guidance and mercy for  those who fear for the sake of their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_153"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.155</b>]
<br>
<br> And Musa chose out of his people seventy men for Our  appointment;
<br> so when the earthquake overtook them,
<br> he said:
<br>  My Lord!
<br> if Thou hadst pleased,
<br> Thou hadst destroyed them  before and myself (too);
<br> wilt Thou destroy us for what the fools  among us have done?
<br> It is naught but Thy trial,
<br> Thou makest err  with it whom Thou pleasest and guidest whom Thou pleasest:
<br>  Thou art our Guardian,
<br> therefore forgive us and have mercy on  us,
<br> and Thou art the best of the forgivers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_154"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.156</b>]
<br>
<br> And ordain for us good in this world's life and m the  hereafter,
<br> for surely we turn to Thee.
<br> He said:
<br> (As for) My  chastisement,
<br> I will afflict with it whom I please,
<br> and My mercy  encompasses all things;
<br> so I will ordain it (specially) for those  who guard (against evil) and pay the poor-rate,
<br> and those who  believe in Our communications.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_155"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.157</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who follow the Apostle-Prophet,
<br> the Ummi,
<br> whom  they find written down with them in the Taurat and the Injeel  (who) enjoins them good and forbids them evil,
<br> and makes  lawful to them the good things and makes unlawful to them  impure things,
<br> and removes from them their burden and the  shackles which were upon them;
<br> so (as for) those who believe in  him and honor him and help him,
<br> and follow the light which has  been sent down with him,
<br> these it is that are the successful.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_156"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.158</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> O people!
<br> surely I am the Apostle of Allah to you  all,
<br> of Him Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth  there is no god but He;
<br> He brings to life and causes to die  therefore believe in Allah and His apostle,
<br> the Ummi Prophet  who believes in Allah and His words,
<br> and follow him so that you  may walk in the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_157"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.159</b>]
<br>
<br> And of Musa's people was a party who guided (people)  with the truth,
<br> and thereby did they do justice.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_158"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.160</b>]
<br>
<br> And We divided them into twelve tribes,
<br> as nations;
<br> and  We revealed to Musa when his people asked him for water:
<br>  Strike the rock with your staff,
<br> so outnowed from it twelve  springs;
<br> each tribe knew its drinking place;
<br> and We made the  clouds to give shade over them and We sent to them manna and  quails:
<br> Eat of the good things We have given you.
<br> And they did  not do Us any harm,
<br> but they did injustice to their own souls.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_159"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.161</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it was said to them:
<br> Reside in this town and  eat from it wherever you wish,
<br> and say,
<br> Put down from us our  heavy burdens:
<br> and enter the gate making obeisance,
<br> We will  forgive you your wrongs:
<br> We will give more to those who do  good (to others).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_160"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.162</b>]
<br>
<br> But those who were unjust among them changed it for a  saying other than that which had been spoken to them;
<br> so We  sent upon them a pestilence from heaven because they were  unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_161"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.163</b>]
<br>
<br> And ask them about the town which stood by the sea;
<br>  when they exceeded the limits of the Sabbath,
<br> when their fish  came to them on the day of their Sabbath,
<br> appearing on the  surface of the water,
<br> and on the day on which they did not keep  the Sabbath they did not come to them;
<br> thus did We try them  because they transgressed.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_162"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.164</b>]
<br>
<br> And when a party of them said:
<br> Why do you admonish a  with a severe chastisement?
<br> They said:
<br> To be free from blame  before your Lord,
<br> and that haply they may guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_163"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.165</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they neglected what they had been reminded of,
<br>  We delivered those who forbade evil and We overtook those  who were unjust with an evil chastisement because they transgressed.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_164"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.166</b>]
<br>
<br>  Therefore when they revoltingly persisted in what they  had been forbidden,
<br> We said to them:
<br> Be (as) apes,
<br> despised and  hated.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_165"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.167</b>]
<br>
<br> And when your Lord announced that He would certainly  send against them to the day of resurrection those who would  subject them to severe torment;
<br> most surely your Lord is quick  to requite (evil) and most surely He is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_166"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.168</b>]
<br>
<br> And We cut them up on the earth into parties,
<br> (some) of  them being righteous and (others) of them falling short of that,
<br>  and We tried them with blessings and misfortunes that they  might turn.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_167"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.169</b>]
<br>
<br> Then there came after them an evil posterity who inherited  the Book,
<br> taking only the frail good of this low life and  saying:
<br> It will be forgiven us.
<br> And if the like good came to them,
<br>  they would take it (too).
<br> Was not a promise taken from them in  the Book that they would not speak anything about Allah but  the truth,
<br> and they have read what is in it;
<br> and the abode of the  hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil).
<br> Do you not  then understand?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_168"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.170</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who hold fast by the Book and keep  up prayer,
<br> surely We do not waste the reward of the right doers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_169"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.171</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We shook the mountain over them as if it  were a covering overhead,
<br> and they thought that it was going to  fall down upon them:
<br> Take hold of what We have given you with  firmness,
<br> and be mindful of what is in it,
<br> so that you may guard  (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_170"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.172</b>]
<br>
<br> And when your Lord brought forth from the children of  Adam,
<br> from their backs,
<br> their descendants,
<br> and made them bear  witness against their own souls:
<br> Am I not your Lord?
<br> They said:
<br>  Yes!
<br> we bear witness.
<br> Lest you should say on the day of resurrection:
<br>  Surely we were heedless of this.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_171"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.173</b>]
<br>
<br> Or you should say:
<br> Only our fathers associated others  (with Allah) before,
<br> and we were an offspring after them:
<br> Wilt  Thou then destroy us for what the vain doers did?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_172"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.174</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus do We make clear the communications,
<br> and  that haply they might return.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_173"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.175</b>]
<br>
<br> And recite to them the narrative of him to whom We give  Our communications,
<br> but he withdraws himself from them,
<br> so  the Shaitan overtakes him,
<br> so he is of those who go astray.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_174"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.176</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We had pleased,
<br> We would certainly have exalted  him thereby;
<br> but he clung to the earth and followed his low  desire,
<br> so his parable is as the parable of the dog;
<br> if you attack  him he lolls out his tongue;
<br> and if you leave him alone he lolls  out his tongue;
<br> this is the parable of the people who reject Our  communications;
<br> therefore relate the narrative that they may  reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_175"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.177</b>]
<br>
<br> Evil is the likeness of the people who reject Our communications  and are unjust to their own souls.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_176"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.178</b>]
<br>
<br> Whomsoever Allah guides,
<br> he is the one who follows the  right way;
<br> and whomsoever He causes to err,
<br> these are the losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_177"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.179</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have created for hell many of the jinn  and the men;
<br> they have hearts with which they do not understand,
<br>  and they have eyes with which they do not see,
<br> and they  have ears with which they do not hear;
<br> they are as cattle,
<br> nay,
<br>  they are in worse errors;
<br> these are the heedless ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_178"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.180</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's are the best names,
<br> therefore call on Him  thereby,
<br> and leave alone those who violate the sanctity of His  names;
<br> they shall be recompensed for what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_179"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.181</b>]
<br>
<br> And of those whom We have created are a people who  guide with the truth and thereby they do justice.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_180"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.182</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as to) those who reject Our communications,
<br> We  draw them near (to destruction) by degrees from whence they  know not.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_181"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.183</b>]
<br>
<br> And I grant them respite;
<br> surely My scheme is effective.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_182"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.184</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not reflect that their companion has not unsoundness  in mind;
<br> he is only a plain warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_183"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.185</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not consider the kingdom of the heavens and the  earth and whatever things Allah has created,
<br> and that may be  their doom shall have drawn nigh;
<br> what announcement would  they then believe in after this?
<br>
<a name = "verse7_184"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.186</b>]
<br>
<br> Whomsoever Allah causes to err,
<br> there is no guide for  him;
<br> and He leaves them alone in their inordinacy,
<br> blindly  wandering on.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_185"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.187</b>]
<br>
<br> They ask you about the hour,
<br> when will be its taking  place?
<br> Say:
<br> The knowledge of it is only with my Lord;
<br> none but  He shall manifest it at its time;
<br> it will be momentous in the  heavens and the earth;
<br> it will not come on you but of a sudden.
<br>  They ask you as if you were solicitous about it.
<br> Say:
<br> Its knowledge  is only with Allah,
<br> but most people do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_186"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.188</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I do not control any benefit or harm for my own  soul except as Allah please;
<br> and had I known the unseen I would  have had much of good and no evil would have touched me;
<br> I  am nothing but a warner and the giver of good news to a people  who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_187"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.189</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who created you from a single being,
<br> and of the  same (kind) did He make his mate,
<br> that he might incline to her;
<br>  so when he covers her she bears a light burden,
<br> then moves about with  it;
<br> but when it grows heavy,
<br> they both call upon  Allah,
<br> their Lord:
<br> If Thou givest us a good one,
<br> we shall certainly  be of the grateful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_188"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.190</b>]
<br>
<br> But when He gives them a good one,
<br> thcy set up with  Him associates in what He has given them;
<br> but high is Allah  above what they associate (with Him).
<br>
<a name = "verse7_189"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.191</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> they associate (with Him) that which does not  create any thing,
<br> while they are themselves created!
<br>
<a name = "verse7_190"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.192</b>]
<br>
<br> And they have no power to give them help,
<br> nor can they  help themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_191"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.193</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you invite them to guidance,
<br> they will not follow  you;
<br> it is the same to you whether you invite them or you are  silent.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_192"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.194</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those whom you call on besides Allah are in a  state of subjugation like yourselves;
<br> therefore call on them,
<br> then  let them answer you if you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_193"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.195</b>]
<br>
<br> Have they feet with which they walk,
<br> or have they hands  with which they hold,
<br> or have they eyes with which they see,
<br> or  have they ears with which they hear?
<br> Say:
<br> Call your associates,
<br>  then make a struggle (to prevail) against me and give me no  respite.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_194"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.196</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely my guardian is Allah,
<br> Who revealed the Book,
<br>  and He befriends the good.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_195"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.197</b>]

<br> And those whom you call upon besides Him are not able  to help you,
<br> nor can they help themselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_196"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.198</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you invite them to guidance,
<br> they do not hear;
<br>  and you see them looking towards you,
<br> yet they do not see.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_197"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.199</b>]
<br>
<br> Take to forgiveness and enjoin good and turn aside from  the ignorant.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_198"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.200</b>]
<br>
<br> And if a false imputation from the Shaitan afflict you,
<br>  seek refuge in Allah;
<br> surely He is Hearing,
<br> Knowing.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_199"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.201</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who guard (against evil),
<br> when a visitation  from the Shaitan afflicts them they become mindful,
<br> then lo!
<br>  they see.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_200"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.202</b>]
<br>
<br> And their brethren increase them in error,
<br> then they  cease not.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_201"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.203</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you bring them not a revelation they say:
<br> Why  do you not forge it?
<br> Say:
<br> I only follow what is revealed to me  from my Lord;
<br> these are clear proofs from your Lord and a  guidance and a mercy for a people who believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_202"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.204</b>]
<br>
<br> And when the Quran is recited,
<br> then listen to it and  remain silent,
<br> that mercy may be shown to you.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_203"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.205</b>]
<br>
<br> And remember your Lord within yourself humbly and  fearing and in a voice not loud in the morning and the evening  and be not of the heedless ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse7_204"></a>
<p>
[<b>7.206</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who are with your Lord are not too proud  to serve Him,
<br> and they declare His glory and throw themselves  down in humility before Him.
