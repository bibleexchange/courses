<p><h3>Book 17</h3>
<br><h3>The Children of Israel</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse17_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Glory be to Him Who made His servant to go on a night  from the Sacred Mosque to the remote mosque of which We have  blessed the precincts,
<br> so that We may show to him some of  Our signs;
<br> surely He is the Hearing,
<br> the Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave Musa the Book and made it a guidance to the  children of Israel,
<br> saying:
<br> Do not take a protector besides  Me;
<br>
<a name = "verse17_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.3</b>]
<br>
<br> The offspring of those whom We bore with Nuh;
<br> surely he  was a grateful servant.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And We had made known to the children of Israel in the  Book:
<br> Most certainly you will make mischief in the land  twice,
<br> and most certainly you will behave insolently with  great insolence.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.5</b>]
<br>
<br> So when the promise for the first of the two came,
<br> We  sent over you Our servants,
<br> of mighty prowess,
<br> so they went  to and fro among the houses,
<br> and it was a promise to be  accomplished.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We gave you back the turn to prevail against them,
<br>  and aided you with wealth and children and made you a  numerous band.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.7</b>]
<br>
<br> If you do good,
<br> you will do good for your own souls,
<br> and  if you do evil,
<br> it shall be for them.
<br> So when the second  promise came (We raised another people) that they may bring  you to grief and that they may enter the mosque as they  entered it the first time,
<br> and that they might destroy  whatever they gained ascendancy over with utter destruction.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.8</b>]
<br>
<br> It may be that your Lord will have mercy on you,
<br> and if  you again return (to disobedience) We too will return (to  punishment),
<br> and We have made hell a prison for the  unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely this Quran guides to that which is most upright  and gives good news to the believers who do good that they  shall have a great reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And that (as for) those who do not believe in the  hereafter,
<br> We have prepared for them a painful chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good,
<br> and  man is ever hasty.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have made the night and the day two signs,
<br> then  We have made the sign of the night to pass away and We have  made the sign of the day manifest,
<br> so that you may seek  grace from your Lord,
<br> and that you might know the numbering  of years and the reckoning;
<br> and We have explained everything  with distinctness.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have made every man's actions to cling to his  neck,
<br> and We will bring forth to him on the resurrection day  a book which he will find wide open:
<br>
<a name = "verse17_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Read your book;
<br> your own self is sufficient as a  reckoner against you this day.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever goes aright,
<br> for his own soul does he go aright;
<br>  and whoever goes astray,
<br> to its detriment only does he go  astray:
<br> nor can the bearer of a burden bear the burden of  another,
<br> nor do We chastise until We raise an apostle.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We wish to destroy a town,
<br> We send Our  commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives,
<br> but  they transgress therein;
<br> thus the word proves true against  it,
<br> so We destroy it with utter destruction.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many of the generations did We destroy after  Nuh!
<br> and your Lord is sufficient as Knowing and Seeing with  regard to His servants' faults.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever desires this present life,
<br> We hasten to him  therein what We please for whomsoever We desire,
<br> then We  assign to him the hell;
<br> he shall enter it despised,
<br> driven  away.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever desires the hereafter and strives for it as  he ought to strive and he is a believer;
<br> (as for) these,
<br>  their striving shall surely be accepted.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.20</b>]
<br>
<br> All do We aid-- these as well as those-- out of the bounty  of your Lord,
<br> and the bounty of your Lord is not confined.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.21</b>]
<br>
<br> See how We have made some of them to excel others,
<br> and  certainly the hereafter is much superior in respect of  excellence.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Do not associate with Allah any other god,
<br> lest you sit  down despised,
<br> neglected.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord has commanded that you shall not serve  (any) but Him,
<br> and goodness to your parents.
<br> If either or  both of them reach old age with you,
<br> say not to them (so  much as) "Ugh" nor chide them,
<br> and speak to them a generous  word.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And make yourself submissively gentle to them with  compassion,
<br> and say:
<br> O my Lord!
<br> have compassion on them,
<br> as  they brought me up (when I was) little.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Your Lord knows best what is in your minds;
<br> if you are  good,
<br> then He is surely Forgiving to those who turn (to Him)  frequently.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And give to the near of kin his due and (to) the needy  and the wayfarer,
<br> and do not squander wastefully.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the squanderers are the fellows of the Shaitans  and the Shaitan is ever ungrateful to his Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And if you turn away from them to seek mercy from your  Lord,
<br> which you hope for,
<br> speak to them a gentle word.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not make your hand to be shackled to your neck  nor stretch it forth to the utmost (limit) of its stretching  forth,
<br> lest you should (afterwards) sit down blamed,
<br>  stripped off.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely your Lord makes plentiful the means of  subsistence for whom He pleases and He straitens (them);
<br>  surely He is ever Aware of,
<br> Seeing,
<br> His servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not kill your children for fear of poverty;
<br> We  give them sustenance and yourselves (too);
<br> surely to kill  them is a great wrong.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And go not nigh to fornication;
<br> surely it is an  indecency and an evil way.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not kill any one whom Allah has forbidden,
<br> except  for a just cause,
<br> and whoever is slain unjustly,
<br> We have  indeed given to his heir authority,
<br> so let him not exceed  the just limits in slaying;
<br> surely he is aided.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And draw not near to the property of the orphan except  in a goodly way till he attains his maturity and fulfill the  promise;
<br> surely (every) promise shall be questioned about.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.35</b>]
<br>
<br> And give full measure when you measure out,
<br> and weigh  with a true balance;
<br> this is fair and better in the end.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And follow not that of which you have not the knowledge;
<br>  surely the hearing and the sight and the heart,
<br> all of  these,
<br> shall be questioned about that.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And do not go about in the land exultingly,
<br> for you  cannot cut through the earth nor reach the mountains in  height.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.38</b>]
<br>
<br> All this-- the evil of it-- is hateful in the sight of your  Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.39</b>]
<br>
<br> This is of what your Lord has revealed to you of wisdom,
<br>  and do not associate any other god with Allah lest you  should be thrown into hell,
<br> blamed,
<br> cast away.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.40</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> has then your Lord preferred to give you sons,
<br> and  (for Himself) taken daughters from among the angels?
<br> Most  surely you utter a grievous saying.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have repeated (warnings) in this Quran  that they may be mindful,
<br> but it does not add save to their  aversion.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.42</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If there were with Him gods as they say,
<br> then  certainly they would have been able to seek a way to the  Lord of power.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Glory be to Him and exalted be He in high exaltation  above what they say.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.44</b>]
<br>
<br> The seven heavens declare His glory and the earth (too),
<br>  and those who are in them;
<br> and there is not a single thing  but glorifies Him with His praise,
<br> but you do not understand  their glorification;
<br> surely He is Forbearing,
<br> Forgiving.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you recite the Quran,
<br> We place between you and  those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden barrier;
<br>
<a name = "verse17_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.46</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have placed coverings on their hearts and a  heaviness in their ears lest they understand it,
<br> and when  you mention your Lord alone in the Quran they turn their  backs in aversion.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.47</b>]
<br>
<br> We know best what they listen to when they listen to  you,
<br> and when they take counsel secretly,
<br> when the unjust  say:
<br> You follow only a man deprived of reason.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.48</b>]
<br>
<br> See what they liken you to!
<br> So they have gone astray and  cannot find the way.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> What!
<br> when we shall have become bones and  decayed particles,
<br> shall we then certainly be raised up,
<br>  being a new creation?
<br>
<a name = "verse17_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Become stones or iron,
<br>
<a name = "verse17_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.51</b>]
<br>
<br> Or some other creature of those which are too hard (to  receive life) in your minds!
<br> But they will say:
<br> Who will  return us?
<br> Say:
<br> Who created you at first.
<br> Still they will  shake their heads at you and say:
<br> When will it be?
<br> Say:
<br>  Maybe it has drawn nigh.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.52</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when He will call you forth,
<br> then shall you  obey Him,
<br> giving Him praise,
<br> and you will think that you  tarried but a little (while).
<br>
<a name = "verse17_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And say to My servants (that) they speak that which is  best;
<br> surely the Shaitan sows dissensions among them;
<br> surely  the Shaitan is an open enemy to man.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.54</b>]
<br>
<br> Your Lord knows you best;
<br> He will have mercy on you if  He pleases,
<br> or He will chastise you if He pleases;
<br> and We  have not sent you as being in charge of them.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.55</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord best knows those who are in the heavens and  the earth;
<br> and certainly We have made some of the prophets to excel  others,
<br> and to Dawood We gave a scripture.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Call on those whom you assert besides Him,
<br> so they  shall not control the removal of distress from you nor (its)  transference.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Those whom they call upon,
<br> themselves seek the means of  access to their Lord-- whoever of them is nearest-- and they  hope for His mercy and fear His chastisement;
<br> surely the  chastisement of your Lord is a thing to be cautious of.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And there is not a town but We will destroy it before  the day of resurrection or chastise it with a severe  chastisement;
<br> this is written in the Divine ordinance.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.59</b>]
<br>
<br> And nothing could have hindered Us that We should send  signs except that the ancients rejected them;
<br> and We gave to  Samood the she-camel-- a manifest sign-- but on her account they  did injustice,
<br> and We do not send signs but to make (men)  fear.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We said to you:
<br> Surely your Lord encompasses  men;
<br> and We did not make the vision which We showed you but  a trial for men and the cursed tree in the Quran as well;
<br>  and We cause them to fear,
<br> but it only adds to their great  inordinacy.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.61</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We said to the angels:
<br> Make obeisance to Adam;
<br>  they made obeisance,
<br> but Iblis (did it not).
<br> He said:
<br> Shall  I make obeisance to him whom Thou hast created of dust?
<br>
<a name = "verse17_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.62</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Tell me,
<br> is this he whom Thou hast honored  above me?
<br> If Thou shouldst respite me to the day of  resurrection,
<br> I will most certainly cause his progeny to  perish except a few.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.63</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Be gone!
<br> for whoever of them will follow you,
<br>  then surely hell is your recompense,
<br> a full recompense:
<br>
<a name = "verse17_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.64</b>]
<br>
<br> And beguile whomsoever of them you can with your voice,
<br>  and collect against them your forces riding and on foot,
<br> and  share with them in wealth and children,
<br> and hold out  promises to them;
<br> and the Shaitan makes not promises to them  but to deceive:
<br>
<a name = "verse17_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.65</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) My servants,
<br> you have no authority over  them;
<br> and your Lord is sufficient as a Protector.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Your Lord is He Who speeds the ships for you in the sea  that you may seek of His grace;
<br> surely He is ever Merciful  to you.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.67</b>]
<br>
<br> And when distress afflicts you in the sea,
<br> away go those  whom you call on except He;
<br> but when He brings you safe to  the land,
<br> you turn aside;
<br> and man is ever ungrateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.68</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a  tract of land to engulf you or send on you a tornado?
<br> Then  you shall not find a protector for yourselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Or,
<br> do you feel secure that He will (not) take you back  into it another time,
<br> then send on you a fierce gale and  thus drown you on account of your ungratefulness?
<br> Then you  shall not find any aider against Us in the matter.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.70</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely We have honored the children of Adam,
<br> and We  carry them in the land and the sea,
<br> and We have given them  of the good things,
<br> and We have made them to excel by an  appropriate excellence over most of those whom We have  created.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.71</b>]
<br>
<br> (Remember) the day when We will call every people with  their Imam;
<br> then whoever is given his book in his right  hand,
<br> these shall read their book;
<br> and they shall not be  dealt with a whit unjustly.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.72</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever is blind in this,
<br> he shall (also) be blind  in the hereafter;
<br> and more erring from the way.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.73</b>]
<br>
<br> And surely they had purposed to turn you away from that  which We have revealed to you,
<br> that you should forge against  Us other than that,
<br> and then they would certainly have taken  you for a friend.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.74</b>]
<br>
<br> And had it not been that We had already established you,
<br>  you would certainly have been near to incline to them a  little;
<br>
<a name = "verse17_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.75</b>]
<br>
<br> In that case We would certainly have made you to taste a  double (punishment) in this life and a double (punishment)  after death,
<br> then you would not have found any helper  against Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.76</b>]
<br>
<br> And.
<br>surely they purposed to unsettle you from the land  that they might expel you from it,
<br> and in that case they  will not tarry behind you but a little.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.77</b>]
<br>
<br> (This is Our) course with regard to those of Our  apostles whom We sent before you,
<br> and you shall not find a  change in Our course.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.78</b>]
<br>
<br> Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the  darkness of the night and the morning recitation;
<br> surely the  morning recitation is witnessed.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_79"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.79</b>]
<br>
<br> And during a part of the night,
<br> pray Tahajjud beyond  what is incumbent on you;
<br> maybe your Lord will raise you to  a position of great glory.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_80"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And say:
<br> My Lord!
<br> make me to enter a goodly entering,
<br>  and cause me to go forth a goodly going forth,
<br> and grant me  from near Thee power to assist (me).
<br>
<a name = "verse17_81"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.81</b>]
<br>
<br> And say:
<br> The truth has come and the falsehood has  vanished;
<br> surely falsehood is a vanishing (thing).
<br>
<a name = "verse17_82"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.82</b>]
<br>
<br> And We reveal of the Quran that which is a healing and a  mercy to the believers,
<br> and it adds only to the perdition of  the unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_83"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.83</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We bestow favor on man,
<br> he turns aside and  behaves proudly,
<br> and when evil afflicts him,
<br> he is  despairing.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_84"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.84</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Every one acts according to his manner;
<br> but your  Lord best knows who is best guided in the path.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_85"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.85</b>]
<br>
<br> And they ask you about the soul.
<br> Say:
<br> The soul is one of  the commands of my Lord,
<br> and you are not given aught of  knowledge but a little.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_86"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.86</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We please,
<br> We should certainly take away that  which We have revealed to you,
<br> then you would not find for  it any protector against Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_87"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.87</b>]
<br>
<br> But on account of mercy from your Lord-- surely His grace  to you is abundant.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_88"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.88</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If men and jinn should combine together to bring  the like of this Quran,
<br> they could not bring the like of it,
<br>  though some of them were aiders of others.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_89"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.89</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We have explained for men in this Quran  every kind of similitude,
<br> but most men do not consent to  aught but denying.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_90"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.90</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> We will by no means believe in you until  you cause a fountain to gush forth from the earth for us.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_91"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.91</b>]
<br>
<br> Or you should have a garden of palms and grapes in the  midst of which you should cause rivers to flow forth,
<br>  gushing out.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_92"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.92</b>]
<br>
<br> Or you should cause the heaven to come down upon us in  pieces as you think,
<br> or bring Allah and the angels face to  face (with us).
<br>
<a name = "verse17_93"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.93</b>]
<br>
<br> Or you should have a house of gold,
<br> or you should ascend  into heaven,
<br> and we will not believe in your ascending until  you bring down to us a book which we may read.
<br> Say:
<br> Glory be  to my Lord;
<br> am I aught but a mortal apostle?
<br>
<a name = "verse17_94"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.94</b>]
<br>
<br> And nothing prevented people from believing when the  guidance came to them except that they said:
<br> What!
<br> has Allah  raised up a mortal to be an apostle?
<br>
<a name = "verse17_95"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.95</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Had there been in the earth angels walking about as  settlers,
<br> We would certainly have sent down to them from the  heaven an angel as an apostle.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_96"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.96</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Allah suffices as a witness between me and you;
<br>  surely He is Aware of His servants,
<br> Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_97"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.97</b>]
<br>
<br> And whomsoever Allah guides,
<br> he is the follower of the  right way,
<br> and whomsoever He causes to err,
<br> you shall not  find for him guardians besides Him;
<br> and We will gather them  together on the day of resurrection on their faces,
<br> blind  and dumb and deaf;
<br> their abode is hell;
<br> whenever it becomes  allayed We will add to their burning.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_98"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.98</b>]
<br>
<br> This is their retribution because they disbelieved in  Our communications and said What!
<br> when we shall have become  bones and decayed particles,
<br> shall we then indeed be raised  up into a new creation?
<br>
<a name = "verse17_99"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.99</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not consider that Allah,
<br> Who created the heavens  and the earth,
<br> is able to create their like,
<br> and He has  appointed for them a doom about which there is no doubt?
<br> But  the unjust do not consent to aught but denying.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_100"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.100</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> If you control the treasures of the mercy of my  Lord,
<br> then you would withhold (them) from fear of spending,
<br>  and man is niggardly.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_101"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.101</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave Musa nine clear signs;
<br> so ask the  children of Israel.
<br> When he came to them,
<br> Firon said to him:
<br>  Most surely I deem you,
<br> O Musa,
<br> to be a man deprived of  reason.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_102"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.102</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> Truly you know that none but the Lord of the  heavens and the earth has sent down these as clear proof and  most surely I believe you,
<br> O Firon,
<br> to be given over to  perdition.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_103"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.103</b>]
<br>
<br> So he desired to destroy them out of the earth,
<br> but We  drowned him and those with him all together;
<br>
<a name = "verse17_104"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.104</b>]
<br>
<br> And We said to the Israelites after him:
<br> Dwell in the  land:
<br> and when the promise of the next life shall come to  pass,
<br> we will bring you both together in judgment.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_105"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.105</b>]
<br>
<br> And with truth have We revealed it,
<br> and with truth did  it come;
<br> and We have not sent you but as the giver of good  news and as a warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_106"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.106</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is a Quran which We have revealed in portions so  that you may read it to the people by slow degrees,
<br> and We  have revealed it,
<br> revealing in portions.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_107"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.107</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Believe in it or believe not;
<br> surely those who are  given the knowledge before it fall down on their faces,
<br>  making obeisance when it is recited to them.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_108"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.108</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> Glory be to our Lord!
<br> most surely the  promise of our Lord was to be fulfilled.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_109"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.109</b>]
<br>
<br> And they fall down on their faces weeping,
<br> and it adds  to their humility.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_110"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.110</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Call upon Allah or call upon,
<br> the Beneficent God;
<br>  whichever you call upon,
<br> He has the best names;
<br> and do not  utter your prayer with a very raised voice nor be silent  with regard to it,
<br> and seek a way between these.
<br>
<a name = "verse17_111"></a>
<p>
[<b>17.111</b>]
<br>
<br> And say:
<br> (All) praise is due to Allah,
<br> Who has not  taken a son and Who has not a partner in the kingdom,
<br> and  Who has not a helper to save Him from disgrace;
<br> and proclaim  His greatness magnifying (Him).
