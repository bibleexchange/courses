<p><h3>Book 45</h3>
<br><h3>The Kneeling</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse45_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ha Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.2</b>]
<br>
<br> The revelation of the Book is from Allah,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the  Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely in the heavens and the earth there are signs  for the believers.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And in your (own) creation and in what He spreads abroad  of animals there are signs for a people that are sure;
<br>
<a name = "verse45_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And (in) the variation of the night and the day,
<br> and (in)  what Allah sends down of sustenance from the cloud,
<br> then  gives life thereby to the earth after its death,
<br> and (in)  the changing of the winds,
<br> there are signs for a people who  understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.6</b>]
<br>
<br> These are the communications of Allah which We recite to  you with truth;
<br> then in what announcement would they believe  after Allah and His communications?
<br>
<a name = "verse45_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Woe to every sinful liar,
<br>
<a name = "verse45_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Who hears the communications of Allah recited to him,
<br>  then persists proudly as though he had not heard them;
<br> so  announce to him a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And when he comes to know of any of Our communications,
<br>  he takes it for a jest;
<br> these it is that shall have abasing  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Before them is hell,
<br> and there shall not avail them  aught of what they earned,
<br> nor those whom they took for  guardians besides Allah,
<br> and they shall have a grievous  punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.11</b>]
<br>
<br> This is guidance;
<br> and (as for) those who disbelieve in  the communications of their Lord,
<br> they shall have a painful  punishment on account of uncleanness.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is He Who made subservient to you the sea that the  ships may run therein by His command,
<br> and that you may seek  of His grace,
<br> and that you may give thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And He has made subservient to you whatsoever is in the  heavens and whatsoever is in the earth,
<br> all,
<br> from Himself;
<br>  most surely there are signs in this for a people who  reflect.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Say to those who believe (that) they forgive those who  do not fear the days of Allah that He may reward a people  for what they earn.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever does good,
<br> it is for his own soul,
<br> and whoever  does evil,
<br> it is against himself;
<br> then you shall be brought  back to your-- Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave the Book and the wisdom and the  prophecy to the children of Israel,
<br> and We gave them of the  goodly things,
<br> and We made them excel the nations.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And We gave them clear arguments in the affair,
<br> but they  did not differ until after knowledge had come to them out of  envy among themselves;
<br> surely your -Lord will judge between  them on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein they  differed.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We have made you follow a course in the affair,
<br>  therefore follow it,
<br> and do not follow the low desires of  those who do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they shall not avail you in the least against  Allah;
<br> and surely the unjust are friends of each other,
<br> and  Allah is the guardian of those who guard (against evil).
<br>
<a name = "verse45_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.20</b>]
<br>
<br> These are clear proofs for men,
<br> and a guidance and a  mercy for a people who are sure.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> do those who have wrought evil deeds think that We  will make them like those who believe and do good-- that their  life and their death shall be equal?
<br> Evil it is that they  judge.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth  and that every soul may be rewarded for what it has earned  and they shall not be wronged.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you then considered him who takes his low desire  for his god,
<br> and Allah has made him err having knowledge and  has set a seal upon his ear and his heart and put a covering  upon his eye.
<br> Who can then guide him after Allah?
<br> Will you  not then be mindful?
<br>
<a name = "verse45_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> There is nothing but our life in this  world;
<br> we live and die and nothing destroys us but time,
<br> and  they have no knowledge of that;
<br> they only conjecture.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our clear communications are recited to them,
<br>  their argument is no other than that they say:
<br> Bring our  fathers (back) if you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Allah gives you life,
<br> then He makes you die,
<br> then  will He gather you to the day of resurrection wherein is no  doubt,
<br> but most people do not know.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth;
<br>  and on the day when the hour shall come to pass,
<br> on that day  shall they perish who say false things.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And you shall see every nation kneeling down;
<br> every  nation shall be called to its book:
<br> today you shall be  rewarded for what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.29</b>]
<br>
<br> This is Our book that speaks against you with justice;
<br>  surely We wrote what you did,
<br>
<a name = "verse45_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Then as to those who believed and did good,
<br> their Lord  will make them enter into His mercy;
<br> that is the manifest  achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.31</b>]
<br>
<br> As to those who disbelieved:
<br> What!
<br> were not My  communications recited to you?
<br> But you were proud and you  were a guilty people.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And when it was said,
<br> Surely the promise of Allah is  true and as for the hour,
<br> there is no doubt about it,
<br> you  said:
<br> We do not know what the hour is;
<br> we do not think (that  it will come to pass) save a passing thought,
<br> and we are not  at all sure.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.33</b>]
<br>
<br> And the evil (consequences) of what they did shall  become manifest to them and that which they mocked shall  encompass them.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And it shall be said:
<br> Today We forsake you as you  neglected the meeting of this day of yours and your abode is  the fire,
<br> and there are not for you any helpers:
<br>
<a name = "verse45_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.35</b>]
<br>
<br> That is because you took the communications of Allah for  a jest and the life of this world deceived you.
<br> So on that  day they shall not be brought forth from it,
<br> nor shall they  be granted goodwill.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.36</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore to Allah is due (all) praise,
<br> the Lord of the  heavens and the Lord of the earth,
<br> the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse45_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>45.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And to Him belongs greatness in the heavens and the  earth,
<br> and He is the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
