<p><h3>Book 35</h3>
<br><h3>The Originator</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse35_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.1</b>]
<br>
<br> All praise is due to Allah,
<br> the Originator of the heavens  and the earth,
<br> the Maker of the angels,
<br> messengers flying on  wings,
<br> two,
<br> and three,
<br> and four;
<br> He increases in creation  what He pleases;
<br> surely Allah has power over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Whatever Allah grants to men of (His) mercy,
<br> there is  none to withhold it,
<br> and what He withholds there is none to  send it forth after that,
<br> and He is the Mighty,
 the Wise<br>
<a name = "verse35_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.3</b>]
<br>
<br> O men!
<br> call to mind the favor of Allah on you;
<br> is there  any creator besides Allah who gives you sustenance from the  heaven and the earth?
<br> There is no god but He;
<br> whence are you  then turned away?
<br>
<a name = "verse35_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they call you a liar,
<br> truly apostles before you  were called liars,
<br> and to Allah are all affairs returned.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.5</b>]
<br>
<br> O men!
<br> surely the promise of Allah is true,
<br> therefore let  not the life of this world deceive you,
<br> and let not the  archdeceiver deceive you respecting Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely the Shaitan is your enemy,
<br> so take him for an  enemy;
<br> he only invites his party that they may be inmates of  the burning    7 (As for) those who disbelieve,
<br> they shall have a severe  punishment,
<br> and (as for) those who believe and do good,
<br> they  shall have forgiveness and a great reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.8</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> is he whose evil deed is made fairseeming to him so  much so that he considers it good?
<br> Now surely Allah makes  err whom He pleases and guides aright whom He pleases,
<br> so  let not your soul waste away in grief for them;
 surely Allah  is Cognizant of what they do<br>
<a name = "verse35_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah is He Who sends the winds so they raise a  cloud,
<br> then We drive it on to a dead country,
<br> and therewith  We give life to the earth after its death;
<br> even so is the  quickening.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever desires honor,
<br> then to Allah belongs the honor  wholly.
<br> To Him do ascend the good words;
<br> and the good deeds,
<br>  lift them up,
<br> and (as for) those who plan evil deeds,
<br> they  shall have a severe chastisement;
<br> and (as for) their plan,
<br>  it shall perish.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah created you of dust,
<br> then of the life-germ,
<br>  then He made you pairs;
<br> and no female bears,
<br> nor does she  bring forth,
<br> except with His knowledge;
<br> and no one whose  life is lengthened has his life lengthened,
<br> nor is aught  diminished of one's life,
<br> but it is all in a book;
<br> surely  this is easy to Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And the two seas are not alike:
<br> the one sweet,
<br> that  subdues thirst by its excessive sweetness,
<br> pleasant to  drink;
<br> and the other salt,
<br> that burns by its saltness;
<br> yet  from each of them you eat fresh flesh and bring forth  ornaments which you wear;
<br> and you see the ships cleave  through it that you may seek of His bounty and that you may  be grateful.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.13</b>]
<br>
<br> He causes the night to enter in upon the day,
<br> and He  causes the day to enter in upon the night,
<br> and He has made  subservient (to you) the sun and the moon;
<br> each one follows  its course to an appointed time;
<br> this is Allah,
<br> your Lord,
<br>  His is the kingdom;
<br> and those whom you call upon besides Him  do not control a straw.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.14</b>]
<br>
<br> If you call on them they shall not hear your call,
<br> and  even if they could hear they shall not answer you;
<br> and on  the resurrection day they will deny your associating them  (with Allah);
<br> and none can inform you like the One Who is  Aware.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.15</b>]
<br>
<br> O men!
<br> you are they who stand in need of Allah,
<br> and  Allah is He Who is the Self-sufficient,
<br> the Praised One.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.16</b>]
<br>
<br> If He please,
<br> He will take you off and bring a new  generation.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And this is not hard to Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And a burdened soul cannot bear the burden of another  and if one weighed down by burden should cry for (another to  carry) its burden,
<br> not aught of it shall be carried,
<br> even  though he be near of kin.
<br> You warn only those who fear their  Lord in secret and keep up prayer;
<br> and whoever purifies  himself,
<br> he purifies himself only for (the good of) his own  soul;
<br> and to Allah is the eventual coming.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.19</b>]
<br>
 And the blind and the seeing are not alike<br>
<a name = "verse35_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor the darkness and the light,
<br>
<a name = "verse35_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Nor the shade and the heat,
<br>
<a name = "verse35_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Neither are the living and the dead alike.
<br> Surely Allah  makes whom He pleases hear,
<br> and you cannot make those hear  who are m the graves.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.23</b>]
<br>
<br> You are naught but a warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of  good news and a warner;
<br> and there is not a people but a  warner has gone among them.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And if they call you a liar,
<br> so did those before them  indeed call (their apostles) liars;
<br> their apostles had come  to them with clear arguments,
<br> and with scriptures,
<br> and with  the illuminating book.
<br>    26 Then did I punish those who disbelieved,
<br> so how was the  manifestation of My disapproval?
<br>
<a name = "verse35_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the  cloud,
<br> then We bring forth therewith fruits of various  colors;
<br> and in the mountains are streaks,
<br> white and red,
<br> of  various hues and (others) intensely black?
<br>
<a name = "verse35_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And of men and beasts and cattle are various species of  it likewise;
<br> those of His servants only who are possessed of  knowledge fear Allah;
<br> surely Allah is Mighty,
<br> Forgiving.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely they who recite the Book of Allah and keep up  prayer and spend out of what We have given them secretly and  openly,
<br> hope for a gain which will not perish.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.30</b>]
<br>
<br> That He may pay them back fully their rewards and give  them more out of His grace:
<br> surely He is Forgiving,
<br>  Multiplier of rewards.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And that which We have revealed to you of the Book,
<br> that  is the truth verifying that which is before it;
<br> most surely  with respect to His servants Allah is Aware,
<br> Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom  We chose from among Our servants;
<br> but of them is he who  makes his soul to suffer a loss,
<br> and of them is he who takes  a middle course,
<br> and of them is he who is foremost in deeds  of goodness by Allah's permission;
<br> this is the great  excellence.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Gardens of perpetuity,
<br> they shall enter therein;
<br> they  shad be made to wear therein bracelets of gold and pearls,
<br>  and their dress therein shall be silk.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall say:
<br> (All) praise is due to Allah,
<br> Who  has made grief to depart from us;
<br> most surely our Lord is  Forgiving,
<br> Multiplier of rewards,
<br>
<a name = "verse35_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Who has made us alight in a house abiding for ever out  of .
<br> His grace;
<br> toil shall not touch us therein,
<br> nor shall  fatigue therein afflict us.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who disbelieve,
<br> for them is the fire  of hell;
<br> it shall not be finished with them entirely so that  they should die,
<br> nor shall the chastisement thereof be  lightened to them:
<br> even thus do We retribute every  ungrateful one.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.37</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall cry therein for succour:
<br> O our Lord !
<br>  take us out,
<br> we will do good deeds other than those which we  used to do.
<br> Did We not preserve you alive long enough,
<br> so  that he who would be mindful in it should mind?
<br> And there  came to you the warner;
<br> therefore taste;
<br> because for the  unjust,
<br> there 1S no helper.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.38</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Allah is the Knower of what is unseen m the  heavens and the earth;
<br> surely He is Cognizant of what IS m  the hearts.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.39</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who made you rulers in the land;
<br> therefore  whoever disbelieves,
<br> his unbelief is against himself;
<br> and  their unbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their  Lord in anything except hatred;
<br> and their unbelief does not  increase the disbelievers m anything except loss.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Have you considered your associates which you call  upon besides Allah?
<br> Show me what part of the earth they have  created,
<br> or have they any share in the heavens;
<br> or,
<br> have We  given them a book so that they follow a clear argument  thereof?
<br> Nay,
<br> the unjust do not hold out promises one to  another but only to deceive.
<br>    41 Surely Allah upholds the heavens and the earth lest they  come to naught;
<br> and if they should come to naught,
<br> there Is  none who can uphold them after Him;
<br> surely He is the  Forbearing,
<br> the Forgiving.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.42</b>]
<br>
<br> And they swore by Allah with the strongest of their  oaths that if there came to them a warner they would be  better guided than any of the nations;
<br> but when there came  to them a warner it increased them in naught but aversion.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.43</b>]
<br>
<br> (In) behaving proudly in the land and in planning evil;
<br>  and the evil plans shall not beset any save the authors of  it.
<br> Then should they wait for aught except the way of the  former people?
<br> For you shall not find any alteration in the  course of Allah;
<br> and you shall not find any change in the  course of Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.44</b>]
<br>
<br> Have they not travelled in the land and seen how was the  end of those before them while they were stronger than these  in power?
<br> And Allah is not such that any thing in the  heavens or in the earth should escape Him;
<br> surely He is  Knowing,
<br> Powerful.
<br>
<a name = "verse35_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>35.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And were Allah to punish men for what they earn,
<br> He  would not leave on the back of it any creature,
<br> but He  respites them till an appointed term;
<br> so when their doom  shall come,
<br> then surely Allah is Seeing with respect to His  servants.
