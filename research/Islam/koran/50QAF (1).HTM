<p><h3>Book 50</h3>
<br><h3>Qaf</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse50_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Qaf.
<br> I swear by the glorious Quran (that Muhammad is the  Apostle of Allah.
)<br>
<a name = "verse50_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> they wonder that there has come to them a warner  from among themselves,
<br> so the unbelievers say:
<br> This is a  wonderful thing:
<br>
<a name = "verse50_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.3</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> when we are dead and have become dust?
<br> That is afar  (from probable) return.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.4</b>]
<br>
<br> We know indeed what the earth diminishes of them,
<br> and  with Us is a writing that preserves.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay,
<br> they rejected the truth when it came to them,
<br> so  they are (now) in a state of confusion.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not then look up to heaven above them how We have  made it and adorned it and it has no gaps?
<br>
<a name = "verse50_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And the earth,
<br> We have made it plain and cast in it  mountains and We have made to grow therein of all beautiful  kinds,
<br>
<a name = "verse50_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.8</b>]
<br>
<br> To give sight and as a reminder to every servant who  turns frequently (to Allah).
<br>
<a name = "verse50_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And We send down from the cloud water abounding in good,
<br>  then We cause to grow thereby gardens and the grain that is  reaped,
<br>
<a name = "verse50_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And the tall palm-trees having spadices closely set one  above another,
<br>
<a name = "verse50_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.11</b>]
<br>
<br> A sustenance for the servants,
<br> and We give life thereby  to a dead land;
<br> thus is the rising.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.12</b>]
<br>
<br> (Others) before them rejected (prophets):
<br> the people of  Nuh and the dwellers of Ar-Rass and Samood,
<br>
<a name = "verse50_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And Ad and Firon and Lut's brethren,
<br>
<a name = "verse50_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And the dwellers of the grove and the people of Tuba;
<br>  all rejected the apostles,
<br> so My threat came to pass.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Were We then fatigued with the first creation?
<br> Yet are  they in doubt with regard to a new creation.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.16</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We created man,
<br> and We know what his mind  suggests to him,
<br> and We are nearer to him than his  life-vein.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.17</b>]
<br>
<br> When the two receivers receive,
<br> sitting on the right and  on the left.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.18</b>]
<br>
<br> He utters not a word but there is by him a watcher at  hand.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And the stupor of death will come in truth;
<br> that is what  you were trying to escape.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And the trumpet shall be blown;
<br> that is the day of the  threatening.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And every soul shall come,
<br> with it a driver and a  witness.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly you were heedless of it,
<br> but now We have  removed from you your veil,
<br> so your sight today is sharp.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And his companions shall say:
<br> This is what is ready with  me.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Do cast into hell every ungrateful,
<br> rebellious one,
<br>
<a name = "verse50_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Forbidder of good,
<br> exceeder of limits,
<br> doubter,
<br>
<a name = "verse50_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Who sets up another god with Allah,
<br> so do cast him into  severe chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.27</b>]
<br>
<br> His companion will say:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> I did not lead him  into inordinacy but he himself was in a great error.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.28</b>]
<br>
<br> He will say:
<br> Do not quarrel in My presence,
<br> and indeed I  gave you the threatening beforehand:
<br>
<a name = "verse50_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.29</b>]
<br>
<br> My word shall not be changed,
<br> nor am I in the least  unjust to the servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.30</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day that We will say to hell:
<br> Are you filled up?
<br>  And it will say:
<br> Are there any more?
<br>
<a name = "verse50_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.31</b>]
<br>
<br> And the garden shall be brought near to those who guard  (against evil),
<br> not far off:
<br>
<a name = "verse50_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.32</b>]
<br>
<br> This is what you were promised,
<br> (it is) for every one  who turns frequently (to Allah),
<br> keeps (His limits);
<br>
<a name = "verse50_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Who fears the Beneficent God in secret and comes with a  penitent heart:
<br>
<a name = "verse50_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Enter it in peace,
<br> that is the day of abiding.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.35</b>]
<br>
<br> They have therein what they wish and with Us is more  yet.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many a generation did We destroy before them who  were mightier in prowess than they,
<br> so they went about and  about in the lands.
<br> Is there a place of refuge?
<br>
<a name = "verse50_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely there is a reminder in this for him who has  a heart or he gives ear and is a witness.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We created the heavens and the earth and  what is between them in six periods and there touched Us not  any fatigue.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore be patient of what they say,
<br> and sing the  praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before  the setting.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.40</b>]
<br>
<br> And glorify Him in the night and after the prayers.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.41</b>]
<br>
 And listen on the day when the crier shall cry from a  near place<br>
<a name = "verse50_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.42</b>]
<br>
<br> The day when they shall hear the cry in truth;
<br> that is  the day of coming forth.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We give life and cause to die,
<br> and to Us is the  eventual coming;
<br>
<a name = "verse50_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.44</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which the earth shall cleave asunder under  them,
<br> they will make haste;
<br> that is a gathering together  easy to Us.
<br>
<a name = "verse50_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>50.45</b>]
<br>
<br> We know best what they say,
<br> and you are not one to  compel them;
<br> therefore remind him by means of the Quran who  fears My threat.
