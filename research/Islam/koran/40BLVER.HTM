<p><h3>Book 40</h3>
<br><h3>The Believer</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse40_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ha Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.2</b>]
<br>
<br> The revelation of the Book is from Allah,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the  Knowing,
<br>
<a name = "verse40_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.3</b>]
<br>
<br> The Forgiver of the faults and the Acceptor of  repentance,
<br> Severe to punish,
<br> Lord of bounty;
<br> there is no  god but He;
<br> to Him is the eventual coming.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.4</b>]
<br>
<br> None dispute concerning the communications of Allah but  those who disbelieve,
<br> therefore let not their going to and  fro in the cities deceive you.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.5</b>]
<br>
<br> The people of Nuh and the parties after them rejected  (prophets) before them,
<br> and every nation purposed against  their apostle to destroy him,
<br> and they disputed by means of  the falsehood that they might thereby render null the truth,
<br>  therefore I destroyed them;
<br> how was then My retribution!
<br>
<a name = "verse40_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And thus did the word of your Lord prove true against  those who disbelieved that they are the inmates of the fire.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who bear the power and those around Him celebrate  the praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask  protection for those who believe:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> Thou embracest  all things in mercy and knowledge,
<br> therefore grant  protection to those who turn (to Thee) and follow Thy way,
<br>  and save them from the punishment of the hell:
<br>
<a name = "verse40_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Our Lord!
<br> and make them enter the gardens of perpetuity  which Thou hast promised to them and those who do good of  their fathers and their wives and their offspring,
<br> surely  Thou are the Mighty,
<br> the Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And keep them from evil deeds,
<br> and whom Thou keepest from  evil deeds this day,
<br> indeed Thou hast mercy on him,
<br> and that  is the mighty achievement.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who disbelieve shall be cried out to:
<br>  Certainly Allah's hatred (of you) when you were called upon  to the faith and you rejected,
<br> is much greater than your  hatred of yourselves.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.11</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> twice didst Thou make us  subject to death,
<br> and twice hast Thou given us life,
<br> so we  do confess our faults;
<br> is there then a way to get out?
<br>
<a name = "verse40_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.12</b>]
<br>
<br> That is because when Allah alone was called upon,
<br> you  disbelieved,
<br> and when associates were given to Him,
<br> you  believed;
<br> so judgment belongs to Allah,
<br> the High,
<br> the Great.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.13</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who shows you His signs and sends down for you  sustenance from heaven,
<br> and none minds but he who turns (to  Him) again and again.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore call upon Allah,
<br> being sincere to Him in  obedience,
<br> though the unbelievers are averse:
<br>
<a name = "verse40_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Possessor of the highest rank,
<br> Lord of power:
<br> He makes  the inspiration to light by His command upon whom He pleases  of His servants,
<br> that he may warn (men) of the day of  meeting.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.16</b>]
<br>
<br> (Of) the day when they shall come forth,
<br> nothing  concerning them remains hidden to Allah.
<br> To whom belongs the  kingdom this day?
<br> To Allah,
<br> the One,
<br> the Subduer (of all).
<br>
<a name = "verse40_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.17</b>]
<br>
<br> This day every soul shall be rewarded for what it has  earned;
<br> no injustice (shall be done) this day;
<br> surely Allah  is quick in reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And warn them of the day that draws near,
<br> when hearts  shall rise up to the throats,
<br> grieving inwardly;
<br> the unjust  shall not have any compassionate friend nor any intercessor  who should be obeyed.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.19</b>]
<br>
<br> He knows the stealthy looks and that which the breasts  conceal.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And Allah judges with the truth;
<br> and those whom they  call upon besides Him cannot judge aught;
<br> surely Allah is  the Hearing,
<br> the Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was  the end of those who were before them?
<br> Mightier than these  were they in strength-- and in fortifications in the land,
<br> but  Allah destroyed them for their sins;
<br> and there was not for  them any defender against Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.22</b>]
<br>
<br> That was because there came to them their apostles with  clear arguments,
<br> but they rejected (them),
<br> therefore Allah  destroyed them;
<br> surely He is Strong,
<br> Severe in retribution.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent Musa with Our communications and  clear authority,
<br>
<a name = "verse40_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.24</b>]
<br>
<br> To Firon and Haman and Qaroun,
<br> but they said:
<br> A lying  magician.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.25</b>]
<br>
<br> So when he brought to them the truth from Us,
<br> they said:
<br>  Slay the sons of those who believe with him and keep their  women alive;
<br> and the struggle of the unbelievers will only  come to a state of perdition.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon said:
<br> Let me alone that I may slay Musa and  let him call upon his Lord;
<br> surely I fear that he will  change your religion or that he will make mischief to appear  in the land.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And Musa said:
<br> Surely I take refuge with my Lord and--  your Lord from every proud one who does not believe in the  day of reckoning.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And a believing man of Firon's people who hid his faith  said:
<br> What!
<br> will you slay a man because he says:
<br> My Lord is  Allah,
<br> and indeed he has brought to you clear arguments from  your Lord?
<br> And if he be a liar,
<br> on him will be his lie,
<br> and  if he be truthful,
<br> there will befall you some of that which  he threatens you (with);
<br> surely Allah does not guide him who  is extravagant,
<br> a liar:
<br>
<a name = "verse40_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.29</b>]
<br>
<br> O my people!
<br> yours is the kingdom this day,
<br> being  masters in the land,
<br> but who will help us against the  punishment of Allah if it come to us?
<br> Firon said:
<br> I do not  show you aught but that which I see (myself),
<br> and I do not  make you follow any but the right way.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And he who believed said:
<br> O my people!
<br> surely I fear for  you the like of what befell the parties:
<br>
<a name = "verse40_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.31</b>]
<br>
<br> The like of what befell the people of Nuh and Ad and  Samood and those after them,
<br> and Allah does not desire  injustice for (His) servants;
<br>
<a name = "verse40_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> O my people!
<br> I fear for you the day of calling out,
<br>
<a name = "verse40_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.33</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which you will turn back retreating;
<br> there  shall be no savior for you from Allah,
<br> and whomsoever Allah  causes to err,
<br> there is no guide for him:
<br>
<a name = "verse40_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly Yusuf came to you before with clear  arguments,
<br> but you ever remained in doubt as to what he  brought;
<br> until when he died,
<br> you said:
<br> Allah will never  raise an apostle after him.
<br> Thus does Allah cause him to err  who is extravagant,
 a doubter<br>
<a name = "verse40_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who dispute concerning the communications of Allah  without any authority that He has given them;
<br> greatly hated  is it by Allah and by-those who believe.
<br> Thus does Allah set  a seal over the heart of every proud,
<br> haughty one.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.36</b>]
<br>
<br> And Firon said:
<br> O Haman!
<br> build for me a tower that I may  attain the means of access,
<br>
<a name = "verse40_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.37</b>]
<br>
<br> The means of access to the heavens,
<br> then reach the God  of Musa,
<br> and I surely think him to be a liar.
<br> And thus the  evil of his deed was made fairseeming to Firon,
<br> and he was  turned away from the way;
<br> and the struggle of Firon was not  (to end) in aught but destruction.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.38</b>]
<br>
<br> And he who believed said:
<br> O my people!
<br> follow me,
<br> I will  guide you to the right course;
<br>
<a name = "verse40_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.39</b>]
<br>
<br> O my people!
<br> this life of the world is only a (passing)  enjoyment,
<br> and surely the hereafter is the abode to settle;
<br>
<a name = "verse40_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Whoever does an evil,
<br> he shall not be recompensed (with  aught) but the like of it,
<br> and whoever does good,
<br> whether  male or female,
<br> and he is a believer,
<br> these shall enter the  garden,
<br> in which they shall be given sustenance without  measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.41</b>]
<br>
<br> And,
<br> O my people!
<br> how is it that I call you to salvation  and you call me to the fire?
<br>
<a name = "verse40_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.42</b>]
<br>
<br> You call on me that I should disbelieve in Allah and  associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge,
<br> and I  call you to the Mighty,
<br> the most Forgiving;
<br>
<a name = "verse40_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.43</b>]
<br>
<br> No doubt that what you call me to has no title to be  called to in this world,
<br> nor in the hereafter,
<br> and that our  turning back is to Allah,
<br> and that the extravagant are the  inmates of the fire;
<br>
<a name = "verse40_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.44</b>]
<br>
<br> So you shall remember what I say to you,
<br> and I entrust  my affair to Allah,
<br> Surely Allah sees the servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.45</b>]
<br>
<br> So Allah protected him from the evil (consequences) of  what they planned,
<br> and the most evil punishment overtook  Firon's people:
<br>
<a name = "verse40_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.46</b>]
<br>
<br> The fire;
<br> they shall be brought before it (every)  morning and evening and on the day when the hour shall come  to pass:
<br> Make Firon's people enter the severest  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.47</b>]
<br>
<br> And when they shall contend one with another in the  fire,
<br> then the weak shall say to those who were proud:
<br>  Surely we were your followers;
<br> will you then avert from us a  portion of the fire?
<br>
<a name = "verse40_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.48</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who were proud shall say:
<br> Surely we are all in it:
<br>  surely Allah has judged between the servants.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.49</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who are in the fire shall say to the keepers  of hell:
<br> Call upon your Lord that He may lighten to us one  day of the punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.50</b>]
<br>
<br> They shall say:
<br> Did not your apostles come to you with  clear arguments?
<br> They shall say:
<br> Yea.
<br> They shall say:
<br> Then  call.
<br> And the call of the unbelievers is only in error.
<br>    51 .
<br> Most surely We help Our apostles,
<br> and those who  believe,
 in this world's life and on the day when the  witnesses shall stand<br>
<a name = "verse40_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.52</b>]
<br>
<br> The day on which their excuse shall not benefit the  unjust,
<br> and for them is curse and for them is the evil  abode.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.53</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave Musa the guidance,
<br> and We made the  children of Israel inherit the Book,
<br>
<a name = "verse40_53"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.54</b>]
<br>
<br> A guidance and a reminder to the men of understanding.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_54"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.55</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore be patient;
<br> surely the promise of Allah is  true;
<br> and ask protection for your fault and sing the praise  of your Lord in the evening and the morning.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_55"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.56</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who dispute about the  communications of Allah without any authority that has come  to them,
<br> there is naught in their breasts but (a desire) to  become great which they shall never attain to;
<br> Therefore  seek refuge in Allah,
<br> surely He is the Hearing,
<br> the Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_56"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.57</b>]
<br>
<br> Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is  greater than the creation of the men,
 but most people do not  know<br>
<a name = "verse40_57"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.58</b>]
<br>
<br> And the blind and the seeing are not alike,
<br> nor those  who believe and do good and the evil-doer;
<br> little is it that  you are mindful.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_58"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.59</b>]
<br>
<br> Most surely the hour is coming,
<br> there is no doubt  therein,
<br> but most people do not believe.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_59"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.60</b>]
<br>
<br> And your Lord says:
<br> Call upon Me,
<br> I will answer you;
<br>  surely those who are too proud for My service shall soon  enter hell abased.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_60"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.61</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is He Who made for you the night that you may rest  therein and the day to see;
<br> most surely Allah is Gracious to  men,
<br> but most men do not give thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_61"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.62</b>]
<br>
<br> That is Allah,
<br> your Lord,
<br> the Creator of everything;
<br>  there is no God but He;
<br> whence are you then turned away?
<br>
<a name = "verse40_62"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.63</b>]
<br>
<br> Thus were turned away those who denied the  communications of Allah.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_63"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.64</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is He Who made the earth a resting-place for you  and the heaven a canopy,
<br> and He formed you,
<br> then made goodly  your forms,
<br> and He provided you with goodly things;
<br> that is  Allah,
<br> your Lord;
<br> blessed then is Allah,
<br> the Lord of the  worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_64"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.65</b>]
<br>
<br> He is the Living,
<br> there is no god but He,
<br> therefore call  on Him,
<br> being sincere to Him in obedience;
<br> (all) praise is  due to Allah,
<br> the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_65"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.66</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon  besides Allah when clear arguments have come to me from my  Lord,
<br> and I am commanded that I should submit to the Lord of  the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_66"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.67</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who created you from dust,
<br> then from a small  lifegerm,
<br> then from a clot,
<br> then He brings you forth as a  child,
<br> then that you may attain your maturity,
<br> then that you  may be old-- and of you there are some who are caused to die  before-- and that you may reach an appointed term,
<br> and that  you may understand.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_67"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.68</b>]
<br>
<br> He it is Who gives life and brings death,
<br> so when He  decrees an affair,
<br> He only says to it:
<br> Be,
<br> and it is.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_68"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.69</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not seen those who dispute with respect to the  communications of Allah:
<br> how are they turned away?
<br>
<a name = "verse40_69"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.70</b>]
<br>
<br> Those who reject the Book and that with which We have  sent Our Apostle;
<br> but they shall soon come to know,
<br>
<a name = "verse40_70"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.71</b>]
<br>
<br> When the fetters and the chains shall be on their necks;
<br>  they shall be dragged 72.
<br> Into boiling water,
<br> then in the  fire shall they be burned;
<br>
<a name = "verse40_71"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.73</b>]
<br>
<br> Then shall it be said to them:
 Where is that which you  used to set up<br>
<a name = "verse40_72"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.74</b>]
<br>
<br> Besides Allah?
<br> They shall say:
<br> They are gone away from  us,
<br> nay,
<br> we used not to call upon anything before.
<br> Thus does  Allah confound the unbelievers.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_73"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.75</b>]
<br>
<br> That is because you exulted in the land unjustly and  because you behaved insolently.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_74"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.76</b>]
<br>
<br> Enter the gates of hell to abide therein,
<br> evil then is  the abode of the proud.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_75"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.77</b>]
<br>
<br> So be patient,
<br> surely the promise of Allah is true.
<br> So  should We make you see part of what We threaten them with,
<br>  or should We cause you to die,
<br> to Us shall they be returned.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_76"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.78</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We sent apostles before you:
<br> there are  some of them that We have mentioned to you and there are  others whom We have not mentioned to you,
<br> and it was not  meet for an apostle that he should bring a sign except with  Allah's permission,
<br> but when the command of Allah came,
<br>  judgment was given with truth,
<br> and those who treated (it) as  a lie were lost.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_77"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.79</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is He Who made the cattle for you that you may  ride on some of them,
<br> and some of them you eat.
<br>
<a name = "verse40_78"></a>
<p>
[<b>40.80</b>]
<br>
<br> And there are advantages for you in them,
<br> and that you  may attain thereon a want which is in your breasts,
<br> and upon  them and upon the ships you are borne.
<br>
