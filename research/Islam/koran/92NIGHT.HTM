<p><h3>Book 92</h3>
<br><h3>The Night</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse92_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.1</b>]
<br>
<br> I swear by the night when it draws a veil,
<br>
<a name = "verse92_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.2</b>]
<br>
<br> And the day when it shines in brightness,
<br>
<a name = "verse92_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And the creating of the male and the female,
<br>
<a name = "verse92_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Your striving is most surely (directed to) various  (ends).
  <br>
<a name = "verse92_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  Then as for him who gives away and guards (against evil),
<br>
<a name = "verse92_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And accepts the best,
<br>
<a name = "verse92_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.7</b>]
<br>
<br> We will facilitate for him the easy end.
<br>
<a name = "verse92_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for him who is niggardly and considers himself  free from need (of Allah),
<br>
<a name = "verse92_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.9</b>]
<br>
<br> And rejects the best,
<br>
<a name = "verse92_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.10</b>]
<br>
<br> We will facilitate for him the difficult end.
<br>
<a name = "verse92_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And his wealth will not avail him when he perishes.
<br>
<a name = "verse92_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely Ours is it to show the way,
<br>
<a name = "verse92_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely Ours is the hereafter and the former.
<br>
<a name = "verse92_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore I warn you of the fire that flames:
<br>
<a name = "verse92_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.15</b>]
<br>
<br> None shall enter it but the most unhappy,
<br>
<a name = "verse92_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Who gives the lie (to the truth) and turns (his) back.
<br>
<a name = "verse92_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And away from it shall be kept the one who guards most  (against evil),
<br>
<a name = "verse92_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Who gives away his wealth,
 purifying himself<br>
<a name = "verse92_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And no one has with him any boon for which he should be  rewarded,
<br>
<a name = "verse92_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Except the seeking of the pleasure of his Lord,
<br> the Most  High.
<br>
<a name = "verse92_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>92.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And he shall soon be well-pleased.
