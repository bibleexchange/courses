<p><h3>Book 32</h3>
<br><h3>The Adoration</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse32_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Alif Lam Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.2</b>]
<br>
<br> The revelation of the Book,
<br> there is no doubt in it,
<br> is  from the Lord of the worlds.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do they say:
<br> He has forged it?
<br> Nay!
<br> it is the truth  from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner  has come before you,
<br> that they may follow the right  direction.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and  what is between them in six periods,
<br> and He mounted the  throne (of authority);
<br> you have not besides Him any guardian  or any intercessor,
<br> will you not then mind?
<br>
<a name = "verse32_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.5</b>]
<br>
<br> He regulates the affair from the heaven to the earth;
<br>  then shall it ascend to Him in a day the measure of which is  a thousand years of what you count.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.6</b>]
<br>
<br> This is the Knower of the unseen and the seen,
<br> the Mighty  the Merciful,
<br>
<a name = "verse32_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Who made good everything that He has created,
<br> and He  began the creation of man from dust.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Then He made his progeny of an extract,
<br> of water held in  light estimation.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Then He made him complete and breathed into him of His  spirit,
<br> and made for you the ears and the eyes and the  hearts;
<br> little is it that you give thanks.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.10</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> What!
<br> when we have become lost in the  earth,
<br> shall we then certainly be in a new creation?
<br> Nay!
<br>  they are disbelievers in the meeting of their Lord.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> The angel of death who is given charge of you shall  cause you to die,
<br> then to your Lord you shall be brought  back.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And could you but see when the guilty shall hang down  their heads before their Lord:
<br> Our Lord!
<br> we have seen and we  have heard,
<br> therefore send us back,
<br> we will do good;
<br> surely  (now) we are certain.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.13</b>]
<br>
<br> And if We had pleased We would certainly have given to  every soul its guidance,
<br> but the word (which had gone forth)  from Me was just:
<br> I will certainly fill hell with the jinn  and men together.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.14</b>]
<br>
<br> So taste,
<br> because you neglected the meeting of this day  of yours;
<br> surely We forsake you;
<br> and taste the abiding  chastisement for what you did.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Only they believe in Our communications who,
<br> when they  are reminded of them,
<br> fall down making obeisance and  celebrate the praise of their Lord,
<br> and they are not proud.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.16</b>]
<br>
<br> Their sides draw away from (their) beds,
<br> they call upon  their Lord in fear and in hope,
<br> and they spend  (benevolently) out of what We have given them.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.17</b>]
<br>
<br> So no soul knows what is hidden for them of that which  will refresh the eyes;
<br> a reward for what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.18</b>]
<br>
<br> Is he then who is a believer like him who is a  transgressor?
<br> They are not equal.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.19</b>]
<br>
<br> As for those who believe and do good,
<br> the gardens are  their abiding-place;
<br> an entertainment for what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And as for those who transgress,
<br> their abode is the  fire;
<br> whenever they desire to go forth from it they shall be  brought back into it,
<br> and it will be said to them:
<br> Taste the  chastisement of the fire which you called a lie.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And most certainly We will make them taste of the nearer  chastisement before the greater chastisement that haply they  may turn.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.22</b>]
<br>
<br> And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the  communications of his Lord,
<br> then he turns away from them?
<br>  Surely We will give punishment to the guilty.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.23</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We gave the Book to Musa,
<br> so be not in  doubt concerning the receiving of it,
<br> and We made it a guide  for the children of Israel.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.24</b>]
<br>
<br> And We made of them Imams to guide by Our command when  they were patient,
<br> and they were certain of Our  communications.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely your Lord will judge between them on the day of  resurrection concerning that wherein they differ.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.26</b>]
<br>
<br> Does it not point out to them the right way,
<br> how many of  the generations,
<br> in whose abodes they go about,
<br> did We  destroy before them?
<br> Most surely there are signs in this;
<br>  will they not then hear?
<br>
<a name = "verse32_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Do they not see that We drive the water to a land having  no herbage,
<br> then We bring forth thereby seed-produce of  which their cattle and they themselves eat;
<br> will they not  then see?
<br>
<a name = "verse32_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.28</b>]
<br>
<br> And they say:
<br> When will this judgment take place,
<br> If you  are truthful?
<br>
<a name = "verse32_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> On the day of judgment the faith of those who (now)  disbelieve will not profit them,
<br> nor will they be respited.
<br>
<a name = "verse32_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>32.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore turn away from them and wait,
<br> surely they too  are waiting.
