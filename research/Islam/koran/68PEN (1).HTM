<p><h3>Book 68</h3>
<br><h3>The Pen</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
      </p>
<a name = "verse68_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Noon.
<br> I swear by the pen and what the angels write,
<br>
<a name = "verse68_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.2</b>]
<br>
<br> By the grace of your Lord you are not mad.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely you shall have a reward never to be cut  off.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And most surely you conform (yourself) to sublime  morality.
  <br>
<a name = "verse68_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.5</b>]
<br>
<br>  So you shall see,
<br> and they (too) shall see,
<br>
<a name = "verse68_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Which of you is afflicted with madness.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely your Lord best knows him who errs from His way,
<br>  and He best knows the followers of the right course.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.8</b>]
<br>
<br> So do not yield to the rejecters.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.9</b>]
<br>
<br> They wish that you should be pliant so they (too) would  be pliant.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.10</b>]
<br>
 And yield not to any mean swearer<br>
<a name = "verse68_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Defamer,
 going about with slander<br>
<a name = "verse68_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Forbidder of good,
<br> outstepping the limits,
<br> sinful,
<br>
<a name = "verse68_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Ignoble,
<br> besides all that,
<br> base-born;
<br>
<a name = "verse68_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Because he possesses wealth and sons.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.15</b>]
<br>
<br> When Our communications are recited to him,
<br> he says:
<br>  Stories of those of yore.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.16</b>]
<br>
<br> We will brand him on the nose.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We will try them as We tried the owners of the  garden,
<br> when they swore that they would certainly cut off  the produce in the morning,
<br>
<a name = "verse68_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.18</b>]
<br>
<br> And were not willing to set aside a portion (for the  poor).
<br>
<a name = "verse68_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.19</b>]
<br>
<br> Then there encompassed it a visitation from your Lord  while they were sleeping.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.20</b>]
<br>
<br> So it became as black,
<br> barren land.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And they called out to each other in the morning,
<br>
<a name = "verse68_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Saying:
<br> Go early to your tilth if you would cut (the  produce).
<br>
<a name = "verse68_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.23</b>]
<br>
<br> So they went,
<br> while they consulted together secretly,
<br>
<a name = "verse68_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Saying:
<br> No poor man shall enter it today upon you.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And in the morning they went,
<br> having the power to  prevent.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.26</b>]
<br>
<br> But when they saw it,
<br> they said:
 Most surely we have  gone astray<br>
<a name = "verse68_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> we are made to suffer privation.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.28</b>]
<br>
<br> The best of them said:
<br> Did I not say to you,
<br> Why do you  not glorify (Allah)?
<br>
<a name = "verse68_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.29</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Glory be to our Lord,
<br> surely we were unjust.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.30</b>]
<br>
<br> Then some of them advanced against others,
<br> blaming each  other.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.31</b>]
<br>
<br> Said they:
<br> O woe to us!
<br> surely we were inordinate:
<br>
<a name = "verse68_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.32</b>]
<br>
<br> Maybe,
<br> our Lord will give us instead one better than it;
<br>  surely to our Lord do we make our humble petition.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Such is the chastisement,
<br> and certainly the chastisement  of the hereafter is greater,
<br> did they but know!
<br>
<a name = "verse68_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.34</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who guard (against evil) shall have with  their Lord gardens of bliss.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.35</b>]
<br>
<br> What!
<br> shall We then make (i.
<br>e.
<br> treat) those who submit  as the guilty?
<br>
<a name = "verse68_36"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.36</b>]
<br>
<br> What has happened to you?
<br> How do you judge?
<br>
<a name = "verse68_37"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.37</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have you a book wherein you read,
<br>
<a name = "verse68_38"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.38</b>]
<br>
<br> That you have surely therein what you choose?
<br>
<a name = "verse68_39"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.39</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have you received from Us an agreement confirmed by  an oath extending to the day of resurrection that you shall  surely have what you demand?
<br>
<a name = "verse68_40"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.40</b>]
<br>
<br> Ask them which of them will vouch for that,
<br>
<a name = "verse68_41"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.41</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have.
<br>they associates if they are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_42"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.42</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when there shall be a severe affliction,
<br> and  they shall be called upon to make obeisance,
<br> but they shall  not be able,
<br>
<a name = "verse68_43"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.43</b>]
<br>
<br> Their looks cast down,
<br> abasement shall overtake them;
<br>  and they were called upon to make obeisance indeed while yet  they were safe.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_44"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.44</b>]
<br>
<br> So leave Me and him who rejects this announcement;
<br> We  will overtake them by degrees,
<br> from whence they perceive  not:
<br>
<a name = "verse68_45"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.45</b>]
<br>
<br> And I do bear with them,
<br> surely My plan is firm.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_46"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.46</b>]
<br>
<br> Or do you ask from them a reward,
<br> so that they are  burdened with debt?
<br>
<a name = "verse68_47"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.47</b>]
<br>
<br> Or have they (the knowledge of) the unseen,
<br> so that they  write (it) down?
<br>
<a name = "verse68_48"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.48</b>]
<br>
<br> So wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord,
<br> and be  not like the companion of the fish,
<br> when he cried while he  was in distress.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_49"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.49</b>]
<br>
<br> Were it not that favor from his Lord had overtaken him,
<br>  he would certainly have been cast down upon the naked Found  while he was blamed.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_50"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.50</b>]
<br>
<br> Then his Lord chose him,
<br> and He made him of the good.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_51"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.51</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve would almost smite you with  their eyes when they hear the reminder,
<br> and they say:
<br> Most  surely he is mad.
<br>
<a name = "verse68_52"></a>
<p>
[<b>68.52</b>]
<br>
<br> And it is naught but a reminder to the nations.
