<p><h3>Book 46</h3>
<br><h3>The Sandhills</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse46_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Ha Mim.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.2</b>]
<br>
<br> The revelation of the Book is from Allah,
<br> the Mighty,
<br> the  Wise.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.3</b>]
<br>
<br> We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is  between them two save with truth and (for) an appointed  term;
<br> and those who disbelieve turn aside from what they are  warned of.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Have you considered what you call upon besides  Allah?
<br> Show me what they have created of the earth,
<br> or have  they a share in the heavens?
<br> Bring me a book before this or  traces of knowledge,
<br> if you are truthful.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.5</b>]
<br>
<br> And who is in greater error than he who calls besides  Allah upon those that will not answer him till the day of  resurrection and they are heedless of their call?
<br>
<a name = "verse46_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.6</b>]
<br>
<br> And when men are gathered together they shall be their  enemies,
<br> and shall be deniers of their worshipping (them).
<br>
<a name = "verse46_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.7</b>]
<br>
<br> And when Our clear communications are recited to them,
<br>  those who disbelieve say with regard to the truth when it  comes to them:
<br> This is clear magic.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Nay!
<br> they say:
<br> He has forged it.
<br> Say:
<br> If I have forged  it,
<br> you do not control anything for me from Allah;
<br> He knows  best what you utter concerning it;
<br> He is enough as a witness  between me and you,
<br> and He is the Forgiving,
<br> the Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.9</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> I am not the first of the apostles,
<br> and I do not  know what will be done with me or with you:
<br> I do not follow  anything but that which is revealed to me,
<br> and I am nothing  but a plain warner.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Say:
<br> Have you considered if it is from Allah,
<br> and you  disbelieve in it,
<br> and a witness from among the children of  Israel has borne witness of one like it,
<br> so he believed,
<br>  while you are big with pride;
<br> surely Allah does not guide  the unjust people.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.11</b>]
<br>
<br> And those who disbelieve say concerning those who  believe:
<br> If it had been a good,
<br> they would not have gone  ahead of us therein.
<br> And as they do not seek to be rightly  directed thereby,
<br> they say:
<br> It is an old lie.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And before it the Book of Musa was a guide and a mercy:
<br>  and this is a Book verifying (it) in the Arabic language  that it may warn those who are unjust and as good news for  the doers of good.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who say,
<br> Our Lord is Allah,
<br> then they  continue on the right way,
<br> they shall have no fear nor shall  they grieve.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.14</b>]
<br>
<br> These are the dwellers of the garden,
<br> abiding therein:
<br> a  reward for what they did.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And We have enjoined on man doing of good to his  parents;
<br> with trouble did his mother bear him and with  trouble did she bring him forth;
<br> and the bearing of him and  the weaning of him was thirty months;
<br> until when he attains  his maturity and reaches forty years,
<br> he says:
<br> My Lord!
<br>  grant me that I may give thanks for Thy favor which Thou  hast bestowed on me and on my parents,
<br> and that I may do  good which pleases Thee and do good to me in respect of my  offspring;
<br> surely I turn to Thee,
<br> and surely I am of those  who submit.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.16</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they from whom We accept the best of what they  have done and pass over their evil deeds,
<br> among the dwellers  of the garden;
<br> the promise of truth which they were  promised.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And he who says to his parents:
<br> Fie on you!
<br> do you  threaten me that I shall be brought forth when generations  have already passed away before me?
<br> And they both call for  Allah's aid:
<br> Woe to you!
<br> believe,
<br> surely the promise of  Allah is true.
<br> But he says:
<br> This is nothing but stories of  the ancients.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.18</b>]
<br>
<br> These are they against whom the word has proved true  among nations of the jinn and the men that have already  passed away before them;
<br> surely they are losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And for all are degrees according to what they did,
<br> and  that He may pay them back fully their deeds and they shall  not be wronged.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be  brought before the fire:
<br> You did away with your good things  in your life of the world and you enjoyed them for a while,
<br>  so today you shall be rewarded with the punishment of  abasement because you were unjustly proud in the land and  because you transgressed.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.21</b>]
<br>
<br> And mention the brother of Ad;
<br> when he warned his people  in the sandy plains,
<br>-- and indeed warners came before him and  after him-- saying Serve none but Allah;
<br> surely I fear for you  the punishment of a grievous day.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.22</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> Have you come to us to turn us away from our  gods;
<br> then bring us what you threaten us with,
<br> if you are of  the truthful ones.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.23</b>]
<br>
<br> He said:
<br> The knowledge is only with Allah,
<br> and I deliver  to you the message with which I am sent,
<br> but I see you are a  people who are ignorant.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.24</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they saw it as a cloud appearing in the sky  advancing towards their valleys,
<br> they said:
<br> This is a cloud  which will give us rain.
<br> Nay!
<br> it is what you sought to  hasten on,
<br> a blast of wind in which is a painful punishment,
<br>
<a name = "verse46_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.25</b>]
<br>
<br> Destroying everything by the command of its Lord,
<br> so  they became such that naught could be seen except their  dwellings.
<br> Thus do We reward the guilty people.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We had established them in what We have  not established you in,
<br> and We had given-- them ears and eyes  and hearts,
<br> but neither their ears,
<br> nor their eyes,
<br> nor  their hearts availed them aught,
<br> since they denied the  communications of Allah,
<br> and that which they mocked  encompassed them.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.27</b>]
<br>
<br> And certainly We destroyed the towns which are around  you,
<br> and We repeat the communications that they might turn.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.28</b>]
<br>
<br> Why did not then those help them whom they took for gods  besides Allah to draw (them) nigh (to Him)?
<br> Nay!
<br> they were  lost to them;
<br> and this was their lie and what they forged.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.29</b>]
<br>
<br> And when We turned towards you a party of the jinn who  listened to the Quran;
<br> so when they came to it,
<br> they said:
<br>  Be silent;
<br> then when it was finished,
<br> they turned back to  their people warning (them).
<br>
<a name = "verse46_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.30</b>]
<br>
<br> They said:
<br> O our people!
<br> we have listened to a Book  revealed after Musa verifying that which is before it,
<br>  guiding to the truth and to a right path:
<br>
<a name = "verse46_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.31</b>]
<br>
<br> O our people!
<br> accept the Divine caller and believe in  Him,
<br> He will forgive you of your faults and protect you from  a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_32"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.32</b>]
<br>
<br> And whoever does not accept the-Divine caller,
<br> he shall  not escape in the earth and he shall not have guardians  besides Him,
<br> these are in manifest error.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_33"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.33</b>]
<br>
<br> Have they not considered that Allah,
<br> Who created the  heavens and the earth and was not tired by their creation,
<br>  is able to give life to the dead?
<br> Aye!
<br> He has surely power  over all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_34"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.34</b>]
<br>
<br> And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be  brought before the fire:
<br> Is it not true?
<br> They shall say:
<br>  Aye!
<br> by our Lord!
<br> He will say:
<br> Then taste the punishment,
<br>  because you disbelieved.
<br>
<a name = "verse46_35"></a>
<p>
[<b>46.35</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore bear up patiently as did the apostles endowed  with constancy bear up with patience and do not seek to  hasten for them (their doom).
<br> On the day that they shall see  what they are promised they shall be as if they had not  tarried save an hour of the day.
<br> A sufficient exposition!
<br>  Shall then any be destroyed save the transgressing people?
