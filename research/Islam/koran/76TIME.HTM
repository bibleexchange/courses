<p><h3>Book 76</h3>
<br><h3>Time</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse76_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.1</b>]
<br>
<br> There surely came over man a period of time when he was a  thing not worth mentioning.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.2</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have created man from a small life-germ uniting  (itself):
<br> We mean to try him,
<br> so We have made him hearing,
<br>  seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.3</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have shown him the way:
<br> he may be thankful or  unthankful.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.4</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We have prepared for the unbelievers chains and  shackles and a burning fire.
  <br>
<a name = "verse76_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.5</b>]
<br>
  Surely the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture  of which is camphor<br>
<a name = "verse76_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.6</b>]
<br>
<br> A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink;
<br>  they make it to flow a (goodly) flowing forth.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.7</b>]
<br>
<br> They fulfill vows and fear a day the evil of which shall  be spreading far and wide.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And they give food out of love for Him to the poor and  the orphan and the captive:
<br>
<a name = "verse76_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.9</b>]
<br>
<br> We only feed you for Allah's sake;
<br> we desire from you  neither reward nor thanks:
<br>
<a name = "verse76_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely we fear from our Lord a stern,
<br> distressful day.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.11</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore Allah win guard them from the evil of that day  and cause them to meet with ease and happiness;
<br>
<a name = "verse76_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.12</b>]
<br>
<br> And reward them,
<br> because they were patient,
<br> with garden  and silk,
<br>
<a name = "verse76_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Reclining therein on raised couches,
<br> they shall find  therein neither (the severe heat of) the sun nor intense  cold.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.14</b>]
<br>
<br> And close down upon them (shall be) its shadows,
<br> and its  fruits shall be made near (to them),
<br> being easy to reach.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.15</b>]
<br>
<br> And there shall be made to go round about them vessels  of silver and goblets which are of glass,
<br>
<a name = "verse76_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.16</b>]
<br>
<br> (Transparent as) glass,
<br> made of silver;
<br> they have  measured them according to a measure.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.17</b>]
<br>
<br> And they shall be made to drink therein a cup the  admixture of which shall be ginger,
<br>
<a name = "verse76_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.18</b>]
<br>
<br> (Of) a fountain therein which is named Salsabil.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.19</b>]
<br>
<br> And round about them shall go youths never altering in  age;
<br> when you see them you will think them to be scattered  pearls.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.20</b>]
<br>
<br> And when you see there,
<br> you shall see blessings and a  great kingdom.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Upon them shall be garments of fine green silk and thick  silk interwoven with gold,
<br> and they shall be adorned with  bracelets of silver,
<br> and their Lord shall make them drink a  pure drink.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.22</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely this is a reward for you,
<br> and your striving shall  be recompensed.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_23"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.23</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely We Ourselves have revealed the Quran to you  revealing (it) in portions.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_24"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.24</b>]
<br>
<br> Therefore wait patiently for the command of your Lord,
<br>  and obey not from among them a sinner or an ungrateful one.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_25"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.25</b>]
<br>
<br> And glorify the name of your Lord morning and evening.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_26"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.26</b>]
<br>
<br> And during part of the night adore Him,
<br> and give glory  to Him (a) long (part of the) night.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_27"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.27</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely these love the transitory and neglect a grievous  day before them.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_28"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.28</b>]
<br>
<br> We created them and made firm their make,
<br> and when We  please We will bring in their place the likes of them by a  change.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_29"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.29</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely this is a reminder,
<br> so whoever pleases takes to  his Lord a way.
<br>
<a name = "verse76_30"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.30</b>]
<br>
<br> And you do not please except that Allah please,
<br> surely  Allah is Knowing,
<br> Wise;
<br>
<a name = "verse76_31"></a>
<p>
[<b>76.31</b>]
<br>
<br> He makes whom He pleases to enter into His mercy;
<br> and  (as for) the unjust,
<br> He has prepared for them a painful  chastisement.
