<p><h3>Book 65</h3>
<br><h3>The Divorce</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse65_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.1</b>]
<br>
<br> O Prophet!
<br> when you divorce women,
<br> divorce them for  their prescribed time,
<br> and calculate the number of the days  prescribed,
<br> and be careful of (your duty to) Allah,
<br> your  Lord.
<br> Do not drive them out of their houses,
<br> nor should they  themselves go forth,
<br> unless they commit an open indecency;
<br>  and these are the limits of Allah,
<br> and whoever goes beyond  the limits of Allah,
<br> he indeed does injustice to his own  soul.
<br> You do not know that Allah may after that bring about  reunion.
<br>
<a name = "verse65_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.2</b>]
<br>
<br> So when they have reached their prescribed time,
<br> then  retain them with kindness or separate them with kindness,
<br>  and call to witness two men of justice from among you,
<br> and  give upright testimony for Allah.
<br> With that is admonished he  who believes in Allah and the latter day;
<br> and whoever is  careful of (his duty to) Allah,
<br> He will make for him an  outlet,
<br>
<a name = "verse65_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And give him sustenance from whence he thinks not;
<br> and  whoever trusts in Allah,
<br> He is sufficient for him;
<br> surely  Allah attains His purpose;
<br> Allah indeed has appointed a  measure for everything.
<br>
<a name = "verse65_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.4</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those of your women who have despaired of  menstruation,
<br> if you have a doubt,
<br> their prescribed time  shall be three months,
<br> and of those too who have not had  their courses;
<br> and (as for) the pregnant women,
<br> their  prescribed time is that they lay down their burden;
<br> and  whoever is careful of (his duty to) Allah He will make easy  for him his affair.
<br>
<a name = "verse65_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.5</b>]
<br>
<br> That is the command of Allah which He has revealed to  you,
<br> and whoever is careful of (his duty to) Allah,
<br> He will  remove from him his evil and give him a big reward.
<br>
<a name = "verse65_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.6</b>]
<br>
<br> Lodge them where you lodge according to your means,
<br> and  do not injure them in order that you may straiten them;
<br> and  if they are pregnant,
<br> spend on them until they lay down  their burden;
<br> then if they suckle for you,
<br> give them their  recompense and enjoin one another among you to do good;
<br> and  if you disagree,
<br> another (woman) shall suckle for him.
<br>
<a name = "verse65_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Let him who has abundance spend out of his abundance and  whoever has his means of subsistence straitened to him,
<br> let  him spend out of that which Allah has given him;
<br> Allah does  not lay on any soul a burden except to the extent to which  He has granted it;
<br> Allah brings about ease after difficulty.
<br>
<a name = "verse65_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.8</b>]
<br>
<br> And how many a town which rebelled against the  commandment of its Lord and His apostles,
<br> so We called it to  account severely and We chastised it (with) a stern  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse65_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.9</b>]
<br>
<br> So it tasted the evil result of its conduct,
<br> and the end  of its affair was perdition.
<br>
<a name = "verse65_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has prepared for them severe chastisement,
<br>  therefore be careful of (your duty to) Allah,
<br> O men of  understanding who believe!
<br> Allah has indeed revealed to you  a reminder,
<br>
<a name = "verse65_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.11</b>]
<br>
<br> An Apostle who recites to you the clear communications  of Allah so that he may bring forth those who believe and do  good deeds from darkness into light;
<br> and whoever believes in  Allah and does good deeds,
<br> He will cause him to enter  gardens beneath which rivers now,
<br> to abide therein forever,
<br>  Allah has indeed given him a goodly sustenance.
<br>
<a name = "verse65_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>65.12</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah is He Who created seven heavens,
<br> and of the earth  the like of them;
<br> the decree continues to descend among  them,
<br> that you may know that Allah has power over all things  and that Allah indeed encompasses all things in (His)  knowledge.
