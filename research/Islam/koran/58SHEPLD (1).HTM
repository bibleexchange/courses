<p><h3>Book 58</h3>
<br><h3>She Who Pleaded</h3><p>In the name of Allah,
<br> the Beneficent,
<br> the Merciful.
    </p>
<a name = "verse58_1"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.1</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah indeed knows the plea of her who pleads with you  about her husband and complains to Allah,
<br> and Allah knows  the contentions of both of you;
<br> surely Allah is Hearing,
<br>  Seeing.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_2"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.2</b>]
<br>
<br> (As for) those of you who put away their wives by  likening their backs to the backs of their mothers,
<br> they are  not their mothers;
<br> their mothers are no others than those  who gave them  birth;
<br> and most surely they utter a hateful word and a  falsehood and most surely Allah is Pardoning,
<br> Forgiving.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_3"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.3</b>]
<br>
<br> And (as for) those who put away their wives by likening  their backs to the backs of their mothers then would recall  what they said,
<br> they should free a captive before they touch  each other;
<br> to that you are admonished (to conform);
<br> and  Allah is Aware of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_4"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.4</b>]
<br>
<br> But whoever has not the means,
<br> let him fast for two  months successively before they touch each other;
<br> then as  for him who is not able,
<br> let him feed sixty needy ones;
<br> that  is in order that you may have faith in Allah and His  Apostle,
<br> and these are Allah's limits,
<br> and the unbelievers  shall have a painful punishment.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_5"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.5</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely those who act in opposition to Allah and His  Apostle shall be laid down prostrate as those before them  were laid down prostrate;
<br> and indeed We have revealed clear  communications,
<br> and the unbelievers shall have an abasing  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_6"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.6</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day when Allah will raise them up all together,
<br>  then inform them of what they did:
<br> Allah has recorded it  while they have forgotten it;
<br> and Allah is a witness of all  things.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_7"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.7</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the  heavens and whatever is in the earth?
<br> Nowhere is there a  secret counsel between three persons but He is the fourth of  them,
<br> nor (between) five but He is the sixth of them,
<br> nor  less than that nor more but He is with them wheresoever they  are;
<br> then He will inform them of what they did on the day of  resurrection:
<br> surely Allah is Cognizant of all things.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_8"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.8</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not seen those who are forbidden secret  counsels,
<br> then they return to what they are forbidden,
<br> and  they hold secret counsels for sin and revolt and  disobedience to the Apostle,
<br> and when they come to you they  greet you with a greeting with which Allah does not greet  you,
<br> and they say in themselves:
<br> Why does not Allah punish  us for what we say?
<br> Hell is enough for them;
<br> they shall  enter it,
<br> and evil is the resort.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_9"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.9</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> when you confer together in private,
<br>  do not give to each other counsel of sin and revolt and  disobedience to the Apostle,
<br> and give to each other counsel  of goodness and guarding (against evil);
<br> and be careful of  (your duty to) Allah,
<br> to Whom you shall be gathered  together.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_10"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.10</b>]
<br>
<br> Secret counsels are only (the work) of the Shaitan that  he may cause to grieve those who believe,
<br> and he cannot hurt  them in the least except with Allah's permission,
<br> and on  Allah let the believers rely.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_11"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.11</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> when it is said to you,
<br> Make room in  (your) assemblies,
<br> then make ample room,
<br> Allah will give you  ample,
<br> and when it is said:
<br> Rise up,
<br> then rise up.
<br> Allah  will exalt those of you who believe,
<br> and those who are given  knowledge,
<br> in high degrees;
<br> and Allah is Aware of what you  do.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_12"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.12</b>]
<br>
<br> O you who believe!
<br> when you consult the Apostle,
<br> then  offer something in charity before your consultation;
<br> that is  better for you and purer;
<br> but if you do not find,
<br> then  surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br> Merciful.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_13"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.13</b>]
<br>
<br> Do you fear that you will not (be able to) give in  charity before your consultation?
<br> So when you do not do it  and Allah has turned to you (mercifully),
<br> then keep up  prayer and pay the poor-rate and obey Allah and His Apostle;
<br>  and Allah is Aware of what you do.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_14"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.14</b>]
<br>
<br> Have you not seen those who befriend a people with whom  Allah is wroth?
<br> They are neither of you nor of them,
<br> and  they swear falsely while they know.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_15"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.15</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment;
<br> surely  what they do is evil.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_16"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.16</b>]
<br>
<br> They make their oaths to serve as a cover so they turn  away from Allah's way;
<br> therefore they shall have an abasing  chastisement.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_17"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.17</b>]
<br>
<br> Neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them  aught against Allah;
<br> they are the inmates of the fire,
<br>  therein they shall abide.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_18"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.18</b>]
<br>
<br> On the day that Allah will raise them up all,
<br> then they  will swear to Him as they swear to you,
<br> and they think that  they have something;
<br> now surely they are the liars.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_19"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.19</b>]
<br>
<br> The Shaitan has gained the mastery over them,
<br> so he has  made them forget the remembrance of Allah;
<br> they are the  Shaitan's party;
<br> now surely the Shaitan's party are the  losers.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_20"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.20</b>]
<br>
<br> Surely (as for) those who are in opposition to Allah and  His Apostle;
<br> they shall be among the most abased.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_21"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.21</b>]
<br>
<br> Allah has written down:
<br> I will most certainly prevail,
<br> I    and My apostles;
<br> surely Allah is Strong,
<br> Mighty.
<br>
<a name = "verse58_22"></a>
<p>
[<b>58.22</b>]
<br>
<br> You shall not find a people who believe in Allah and the  latter day befriending those who act in opposition to Allah  and His Apostle,
<br> even though they were their (own) fathers,
<br>  or their sons,
<br> or their brothers,
<br> or their kinsfolk;
<br> these  are they into whose hearts He has impressed faith,
<br> and whom  He has strengthened with an inspiration from Him:
<br> and He  will cause them to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow,
<br>  abiding therein;
<br> Allah is well-pleased with them and they  are well-pleased with Him these are Allah's party:
<br> now  surely the party of Allah are the successful ones.
