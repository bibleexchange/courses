		<p class="cs28FC2028"><span class="cs34D4C764">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">It all begins with a goal that is set. Then true character arises to make the unchangeable decision to reach that goal. To make that a possibility, there is a character in this spirit that produces a determination that will continue to be the envy of many and&nbsp;will be the history lesson of instruction&nbsp;in many of our conversations as long as we live!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one named James Reynolds, that without argument from friends and even enemies, set the goal and reached it!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination to reach that goal began with a call! A call from the voice of God that is high and set apart from any other voice!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s eternal influence is what ignited the flame of experience in true salvation, that rapidly expanded in the soul until it reached the level of an uncontrollable anointing! This anointing put a mighty soldier on his feet in diligent search of every spiritual weapon he would need to accomplish what the call had set before him! TO REACH THAT GOAL!!!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the proclamation that even the regions of Demons and the Devil could hear. As well as&nbsp;fellow soldiers who were hungry to be&nbsp;encouraged in their fight.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He often shouted mighty and strong with fist clinched and raised purposefully HIGH in the air!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot; The Devil is a Liar &quot; &nbsp;&quot; There is no defeat in God &quot; &nbsp;&quot; We must fight for the Right &quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&quot; We must never compromise, but push back the works of the Devil&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my presence I can testify that I never heard him even &quot;Whisper&quot;the language of defeat though I have personally watched him step over the bodies of many fallen comrades and press on. The voice of this great warrior could be heard saying for all to hear. We cannot Stop now. We must reach the Goal!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that the heat of the desert I feel pressing around me he would ask? But then instantly the determination and anointing would say; None the matter. I will trust for his refreshing, but I must fight on!&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Is that the cold of the winter pressing hard against me he would ask? But then here came the same resolve! It never wavered. He again would say; None the matter. I will look for the warmth of his Love, but I must fight on!&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they the rocks of the steep mountainside that are cutting&nbsp;and hurting my feet he would ask?&nbsp;The resolve never failed! Again he would say; I will find the healing of his Grace often enough to make it to the TOP! I Must Fight On!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many attacks did he endure?&nbsp;How many injuries were suffered for long periods of time, even while never leaving the battle field? That number could never be accounted, because he covered most wounds and injuries with a crisp clean uniform, usually&nbsp;refreshed in a closet of fasting and prayer. When he appeared he made sure that he was a representative of his faith in an unfailing God, and never&nbsp;let his wounds produce a mortal pity from man that would in any degree reduce the character of His God!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, but for the natural man, the many battles take their toll. But be it known now and forever!&nbsp;The steps may slow! The fist not raised quite as high, and the voice may not thunder! But that does not mean he is loosing the long hard fought battle! NO! He is just preparing for the final victory! The Goal is in Sight! He is preparing for the final assault! A foe he has never faced! An enemy that the body must perish so the victory of the&nbsp;eternal soul can be revealed Death itself!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prays for the refreshing breeze that bears the fragrance of faith and hope. But he must now find hope and reason to fight on even if the air seems to become stagnant with pressing doubt and fear. This is where he alone must take on the enemy. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">He finally sees the Master of faith coming and saying to him!&nbsp;&quot; No need to give up now&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Then he wispers! I want the last word!!! The family and friends may not of heard it but the final words as he was led across chilly Jordon were &quot; Oh Death, Where is Your Sting &quot; I have reached my goal.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodbye my faithful Friend. I will meet you where we will be safe from all harm. You left me but I am not afraid for the rest of the journey. You left me in Good Hands.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p></body>
