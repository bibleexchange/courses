<h3 class="western">The Bible says there is.</h3>
<h3 class="western">Hell is a place.</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">It is more than a
word, it is a place. And really it does not make too much difference
what you call it, it still is a place.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The young woman
dying, said to her father, &quot;father, why did you not tell me there
was such a place?&quot; &quot;What place?&quot; &quot;A hell!&quot; He said, &quot;Jenny,
there is no such place. God is merciful. There&apos;ll be no future
suffering!&quot; She said, &quot;I know better! My feet are slipping into
it at this moment. I am lost. Why did you not tell me there was such
a place?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">A young man who
had been raised as a Jehovah&apos;s Witness, he said, &quot;all of my life
I was taught that there was no Hell.&quot; However, he murdered a man
and he said, &quot;when I pulled the trigger I knew there was a place
called hell.&quot;</p>
<h3 class="western">Hell is a prepared place.</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Hell is a place
prepared for the devil and his Angels. Matthew 25:41</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">Heaven is a
prepared place for prepared people. However, Hell is a prepared place
for an unprepared people.</p>
<h3 class="western">Hell is not death or the grave.</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%"><font color="#000000"><i>Revelation
20:14 &mdash; death and hell were cast into the Lake of fire.</i></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 115%">The body goes to
the grave, the spirit and soul into hell.</p>
