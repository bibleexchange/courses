> J. WILBUR CHAPMAN-- It is said that some years ago the king of Abyssinia took a British subject, by the name of 
Campbell, prisoner. They carried him to the fortress of Magdala, and in the heights of the 
mountains put him in a dungeon, without cause assigned. It took six months for Great Britain 
to find it out, and then they demanded his instantaneous release. King Theodore refused, and 
in less than ten days ten thousand British soldiers were on shipboard and sailing down the 
coast. They disembarked, and marched seven hundred miles beneath the burning sun up the 
mountains to the very dungeon where the prisoner was held, and there they gave battle. The 
gates were torn down, and presently the prisoner was lifted upon their shoulders, and carried 
down the mountains, and placed upon the white-winged ship, which sped him in safety to his 
home. And it cost the English government twenty-five millions of dollars to release that man.

Not just "IN THE TENT" but special entrance!!

### A Place of Favor

&hellip;in the secret of his tabernacle&hellip; - In the most retired and private part of His dwelling.

In the secret of his tabernacle - In the most retired and private part of His dwelling. He would not merely admit him to His premises; not only to the vestibule of His house; not only to the open court, or to the parts of His house frequented by the rest of His family; but he would admit him to the private apartments - the place to which He Himself withdrew to be alone, and where no stranger, and not even one of the family, would venture to intrude.

PRIVATE, EXCLUSIVE, FAVORED BY GOD "THOU ART HIGHLY FAVORED" Lu 1:28 

### A Place of Fellowship

Treated as one of the family. We WERE beggars, now SIT AMONGST PRINCES.
