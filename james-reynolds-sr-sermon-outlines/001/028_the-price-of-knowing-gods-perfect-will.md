# The Price of Knowing God&apos;s Perfect Will

A sermon outline of Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.

TEXT: Romans 12:1,2

> Romans 12:1,2&mdash;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

- &quot;BESEECH&quot; &mdash; parakaleo &mdash; exhort, pray, implore
- &quot;THEREFORE&quot; Chapter 12 relates directly to what has been said in the previous chapters

## I. The Price is Beyond Man&apos;s Natural Ability

> Romans 11:33&mdash;O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!

### 1. &quot;O the depth&quot; &mdash; bathus &mdash; deep, profound, mystery

### 2. &quot;the riches&quot; &mdash; &quot;both of the wisdom and knowledge of God&quot;

> 1 Corinthians 2:9-10&mdash;But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

### 3. &quot;how unsearchable&quot; &mdash; &quot;ichnos&quot; &mdsah; footprint, track: impossible to follow or find out

### 4. &quot;are His judgments&quot;

### 5.&quot;and His ways past finding out&quot;

This is true of the carnal or natural mind that is confused by too many voices.

## II. The Price of Knowing

> &hellip;therefore&hellip;present your bodies&hellip;

### 1. &quot;a living &quot; &ndash;  &quot;zao&quot;: &quot;live&quot; sacrifice

a living death

### 2. &quot;which is your reasonable service&quot;

rational

In Matthew 16:22, Peter said to Jesus in one translation &quot;spare thyself&quot;

"Be merciful to thyself, spare thyself, or, Let God, or God shall, be merciful unto thee."

### 3. &quot;be not conformed to this world&quot;

shape one thing like another

### 4. &quot;be ye transformed&quot;

The first is outward, but this is inward. The inward change must come first.

### 5. &quot;by the renewing of your mind&quot; &mdash; &quot;renovation&quot;

## III. The Perfect Will of God

### 1. &quot; that ye may prove&quot;

discern, know: &quot;what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God&quot;
