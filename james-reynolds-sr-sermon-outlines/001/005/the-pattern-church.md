# The Pattern Church
TEXT: Acts 2:41-47

> **Acts 2:41** Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. 42 Â¶ And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. 43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common; 45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. 46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

The early church is our model and they key to our effectiveness if bound up in truth and how we handle it.
