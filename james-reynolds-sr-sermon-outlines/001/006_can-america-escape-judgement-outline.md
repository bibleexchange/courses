# Can America Escape Judgment?
[by Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.]

> Isaiah 1:4&mdash;Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.

Can America escape judgment committing the sins that brought judgment on Israel?

## I. The Privileges of the Nation &mdash; vs. 2

### A. Israel was taken from bondage and was brought to an exalted position among the nations and was feared by the nations.

### B. Like Israel, America has been exalted to a high position among the nations and has been feared by the nations.

1. &quot;I have nourished&quot; &mdash; advanced, increased, prospered.
2. &quot;And brought up children&quot; &mdash; raised, fed, protected

### C. God&apos;s grace made the nation great.

1. The measure of opportunity is the measure of responsibility. Privileges require responsibility.
2. The measure of grace is the measure of judgment.
Judgment is according to privilege. &mdash; Matthew 11:24

> &quot;But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.&quot;

## II. The Corruption of the Nation &mdash; vs. 3-6

### A. Their Idolatry &mdash;
1. Gold and silver idols glittered on every street.
2. Incense ascended from altars to heathen gods.

### B. Their Children Sacrificed
They were offered in the flames to Moloch.

### C. Their ingratitude &mdash; vs. 3
In spite of exceptional privileges, they have lowered themselves beneath the level of beasts.

### D. Their Forsaking the Lord &mdash; vs. 4
The sting of death is seen in the statement. Psalm 9:17

### E. Their Incorrigibleness &mdash; vs. 4-5
They refused to change and rebelled more and more.

&quot;Ye will revolt more and more.&quot;
### F. Their Increase in Degeneracy &mdash; vs. 6, 21
Once, the righteous lodged in it; now murderers do.
### G. Their Injustice by their Rulers &mdash; vs. 23
What a statement &mdash; &quot;Princes companions of thieves.&quot;
Looking for bribes &mdash; The justice system had gone bad.

## III. The Results of their Corruption &mdash; vs. 7-8
### A. The judgments of God followed their sins.
1. Ravaged by an Enemy-
&quot;Strangers devour it in your presence&quot;
&quot;Overthrown by strangers&quot;
2. &quot;As a cottage in a vineyard.&quot;
&quot;Booth&quot; frail dwelling &mdash; the insecurity of the nation.

## IV. Their Insincere Efforts to Obtain Mercy &mdash; vs. 11-15
### A. &quot;To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me?&quot;
### B.. God is looking for obedience &mdash; vs.19
1. &quot;If ye be willing and obedient&quot;
2. &quot;To obey is better than sacrifice&quot;
3. Sacrifice by itself is nothing
4. Devotion of the heart and obedience pleases God.

## V. There is Only One Way of Escape &mdash; vs. 16-18

### A. Not armies &mdash; not armament &mdash; But God.

> &quot;Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be scarlet, the shall be as white as snow, though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.&quot;

### B. &quot;Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.&quot; v.9

God has a remnant today that holds back judgment, but it will soon be taken out of the way.
