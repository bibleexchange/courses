<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Preached by James R.
Reynods, Sr. April 3, 2011 Sunday Morning.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Mt 25:1 Then
shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took
their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 2 And five of them
were wise, and five were foolish. [&quot;stupid&quot;]
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 3 They that were
foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 4 But the wise took
oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 5 While the
bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 6 And at midnight
there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to
meet him.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 7 Then all those
virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 8 And the foolish
said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 9 But the wise
answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you:
but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 10 And while they
went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in
with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 11 Afterward came
also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 12 But he answered
and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"> 13 Watch therefore,
for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man
cometh.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">He is coming again.
He came first to redeem us from our lost condition. He paid a
tremendaous price. But when he returns he is coming as lord of ords
and king of kings.</p>
