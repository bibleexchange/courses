# Justification By Faith
Romans 3:26-31

	## I. Declares God&apos;s Righteousness&mdash;v.26

	How is God Justified in Justifying the Ungodly?
&mdash;Through Substitution&mdash;
			Isaiah 53:5; Galatians 3:13; Hebrews; 2:9; 1 Peter 3:18


## 	II. Excludes Boasting&mdash;v.27

### 1. The Jews Boasted in God&mdash;Romans 2:17

### 2. They Boasted in the Law&mdash;Romans 2:23

The Law was designed to teach sin. It became a means of self-righteousness.

### 3. The Perversion of Religion has made man boastful.

All boasting is excluded&mdash;Ephesians 2:8,9

## III. Harmonizes Law and Faith&mdash;vv.28-31

The dispensations cannot disagree they must harmonize.

### 1. Law was to reveal man&apos;s sin and humble him.

### 2. Faith was to reach out and receive the gift.

Faith does not make void the Law&mdash;it supports/ establishes the Law. v.31
&quot;Establish,&quot; histemi to cause to stand: &mdash; abide, continue, covenant, hold up &mdash;Matthew 5:17

			Views that appear contradictory can both be right.
			Truth is many-sided.
### 3. Apparent Contradiction&mdash;

v.28 &quot;A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the Law.&quot;
James 2:24 &quot;Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.&quot;
To many faith is everything, the practice is nothing.
To believe certain doctrines is not true faith, if the life is not changed.
Faith that does not produce works is dead. This faith cannot save a man.
Paul is dealing with Christians of a Jewish origin. He is emphasizing the necessity of faith in Christ.
Romans 4:3 &quot;Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.&quot;
But remember Abraham&apos;s faith included ACTION. He believed and offered Isaac. James 2:21
Paul believed in faith that justifies&mdash;results in good works.
Romans 6:18; Romans 8:1; Ephesians 2:10; Titus 2:11,12

Good works is the evidence and fruit of faith. James was dealing with the inconsistency that prevailed in his day, which still prevails today.

Faith and works harmonize. &quot;By works was faith made perfect,&quot; James 2:22.
	teleioo, to complete, consummate:&mdash; finish, make perfect.

Paul shows the uselessness of works without faith. James shows the uselessness of faith without works. Both are equally insisting upon the uselessness of profession without practice.

The two sides of this great truth need to be emphasized in our day. On one side a living faith in Jesus Christ alone, in opposition to forms and ceremonies. On the other side, the necessity for a life of practical godliness.
