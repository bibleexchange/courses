# Conformed or Transformed

A sermon outline of Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.

TEXT: Romans 12:1,2

## I. Be Not Conformed to this world

&quot;suschematiz&quot; &ndash; &quot;Sun&quot; union; with or together

association, companionship, resemblance

&quot;schema&quot; &mdash; external condition, fashion, form; to fashion or shape one thing like another.

It has a reference to that which is transitory: changeable, unstable

&quot;this world&quot; : this age

&quot;aion&quot; [GREEK] &mdash; a period of time

Marked by spiritual or moral characteristics.

### 1. &quot;Conformed to the World&quot;

The word &quot;conform&quot; implies that the world is the mold into which the mind is cast.

#### a. The World is Satan&apos;s Kingdom

The world&apos;s customs are determined by the spirit that reigns over it.

> 1 John 5:19&mdash;And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.

#### b. The World is Evil

> 1 John 2:16&mdash;For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.

It is selfish, carnal, earthly minded.

#### c. To Be Conformed to the World

- Is to have the spirit of the world
- Is to be ruled by the world's practices instead of by  what is right and wrong, but what the world calls right.

### 2. The World is the Enemy of God

> James 4:4&mdash;Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

## II. Be Ye transformed

> &quot;It is quite clear that the conformity to the world interferes with our being transformed.&quot;

### 1. We are to be transformed with the image of God

> 2 Corinthians 3:18&mdash;But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 

### 2. Transformed &mdash; &quot;metamorphoo&quot;

transfigure, to change into another form, implying change and form

The word is used to denote the Lord&apos;s transfiguration

### 3. To be transformed is to be made a new creation

> 2 Corinthians 5:17&mdash;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

- In Judgment
- In Our Thoughts
- In Our Affections
- In Our Words
- In Our Actions

### 4. Signs of Being Transformed

Our actions proceed from new principles:

#### a. Obedience to God (1 Samuel 15:22)
#### b. A Desire to Please God (1 Thessalonians 4:1)
#### c. A Love for God, His Word, His Church, and For Prayer

## III. By the Renewing of Your Mind

> Matthew 12:33&mdash;Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. 

The Believer is not merely to be unlike the world, but is to be like Christ.

### 1. There Has to be a Radical Change in the Mind
### 2. The Renewed Mind is the Result of the New Birth
### 3. The New Life Must be Cared For
### 4. A Transfigured Life suggests that the outward life is shaped by the inward life. 

If there is not outward change what evidence is there of an inward change?
