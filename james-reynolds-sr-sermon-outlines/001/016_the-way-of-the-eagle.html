<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Proverbs
30 verse 18 says, ---read verses 18-19.......  Using the phrase there
in verse 19 the first part of that verse “the way of an eagle”,
“the way of an eagle.”  I ask my wife if she would stand and
pray...</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
way of the eagle. In Deuteronomy 32 verses 11-12, Moses under divine
inspiration is singing this song. This 32 chapter is a song and he
has caught the inspiration of this great theme here and in this 11&amp;
12 verse “as an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her
young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, bareth them on her
wings, so the Lord.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">That
is Moses under inspiration of the Spirit of God is comparing the
great eagle and the care of the eagle for its young... in
training...comparing it to God Himself.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
eagle portrays God more than any other bird. There is no reference to
birds in comparison to God throughout the book, but the Bible teaches
us that the eagle is symbolic of God.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Many
things in connection with that, one of them being the beauty and
majesty of the eagle. Now this is a handmade, and I’m sure some of
you realize that this is not an exact replica...but it serves to us a
little to us what the eagle is like.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now
you have to really understand somewhat about the eagle.  It’s a
beautiful bird.  Not only in flight, but its a beauty bird in itself.
 And they tell us that if the bird didn’t have certain elements it
wouldn’t look as majestic, but most eagles, and I see that the
architect or whoever made this didn’t really do justice, but it
makes the eagle, because of that bone structure over the eye...it
makes him look majestic.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Has
anyone ever seen an eagle? Now there are some folks that miss an
eagle and they think sometimes that hawks are eagles.   Reading one
time of a man saying that the folks he was staying
with...”oh...there’s an eagle flying.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
so excitedly, because he liked the eagle he said he went outside and
all to once he seen this big bird flapping its wings, he said,
“that’s not an eagle that’s a hawk.”...Amen, there’s
something majestic about the eagle.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Also
there is the strength of the eagle in battle.  This is why it is
known as the “king of the birds.” Like the lion is known as the
“king of the beasts,” the eagle is known as the “king of
birds.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
majesty or majesticness of the eagle in flight if you ever watched an
eagle soar, and I’ve done that and watched them and I think its the
most beautiful thing just watched them, they don’t’ flap, they
just soar...</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
mastery of the awesome forces of the wind.  No other bird does what
the eagle does.  Now these are all lessons as we get into it you’ll
see as we develop it that we come to this aspect, the compassion. 
There’s no other bird that has such compassion upon its young as
the eagle.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Hawks
and vultures even will hatch their young and go off and leave them,
but not the eagle.  Are you listening?  And so we see here the
All-Seeing Eye. The eyesight is also type of God, Himself and also
these things have to do with the believer.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
first thing is  I have been saying to you as I have annouced this
night after night. An eagle has to be born an eagle.  They don’t
join the eagle family and you can’t make a vulture...though it has
somewhat of distinguishing aspects of the eagle...there is no
comparison...you can’t make a vulture an eagle.  You can’t make a
hawk..though it has some aspects of an eagle...the eagle has to be
born or hatched an eagle.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
‘m saying to you tonite you have to be born an eagle christian. 
You have to be born into this, you don’t join it.  You don’t sign
a log and become a member.  You can take all of the things that
Christians do and often times I think this a failure, because people
say...”well I do all that the Christian does, why am I not a
Christian” ...It matters not  what you try to do to be a
Christian....you have to be “born again.”  You have to be born of
God to have His nature...Can you say, “Amen?”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">So
the eagle being the “King of Birds,” shows to us some tremendous
aspects of the Christian life.  When the Scripture makes reference to
the eagle, it is referring to the “golden eagle” or the “imperial
eagle.”   Now...I won’t take the time to go through all the
different eagles, but there are many.    I think here in our state
they refer to the “bald eagle.”  But throughout Scripture, over
and over again He is referring to these two types of eagles ,  the
golden eagle.  The reason why it is called the “golden eagle”
because after a certian age , it develops a golden crown...dear
God...</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
the “imperial eagle” has strength and that indicates of that
imperial power, that which is in control.  Now speaking of the
“golden eagle,” gold is always a type of Divinity.  Hello?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
Christian is a partaker of the Divine Nature and the more we partake
the more we develop into what God wants us to be.  How many of you
know that just to be a Believer does not does not put you intot the
category of  a close realtionship with Him in Heaven?  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now
I hear this all the time, that anyone thats in the church is going to
be married to Christ....You don’t find that in Scripture, they read
that in there.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
in the eagle is a great example of this.  And so the Believer becomes
a partaker of the nature of God  in new birth, but it doesn’t stop
there.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Peter
says that we become partakers of the nature of God the very
characteristics  of God by these great and precious promises, having
escaped the corruption that is out there in the world ...thank God!!!
 And ah you partook perhaps many years ago but how about tonite..but
how about tonite? .amen....just like the eagle grows, so the believer
has to grow and develop.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
they first hatch, they are nothing but a fuzzy ball, very white,  the
feathers are  very white, very fluffy.  And they remain like that for
several weeks, but  finally they shed that fuziinees and begin to
sprout soem real feathers...Are you lisitnening to me?....Aren’t
you glad that there is a changing and you are not always a babe and
that you dont’have to have someone always bring you meat and
tending to you....Amen, dear God...</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now
the “imperial” is that one that has power and authority.  And the
Scripture tells us that He has given us some power and authority over
the Devil..All ..What’s that?  All. How many believe that?  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This
is why I beleiver the reason God used these two eagles throughout
Scripture, because of the golden nature.  And also  of the imperial
nature, because He wants His Believers to be like Himslef, but also
to have power over al the power of the Enemy.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">How
many of you know that there is difference between “power” and
“authority?”  Now the Bible says that the Devil has “power”,
but He says He gave us “power” and “authority” over all the
“powers” of the Enemy.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
often use this illustration and probably some of you get tired of
hearing it, but it illustrates what I want.  You take an eighteen
wheeler with 40 ton of steel on it going down the road, 60 mph...you
would have to agree that’s some “power.”  Right?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now
if it passes through an area where it  says 35 and he continues to go
60 and a liitle fellow standing the side of the road that has a
little silve thing on his side, and he’s got a whistle in his
mouth.  And this big eighteen wheeler with 40 ton of steel coming 60
mph down the road, thats alot of power.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
this litlle guy he stands there and he  “breeeeee” and you hear
those big ol’ air brakes come on and yuo hear the tires
“screee..each,” that’s “authority.”  And He said He gave us
all “power” and “authority” over the “power” of the
Enemy...Amen!...dear God!!!</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Y’know
we sometimes...I hear Christians say, “I’m afraid what the Devil
is going to...,” ...Listen!!!</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
like what one fella said that was staying with me at the Center, he
came downstairs one morning and he said, you know Brother Reynolds
when I was praying this morning, when I first got up this morning I
heard the devil said “he’s up.”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.....Does
Hell recognize when you get up?  Does Hell get a little bit excited
when you get up?  Or do you get all excited, when the Devil comes
around?  He gave yu all “power” and “authority” over the
“power” of the Enemy.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">...dear
God...we need to undertand the goodness of God.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now
the ealge in flight, solomon uses this and I m sure that  probably
many things that I won’t be able to touch tonite, because you
wouldn’t last that long. but the eagle in flight and here Solomon
said, it was so wonderful, too wonderful for him, there be three
things to wonderful, then he said  four things,  beyond him, and he
begins by saying “the way of an eagle in the air.”  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
studying this , I found out the eagle never leaves it nest or the
dwelling place, because a lot of times before  a nest is ever built
it finds a rock and thats his dwelling , he sits on a rock. And whne
He takes a rock and never changes it.  He chooses it for life....
dear God, would believers find the Rock and hold to it, and let the
Rock hold them! “Amen?</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
in the morning hours, before the eagle ever takes it flight, it will
spend one hour cleaning its wings and oiling them.  It has a special
gland that it secretes oil, for that one purpose.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Now,
in the morning, if you went around where  an eagle is getting ready,
you would see them taking each feather and running its beak
down...its cleaning itself...</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
wonder how many believers that take an hour every morning to make
sure their feathers are clean?  Each feather that goes down and keeps
working  and cleaning itself.   Thank God there is a fountain open in
the house of David, where you can get your feathers clean.  Amen?  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">And
then it begins to oil it feathers because often times eagles go after
fish.  And fish have a tendency to swim.  Don’t find too many out
on the land jumping around.  And so if the eagle would go down and
get involved with that water, if it didn’t oil itself, the water
would make its feathers too heavy, so it couldn’t carry its
prey....Isn’t God something?  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">But
I thougt as I was studying that through, the eagle cleaning itself
and then oiling itself.  Listen!!! We shold never leave home, we
should never begin to face the day without fresh oil from the throne.
 Can you say “Amen?”</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">We
need the oil of the Holy Ghost.  We need the power of God breathing
in us and through us. Amen?  </font>

Remember when we were out  in the boat?  I saw this eagle up there,
you could hardly see it , it was up there so far, it was just a
little speck , and it was kind of soaring around.  I think it was  my
brother  who called my attention to it and I saw, and the next thing
I knew, my brother said, “look at that”, and I looked up just to
see this thing, it came from way out there down and hit that water
and it came up out of there with a great big sucker, that thing must
have been that (i.e very big) long.  Right?  And when he came up out
of there, ...and he was just skimming the water, I mean that thing
was so big...it probably weighed more than he did.  And he just
skimming the water.  But just as soon as he got up, so he got into
that current.....</font></p>

how many of you remember reading about Abraham?  Now that was a
great, old eagle.  He saw the place, he saw the place, he saw the
place afar off.  Calvary was a long way off, but it says he saw the
place afar off.  And Jesus latter on said, “Abraham looked to see
my day and the Scribes and the Pharisees said, ‘you are not 50
years old’” but He said,  “Abraham looked to see my day”...but
when did he see it?  He saw it with those ‘telescopic eyes’, he
could look down the pages of history and see into prophecy, see into
the future, and God wants His believers to see things that the
natural  eye, the carnal eye cant see.  </font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
eyes of the eagle not only can see afar off, but also God has put in
there a fluid that is affected by a magnetic force. Isn’t that...
straight?  And that magnetic force is always affected, or the eagle’s
eyes is always affected by the magnetic pull of the North Pole, just
like a compass.  You take it out, why do men use a compass? Because
it always gives you exact place and God has put into the eagles eye,
so no matter where he goes, he can always designate, find his way
back.  </font>

 A young boy one time, he was out flying a kite and it was a real
cloudy day.  And the kite went way up above the clouds way out of
sight and he is standing there.  And a man came along and said, “son,
what are you doing?” and he says, “I’m flying my kite.” He
says, “you are doing what?” He says, “I’m flying my kite.”
He says, “I don’t see any kite. How do you know there’s a kite
up there?” He says, “ I feel the tug on the line.... I feel the
tug on the line.”...dear God...Does anyone feel the tug on the

the eagle will use one of his eyelids at all time when he is in
flight. Or when he is searching for prey or food. But at times he
wants to soar and soar right into the sun.  He’s the only bird that
can look directly into the sun, because when he focuses in to fly
right into the rays of the sun, he pulls that second eyelid down and
he can look right into the sun.  It’s like sunglasses.  Built in
sunglasses.  You must understand God is a great God.  </font>

eagles diet is so much different from any other bird.  The eagles
diet is the source of its strength.  How many of you have heard the

we eat.  </font>

the eagle does not eat like other birds.  Hawks will find a rabbit

a hawk, a vulture, will not attack something living.  It will circle
around it and wait.    If it sees it is in trouble, it will wait its
time until it is dead.  It likes that which is dead.  Not so with the
eagle....dear God.</font></p>

it chooses its food.  It doesn’t just go flying out and see a fish
down there and attack it or a rabbit.  It decides before it ever
leaves it rock.  It knows what it needs.  It knows what it has a
hankering for.  It might be a fish today.  It might be a rabbit
tomorrow.  It might be a lamb the next day.  It might be a deer.</font></p>

fast as they were going this way.  What happened?  They lost their
strength.  What is it that keeps you going?  Its getting hold of some
food that will fill your soul and make you strong , so that you can
face the currents of life, the rejection, all the things that come
