For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much
more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from
heaven: 26 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath
promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also
heaven. 27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of
those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those
things which cannot be shaken may remain. 28 Wherefore we receiving a
kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may

but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but
evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 9 Then the king
of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son
of Imlah. 10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in
the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied
before them. 11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of
iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push
the Syrians, until thou have consumed them. 12 And all the prophets
prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the
LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand. 13 And the messenger that
was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the
words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let
thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak
that which is good. 14 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the
LORD saith unto me, that will I speak. 15 So he came to the king.
And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead
to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper:
for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 16 And the
king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell
me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD? 17 And he
said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have
not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them
return every man to his house in peace.</p>
