# Bible Introduction

# Introduction: Course Description

This course will be partly introduction and for many bible students partly a review of general information concerning the Bible. We will study peculiarities, origins, structure, meaning, and versions of the Bible.

<span lang="en">As we are giving an overview of the Bible, we will mainly consider general facts concerning the Scriptures. Much more time and study will be given in other courses to dig into the wealth and depth of Scripture. Because there is not "one size fits all" when it comes to teaching, each Bible Student will find they already know some things and other things never heard. Even the things heard, maybe you have forgotten and this course will serve as a good review for you that are somewhat familiar with the Bible and will serve as an introduction for those of you who are not so familiar. No matter what your familiarity with Scripture, I am sure you can glean from information given in this study.</span>

## Old Testament books of the Bible

The books within each testament are also grouped according to a type. For example, the first 5 books of the Bible are "The Law" or the "Torah". The Greek title for these first 5 books is "Pentateuch" which means "5 scrolls or books".

### The Law / Torah / Pentateuch: 

	Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy

1. Genesis

Genesis answers two big questions: “How did God’s relationship with the world begin?” and “Where did the nation of Israel come from?”

God saves Israel from slavery in Egypt, and then enters into a special relationship with them.

3. Leviticus

God gives Israel instructions for how to worship Him.

 	Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther

6. Joshua

Joshua (Israel’s new leader) leads Israel to conquer the Promised land, then parcels out territories to the twelve tribes of Israel.

7. Judges

Israel enters a cycle of turning from God, falling captive to oppressive nations, calling out to God, and being rescued by leaders God sends their way (called “judges”).

9. 1 Samuel

Israel demands a king, who turns out to be quite a disappointment.

10. 2 Samuel

David, a man after God’s own heart, becomes king of Israel.

11. 1 Kings

The kingdom of Israel has a time of peace and prosperity under King Solomon, but afterward splits, and the two lines of kings turn away from God.

12. 2 Kings

Both kingdoms ignore God and his prophets, until they both fall captive to other world empires.

13. 1 Chronicles

This is a brief history of Israel from Adam to David, culminating with David commissioning the temple of God in Jerusalem.

14. 2 Chronicles

David’s son Solomon builds the temple, but after centuries of rejecting God, the Babylonians take the southern Israelites captive and destroy the temple.

15. Ezra

18. Job

Satan attacks a righteous man named Job, and Job and his friends argue about why terrible things are happening to him.

20. Proverbs

A collection of sayings written to help people make wise decisions that bring about justice.

21. Ecclesiastes

A philosophical exploration of the meaning of life—with a surprisingly nihilistic tone for the Bible.

 1. The Bible Is… ### <span lang="en">The Bible is God's written Revelation of His will to men.</span>

<span lang="en">God wrote no other book than the Bible. There is no other physical evidence of the details of God's will and His person than the Bible. Only by reading the Bible can we be sure of so many questions regarding God.</span>

#### <span lang="en">Who is God?</span>

#### <span lang="en">What is God like?</span>

#### <span lang="en">What does God want?</span>

#### <span lang="en">What is God's plan?</span>

#### <span lang="en">Why does God do what He does?, Etc.</span>

<span lang="en">In the Bible, God has provided the details of His will and the expression of His love for humanity. All other supposed revelation must harmonize with this great Book. The Holy Bible is the standard for all life--temporal and eternal!</span>

### <span lang="en">The Bible is all about Salvation through Jesus Christ.</span>

<span lang="en">The Bible's central theme is salvation through Jesus Christ. ("central" main, chief, basic theme - a topic, as of a lecture.)</span>

### <span lang="en">The Bible is Translated Today from Much Older Languages</span>

<span lang="en">The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew (with a small percentage in Aramaic.) The New Testament was originally written in Greek. The English King James Version is a translation from these original languages. To "translate" means to change from one language to another.</span>

### <span lang="en">The Bible is ONE</span>

<span lang="en">The Bible is one book, one history, and one story--HIS STORY \[God's Story\]! We call it the HOLY Bible because it is God's Word and not merely the story of men. The word HOLY means sacred, pure, blameless, or religious, consecrated. The Bible is a divine book yet God used people to express His Divine truths. Holy men (human element) wrote as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost (Divine element). Because it is God's Word, we cannot dispose of one book or passage of the Bible.</span>

<span lang="en">The Bible has 66 books, 39 in the OT and 27 in the NT. The Divine revelation of the Bible moves smoothly from the beginning in Genesis to its ending in Revelation. Genesis is a book of origins; Revelation is a book of endings. The books of the Bible in-between are God's redeeming words to a wrecked, ruined world. Each book of the Bible has its own message, yet in its entirety a complete message of salvation to man can be seen.</span>


 2. Names of the Bible ### <span lang="en">Holy Bible</span>

The actual word bible appears nowhere within the text of the Bible. The word bible comes to us from the Greek word biblios which means "books". The word biblios was originally used to refer to the papyrus reed used in the making of ancient paper. The English word bible means "books". The Holy Bible refers to the collection of Holy books. ### <span lang="en">The Bible's Names for Itself</span>

#### <span lang="en">The Book</span>

> <span lang="en">Genesis 5:1--This is the book of the generations of Adam.</span>

> <span lang="en">Psalm 40:7--Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, (Heb. 10:7)</span>

> <span lang="en">Matthew 1:1--The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</span>

> <span lang="en">Luke 4:17--And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,</span>

#### <span lang="en">Testament</span>

<span lang="en">The word testament means covenant or agreement. The Bible books under the old covenant are called the Old Testament and the Bible books under the new covenant are called the New Testament.</span>

> <span lang="en">II Corinthians 3:14--But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.</span>

> <span lang="en">II Corinthians 3:6--;Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</span>

#### <span lang="en">Scripture</span>

<span lang="en">The word scripture means "writings". This word is used to refer to sacred writings, and is usually used in connection with the Bible. Jesus refers to the writings of the prophet Isaiah as the Scripture (Lk. 4:21). Jesus questions the chief priests and elders: "Did ye never read in the Scriptures…" (Mt. 21:42) Jesus again used this word when talking to the Sadducces: "Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God". (Mt. 22:29) Other references: Lk. 24:27, Rom. 1:2, Rom. 15:4, II Tim. 3:15-16; I Peter 1:20</span>

#### <span lang="en">The Word of God</span>

<span lang="en">This is the most significant, powerful, and complete name for the Holy Bible. The Bible is the God's written and recorded word to man. The Bible is not the word of man. The Bible is the Word of God. References: Mk. 7:13, Rom. 10:17, II Cor. 2:17.</span>

> <span lang="en">Hebrews 4:12--;For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</span>


 3. Purpose of the Bible # <span lang="en">The Purpose of the Bible</span>

## <span lang="en">The Bible was written that men might believe, understand, know, love, and follow Christ.</span>

### <span lang="en">That men might believe that Jesus is the Christ. The main theme of the Bible is redemption through Jesus Christ. The word christ means "the anointed one", and refers to the Messiah. Men need to believe that Jesus is the Savior. The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes. (Rom. 1:16)</span>

> <span lang="en">John 20:31--But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</span>

### <span lang="en">That men might understand who Christ is. Jesus reveals Himself through His Word. The Bible tells us that the Scriptures testify of Jesus. Men need to understand through the Word that Jesus is the messiah; He is the savior and the only source of Salvation.</span>

> <span lang="en">John 5:39--Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</span>

### <span lang="en">That men might know Christ. The Bible helps men to know Christ. The songwriter stated, "I'm glad I know who Jesus is!" Paul desired to know Christ in a greater way. Christians can know who Jesus is, and also know Him in a personal way sharing fellowship with Him.</span>

> <span lang="en">John 17:3--And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</span>

### <span lang="en">That men might love Christ. According to the Scripture, in order for a man to love Christ he must keep the Words of Christ which are contained in the Bible. We need to study the Bible so that we can obey the Word of God and love Jesus.</span>

> <span lang="en">John 14:23--…a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him…</span>

> <span lang="en">I John 2:5--But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected…</span>

### <span lang="en">That men might follow Christ. The word Christian means "one who follows Christ." The Bible was written that men might follow Christ.</span>

> <span lang="en">John 10:27--My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</span>

> <span lang="en">John 12:26--If any man serve me, let him follow me…</span>

## <span lang="en">The Bible reveals the purpose and plan of God.</span>

### <span lang="en">Concerning Salvation. The Bible explains that salvation is received through faith in Jesus and reveals man's need of salvation.</span>

> <span lang="en">John 3:16--For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span>

### <span lang="en">Concerning the Church. The plan of God for His Church is that she should be glorious, holy and without blemish. There is much instruction given to the Church in the Bible.</span>

> <span lang="en">Ephesians 5:27--That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span>

### <span lang="en">Concerning the last days. The Bible reveals God's plan for the last days. We understand from the Bible that we are living in the last days and God gave us warning of what would come to pass in these last days.</span>

> <span lang="en">II Timothy 3:1--This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</span>

## <span lang="en">The Bible is God's written Word to man.</span>

### <span lang="en">1. It is a sure Word of prophecy. The Bible is the infallible Word of God. It does not merely contain God's Word, but is God's Word. The Bible is a sure word in a dark hour.</span>

> <span lang="en">II Peter 1:19-21--For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; where unto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</span>

### <span lang="en">It is a solid foundation. (I Cor. 3:11) The Word of God is a solid foundation of our faith. Jesus is the Rock of our salvation. Jesus is the Word that became flesh. When everything else is sinking; the Word of God will not fail.</span>

> <span lang="en">I Corinthian 3:11--For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span>

### <span lang="en">It is the infallible, inspired Word of God. The word inspiration means "God breathed." There is life in the Word which is the very breath of God. God's Word is without error or contradiction.</span>

> <span lang="en">II Timothy 3:16--All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</span>

## <span lang="en">The Bible is the final authority.</span>

### <span lang="en">1. Preaching and teaching must be founded upon God's Word. (II Tim. 4:2) Paul told Timothy to preach the Word. The Word is the foundation for our faith. (Rom. 10:17) What we believe and preach must be in harmony with the Bible.</span>

### <span lang="en">Every question must be settled with the Word of God. The Bible must be the absolute authority in every area of question in the lives of men. The authority of the Word of God must never be questioned by the saint of God. This is why we need to know beyond all doubt that we have the Word of God today.</span>


 4. Comparison of the Old and New Testaments ![](/uploads/images/gallery/2022-09/bookshelf.gif)## <span lang="en">OLD TESTAMENT &amp; NEW TESTAMENT: COMPARED</span>

### <span lang="en">Both begin with Divinity.</span>

#### <span lang="en">The Old Testament begins with God. -- Genesis 1:1</span>

#### <span lang="en">The New Testament begins with Christ. -- Matthew 1:1</span>

### <span lang="en">Both share the same theme.</span>

#### <span lang="en">Salvation through Jesus Christ is the central theme of both Testaments.</span>

<span lang="en">Romans 1:16; I Peter 1:10; Isaiah 56:1; 59:17</span>

#### <span lang="en">The Old Testament looks forward by faith to the cross. Redemption through the blood of Jesus was God's plan for the Old Testament, and is God's plan for the New Testament.</span>

> <span lang="en">Revelation 13:8--And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</span>

<span lang="en">The plan of God since the beginning of time was for Jesus who is the Lamb of God to shed His Divine Blood to purchase our salvation.</span>

#### <span lang="en">The New Testament looks back at the finished work of the cross.</span>

### <span lang="en">Both center on Christ.</span>

#### <span lang="en">The Old Testament is full of prophecies of Christ. These are called Messianic Prophecies. The Old Testament contains many shadows and types that point to Christ. The law is a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. -- Gal. 3:24 Christ is the fulfilling of the law. (Galatians 3:24; Romans 10:4)</span>

> <span lang="en">Matthew 5:17--Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</span>

##### <span lang="en">Christ is the predominant person of the New Testament. Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant. -- Heb. 12:24 (Heb. 8:6; 9:15)</span>


 5. Old Testament Overview # <span lang="en">O.T. Overview</span>

 ![](/assets/bible-introduction/otOverview.gif)> <span lang="en">Psalm 119:105 -- Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</span>

> <span lang="en">A thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education. -Theodore Roosevelt</span>

## Sections

1. [The Bible is One](#bkmrk-)
2. [Theme of the Bible is Redemption](#bkmrk--0)

## <span id="bkmrk-"></span>1. Perfect Unity of the Bible: The Bible is One

## The Bible is without contradiction.

There is no error in the Bible. The Bible is the infallible Word ofGod. God's Word is without error or contradiction. The Bible is accurate and complete. The Bible is historically and scientifically accurate. There is no contradiction between true science and the Bible. True historical record andArcheological record are in complete agreement with the Bible.

There is complete harmony in the Bible itself. What has been written in one part of the Bible will be in agreement with what has been written in another part of the Bible. There is total unity within the Bible itself.

## The Bible is One in Prophecy

The OT contains much prophecy. Prophecy is a declaration of something to come. It is history written in advance. All of these prophecies are in agreement with each other. Some of the OT prophesies have been fulfilled at a later date within the OT. Many OT prophesies were describing the coming of theMessiah.

The NT fulfils much of the OT prophesy. The prophecies are fulfilled in great detail confirming their accuracy. The prophetic note in every book is consistent with that in all the others.

## The Bible is One in Doctrine

Doctrine is the fundamental truths of the Bible arranged in systematic form. The truths of the Bible remain the same throughout the Word of God. There is perfect unity of Doctrine in the Bible. This unity is carried through from the Old to the New Testament. The Bible is the complete written revelation to man with perfect harmony of every doctrine and truth.

The Bible is a perfect union of truth. Truth does not change. Webster's Dictionary defines truth as : Conformity to fact or reality; "exact accordance with that which is, or has been, or shall be." The Bible truths remain the same from Genesis to Revelation.

> John 17:17--Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

## The Bible is One in Purpose.

The purpose of the Bible is to reveal God's will to man. The Bible reveals God's plan throughout the ages. The Word gives instruction and guidance to the souls of men. The plan of redemption is revealed to man in the Bible.

Each Book of the Bible heralds the one purpose of the Bible. God has revealed His will to different people at different times throughout the Bible.The entire Bible directs men to Christ and the plan of redemption which is the central theme of the Bible.

## The Bible is One in Structure.

Each Testament is composed of three main divisions -- history,instruction, and prophecy.

There is but one Bible composed of both New and Old Testaments.

The New is in the Old contained; the Old is by the New explained; The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is by the New revealed; The New is in the Old foreshown; the Old is in the New full-grown.

All of this intricate complexity of the Bible in content and design, with its cohesion, unanimity, and mutual confirmation, would be remarkable and impressive enough had it been achieved by a group of scholars working in close collaboration with constant interchange of information and ideas. Even under such conditions, with each writer's assigned portion edited by a master mind and approved by the group at large, the composite unity of the Scriptures would be a phenomenal achievement. BUT, theBible was not written that way! It was composed by forty or more writers who lived over a period of at least sixteen hundred years in about thirteen different countries and on three continents, and who wrote from vastly different backgrounds and experiences. They were shepherds, kings, soldiers,princes, priests, fishermen, scholars, historians, professional men, and common laborers. Their work was done in fields, deserts, caves, palaces, prisons,ships, and homes. They wrote on manifold subjects in many styles and at least three languages. And yet, in spite of such diversities and difficulties their heterogeneous works fit together with unfailing precision and uniformity,obviously designed one for the other.

## <span id="bkmrk--0"></span>2. Perfect Unity of the Bible: Redemption

Redemption is the main theme of the Bible.

## Redemption is the action of purchasing or paying in full.

Man has been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ. Jesus has paid the price in full with His shed blood upon the cross for the salvation of man. Salvation through the blood of Jesus is the main theme of the Bible. This theme can be found from Genesis to Revelation. The first promise of redemption is given in Gen. 3:15.

> Genesis 3:15--And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

This is a prophecy that The Messiah who would come from the seed of the woman would one day bruise the head of the serpent. The theme continues to the Book of Revelation.

> Revelation 5:9--And they sung a new song,saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred,and tongue, and people, and nation;

This Scripture refers to the resurrected Christ who redeemed us by his blood.

## Christ the Redeemer is the main Person of the Bible.

The blood sacrifices in the OT were a type of Jesus who is the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world. "Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing." (Rev. 5:12) The OT looks forward by faith to the cross of Christ. The Gospels portray Christ and His death upon the cross. The NT looks back upon the finished work of the cross.

Christ manifests Himself in the OT at different times in various ways. Christ is portrayed in type and in prophecy as the coming Messiah.

### From Adam to Abraham we see the beginning of the human race. 

Genesis 1:26, 27; 4:1; 5:1-5, 32; 6:9,10; 7:17-23; 9:1; 11:10, 27

Genealogy - a recorded history of one's ancestry, the study of family descent.

### From Abraham to Christ we see the beginning of a chosen race. The Hebrew nation. 

Genesis 12:1, 2; 22:15-18; 32:9-12; Joshua 1:1-3; Matthew 1:1,2, 16

(The nation was founded &amp; nurtured by God in order to bring the man into the world.)

### From Christ on we see the beginning of the church. 

Matthew 16:18; Acts 2:47; 11:26

> We trace His image on each page In holy letters lined with light; Redeemer, Prophet, Priest, and Sage-- Who finds His presence reads aright.

<span id="bkmrk-"></span>## 1. Inspiration: Definition

### a. What is meant by the term inspiration?

#### Webster's dictionary defines inspiration as: The act of breathing into anything.

#### The word inspiration is derived from the Latin in spiro meaning to â€˜breathe in'.

#### The word inspiration literally means God breathed

> 2 Timothy 3:16--All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.

The phrase given by inspiration of God is translated from the one Greek word: theopneustos, which is derived from Theos - God and pneumaThe Holy Ghost. Pneumais derived from a word that means breath. The literal translation of this phrase (given by inspiration of God) is: **GOD BREATHED.**

### b. The word inspiration is used in reference to the Divine origin of the Scriptures.

The Bible was not just written by the mind and hand of man. The Holy Ghost breathed the Word into the men who were the human tools of the Divine Author.

> II Peter 1:21--For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost

The prophecy in this context refers back to verse 20 which says: Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. These verses refer to the prophecy contained in the Scripture. The Scripture did not come to us by man. The men were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. This Divine action of God moving upon man to give them the Word is what is meant by inspiration.

Do we have an inspired Word of God?Yes, we do! But, simply answering yes to this question is certainly not enough. Every Believer must know beyond all doubt that their Bible is none other than the breath of the Almighty God. (2 Samuel 23:2; Acts 1:16; Mark12:36)

All Scripture is excellent inspirit, beautiful in language and grand in prophetic imagery, but its superiority is not in natural talents nor is Scripture words of mere human invention, but its excellence lies in the fact its **words are breathed byGod.**

(Heb. 3:7,8,15; John 13:18,21; Hab. 3:2,16; Isa. 51:16;59:21; Jer. 1:9; 5:14; 20:9; 23:18-19,22,29)

<span id="bkmrk--0"></span>## 2. Inspiration: Declarations

## The entire Bible is inspired of God.

> II Timothy3:16--All scripture is given by inspiration of Godâ€¦

**The view that the Bible in its entirety is inspired of God is called plenary inspiration.**Plenary means full or complete. The Complete Bible from Genesis to Revelation is the inspired Word of God. All Scripture is equally inspired.

Because it is inspired of God,the Bible is infallible. Infallible means to be totally exempt from the possibility of mistake. This word is applied to God who is not capable of error or mistake. Used in reference to the Bible, infallible refers to theDivine Authorship of Scripture. The Divine Author is infallible and thereforeHis Word is infallible.

## TheOld Testament is inspired by God.

Over and over again we can find the following phrases in the Old Testament:

"Word of the Lord"

"God said/spake"

"God commanded"

 "God appeared"

"the Lord said/spake"

"thus saith the Lord"

These phrases affirm the inspiration of the Old Testament. The validity of these claims of inspiration is evident from the minuteness and detail as to names, times, and places which characterized their messages, and from the exact literal fulfillment of their prophecies.

> Acts 28:25--And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,

> 2 Peter 1:21--For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost

> Hebrews 1:1--God,who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,

> Dt.18:18-22--v.22 **When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not,nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.**

## TheNew Testament is inspired by God

The writers of the NT claim inspiration for OT writers as well as for themselves:

> Acts 1:16--â€¦this scripture must needs have been fulfilled,which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus..,

## The Men were Inspired

 The Scripture declares that Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. -- 2 Peter 1:21 God breathed His Word through the men that were the human instruments to write the Bible. The prophet"s spoken words from God were used by God to communicate with His people. The Lord instructed many of these men to write down His Words. The men were inspired and instructed by God to give His Word to the people.

1 Thessalonians2:13; John 6:63; Eph. 3:8-9

## The Words were Inspired

Not only were the men inspired by God, but the very choice of words came straight from the throne of God. God inspired the choice of the words of Scripture. **This is referred to as verbal inspiration.** The writers were not left absolutely to themselves in the choice of words that they should use. God guided the very wording of the Bible.

> Jude 17--But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of ourLord Jesus Christ;

> 2 Peter 3:2--That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets,and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour

> John 12:48--He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.

## The Letters were Inspired

The very letters of the words of the Bible are Divinely inspired. For example, let us look at the doctrine of"one seed and not many" through Christ which is established by the use of a single letter: "s."

> Galatians 3:16--Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.\[comp. Gen.22:16-18\]

The "s" in this verse makes ALL the difference. The "s" makes the difference between singularity and plurality and most important the difference of stating that there is one mediator or stating there are many mediators. Had God said "seeds" instead of "seed" the promises could have come through Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed, the Pope or anyone else that chose this claim of fame. By definite use of singularity, God closes the door on false messengers and exalts Christ as the ONLY way to God. The promised seed could only be Christ and not Christ and Buddha or Christ and Mohammed. Jesus Christ alone was and is the promised seed.

## Every Iota was Inspired

> Matthew 5:18--For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

A jot could be equalled by an apostrophe (') and a tittle equalled by a hyphen (-).

"The Bible is none other than the voice of Him that sitteth on the throne. Every book of it, every chapter, every verse, every word, every syllable, every letter is the direct utterance of TheMost High."--Dan Burgon

<span id="bkmrk--1"></span>## 3. Inspiration: Definite Proofs

There are crystal clear proofs of the inspiration of the Bible. Besides the declarations of the text itself, multitudes of Biblical facts indicate that Scripture was Divinely inspired.

## Its Unbroken and Perfect Unity

The Bible contains 66 books written by approximately 40 different men in four languages spanning a period of 1600 years, by men living as far as 1500 miles apart. The men used were from all walks of life; they were kings, doctors,prophets, shepherds, servants, fisherman, and even a tax collector. Yet there is unbroken and perfect unity throughout the entire Bible. This could only be the work of God.

## Its Fearless Foretelling

 The Bible foretells events many years and even centuries before they took place. The timing of the writing of the Old Testament prophecies can be historically documented because an accurate record of the history between theTestaments has survived. This historical record confirms the date of the ending of the Old Testament placing a four hundred year biblical silence between the last of O.T. prophecy and the start of N.T. fulfillments. The dates when the Bible books were written can be historically documented. TheSeptuagint, which is a Greek translation of the Old Testament, can be accurately placed at least two-hundred and fifty years before the birth ofChrist. Since the Greek Septuagint was translated from the Hebrew text there had to have been the Hebrew Old Testament in existence at least two-hundred and fifty years before the New Testament. This is historical proof that these prophecies were written hundreds of years in advance of their detailed fulfillment in the New Testament. There is no possible way that man could have made such accurate predictions. This is a definite and inarguable proof of theInspiration of Scripture.

EXAMPLES OF ACCURATELY FULFILLED PROPHECY:

### The Prophecies of Christ

He would be of the seed of Abraham -- Gen. 22:18 -- Mt. 1:1

He would be a descendant of David -- Jer. 23:5 -- Mt. 1:1

He would come from the tribe of Judah -- Micah 5:2 -- Mt. 1:2, Heb. 7:14

He would be born in Bethlehem -- Micah 5:2 -- Mt. 2:1

There were 29 prophesies fulfilled in one day during the events of the crucifixion ofJesus which were accurately predicted in great detail centuries before His death.

There are over 300 Messianic prophecies that were fulfilled in Christ.

> Acts 3:18--But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.

Jesus fulfilled all the O.T. prophecies concerning Him despite improbability. No man is able to choose his lineage before he is born, yetJesus was born exactly according to the lineage as prophesied. There were other people involved in the fulfillments of these prophecies such as the Roman soldiers who parted Jesus garments among them and cast lots for His robe. Even the darkness that took place at the death of Christ can be historically documented and verified. The prophet Amos foretold of this darkness approximately 700 years before it occurred. There is no human explanation as to the accurate fulfillment of these Messianic prophecies. **This is a clear proof of the inspiration of the Bible!**

### The Prophecies of Israel

Moses prophesied of the future of Israel. -- Deut. 4:23-38.

They would become captives because of their sin. --Is. 22:17, Jer.20:6.

They would be scattered into all lands. -- Deut. 30:1-3.

They would be persecuted. -- Lk. 19:41-44.

Preceding the time of Christ"s return, Israel would be gathered again to her own land. (Luke 21:29-32; Eze. 36-37) This was fulfilled May 14,1948.

Ezekiel 36:24--For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

God stated that He would watch over the people of Israel like a shepherd (Jeremiah 31:10). Less than 24 hours after Israel declared independence in 1948, its surrounding countries (Egypt,Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon) attacked Israel, hoping to replace the Jewish state with an Arab state. These countries are much larger than Israel, but tinyIsrael prevailed in that war and was able to capture additional land! Israel also prevailed in two other major wars that followed (Six-Day War, 1967 and YomKippur War, 1973).

### The Prophecies of Nations

Babylon was overthrown and brought down like Sodom as prophesied (Isa. 13:19; Jer.51:37). Daniel 5 describes the transfer of power to the Medes and Persians.

The Grecian Empire was the third kingdom described in the prophetic dream in Daniel2:39 with Babylon being the first Kingdom. Alexander the Great conquered the world exactly as was foretold in this prophecy. (This prophetic dream is studied in depth in the 3rd year Prophecy course.)

The division of the Roman Empire is also foretold in the division of the legs of the same image in Nebuchadnezzar"s dream in Daniel 2.

Nineveh was laid waste by fierce nomadic peoples. Nahum (1-3, 3:7) foretold that the gates would be set wide open to thine enemies (3:13). The Tigris river flooded at the time of the attack and washed away much of the walls including the gates of the city.

Tyre was to be destroyed according to Ezekiel 26:3-14. This is a very specific prophecy given approximately 588 BC. The Scripture declares that many nations would come against Tyre. v. 3. God said he would bring the king of Babylon against them. v.7. The prophecy states that the stones, the timber and the dust would be cast into the water. v. 12. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did lay siege to Tyre for thirteen years. Alexander the Great took the city ofTyre on the Island in 332 BC by building a land bridge to the Island. They used stones, timber from the destroyed buildings and earthen fill to make what is called a mole (earthen bridge) in the water. The soldiers put the stones,timber, and dust into the water exactly according to the prophecy. This specific fulfilled event is beyond the mere speculation of man. The Bible is the inspired Word of God. The mole of Alexander the Great is still in existence today.

Jesus foretold of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. -- Mt. 24:1-2, Mk.13:1-3. The city of Jerusalem was destroyed in AD 70 under the Roman GeneralTitus. The temple was burned and the gold melted between the stones. The soldiers literally took apart the Temple stone by stone to retrieve the gold. Again the prophecy was fulfilled in detail exactly as Jesus said it would be.

### The Prophecies of the Last Days

2Timothy 3:1-9--v. 1 This know also, that in the last daysâ€¦

 There are numerous accurate descriptions of the last days found inScripture. These are just some of the prophecies that describe the condition of our day:

An increase of knowledge -- Dan. 12:4

 Think of all the new innovations that have taken place within the last one hundred years. The Wright brothers " first flight was in 1903 and today air travel is a common mode of transportation. There has been so much advancement in technology in a very short time.

Many false prophets -- Mt. 24:5,11

Wars and rumors of wars -- Mt. 24:6

Famines, pestilences and earthquakes -- Mt. 24:7

Iniquity shall abound -- Mt. 24:12

Gospel preached in the entire the world -- Mt. 24:14

Eating, drinking and marrying -- Mt. 24:38

As it was in the days of Lot -- Luke 17: 28-29

(They drank, bought, sold, planted and built. This sounds a lot like the people today. There is also a rise of the sin of homosexuality today as it was in the days of Lot.)

A departing from the faith -- I Tim. 4:1

## Its Historical Accuracy

Archaeology is about learning about the past by finding things that were used by ancient peoples. These ancient artifacts tell us information about the people that used them. There have been many archaeological finds that support the historical accuracy of the Bible. As a matter of fact, no archaeological find has yet to contradict the Bible. Critics have argued that the Bible is not historically accurate, yet archaeology continues to validate the Bible as true.

A Hittite library was discovered in Turkey in 1906 confirming the accuracy of the Biblical record of the Hittite people.

There have been skeletons found of giant people confirming the description of giants in the Bible.

The remains of a crucifixion victim were found in Jerusalem in 1968. The victim"s feet had one nail hole that penetrated through both feet and one nail hole in each of the lower arms. The man was believed to have been executed by the Romans in the Jewish uprising of AD 70. This confirms that crucifixion was indeed a means of execution used by the Romans as described in the Biblical account of the crucifixion of Jesus.

The Book of Acts has been confirmed to be historically accurate.

There have been inscriptions found containing the names of people described in the Bible in the locations the Bible places the people in.

There have been many archaeological finds that continue to confirm the historical accuracy of the Bible. This is more evidence that testifies to the inspiration of Scripture.

## Its Scientific Accuracy

The Bible is scientifically accurate. There are things described in theBible that the men that wrote them would have no way of knowing. God is the author of Scripture and knows all things.

The descriptions in the Bible are true and scientifically accurate.

The dimensions of Noah"s Ark given to Noah by God are in perfect proportion for a most seaworthy vessel. Modern vessels that have been designed with advanced understanding of physics and the use of computer technology use the same proportions that Noah did. There is no way that Noah could have had access to this knowledge. The only logical conclusion is to believe theBiblical account that God give these dimensions to Noah.

The book of Job refers to the parting of light. Job 38:24 Light can be separated into parts with a prism. There is no way that Job which is the oldest book in the Bible could have known that light can be divided.

Ecclesiastes refers to the circuits of the wind. There are wind currents and patterns that have been discovered by modern science with the aid of satellites and computers. The men of the O.T. times would not have had access to such information, yet again the Bible accurately refers to the circuits of the wind.

How did the writer of Ecclesiastes know that the rivers run into the sea.--Eccl. 1:7

Isaiah spoke of God sitting upon the circle of the earth. Is. 40:22. The earth was not proven to be round until Magellan"s expedition sailed around the world in the 1500"s. Isaiah did not have access to such information. This again is a testimony to the Inspiration of Scripture.

## Its Peerless Power

Romans 1:16--For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

The Bible is more than just a book. The Bible is the Word of God. TheBible was written by Holy men of God moved upon by the Holy Ghost. The Bible is to be understood by the Holy Ghost moving upon you. Those who earnestly read the Bible in faith can be changed by the power of God. God can use the Bible to change men"s lives.

Bible critics attack the Bible and its contents. They claim there is no "historical Jesus", "reliable science affirms evolution and discounts creation", and "the Bible is just man's writings with no greater value than any other writing of men.

## It produces "Born Again" Men.

The minister did not come that morning; he was snowed up, I suppose. At last, a very thin-looking man, a shoemaker, or tailor, or something of that sort, went up into the pulpit to preach.

## It produces spiritual growth.

The Bible produces spiritual growth in the lives of the saints of God. The Bible is the spiritual food of theChristian and must be read daily for Christian strength and growth.

## It cleanses the life.

The Bible can cleanse the lives of men and women. The Holy Ghost will convict men through the Word. The Bible will reveal to men what needs to be changed in their lives. The laver in the Tabernacle is a symbol of the Word of God. The priests were required to wash in the laver every time they came into the service of the Lord.

<span id="bkmrk--2"></span>## 5. Inspiration: Deceptive Views

## The Bible was produced by natural inspiration.

This false view holds that theBible is the product of genius of a high order, but not supernatural, orDivine. This is the type of inspiration that Milton, Shakespeare, or Confucius show in their writings. No man of intelligence, however, can go from readingShakespeare to reading the Bible without feeling that the difference between the two is more than just by degree. A book can be inspiring without being inspired. The Bible far supersedes the books of men.

## God used levels of inspiration to give us the Bible.

This false view claims thatGod used different levels of control at different times in the process of inspiration. This view advocates that sometimes God used Divine inspiration and at other times, God only offered suggestions or promptings of instruction.

This is totally contrary to true Biblical inspiration.

## God only gave the concepts or thoughts to the men who wrote the Bible.

Those who promote this false view advocate that only concepts or thoughts were given by inspiration. This position leaves the wording of the text to the minds of men. This again is contrary to the correct meaning of true Biblical inspiration.

## Only portions of the Bible are inspired.

This is a dangerous false doctrine referred to as partial inspiration. This position states that the Bible contains the Word of God, but is not all of Scripture is inspired. Who then decides what is and what is not inspired? Such a theory leaves man in awful and fatal uncertainty.

## What is the correct understanding of the inspiration of the Bible?

"Verbal and plenary inspiration" is the correct view. (Will be explained in greater detail next)# Chapter 4: Canonization of the Bible

## <span id="bkmrk-"></span> 1. Definition of Canon

# <span lang="en">Definition of Canonization</span>

The process of the Bible books being gathered together into their current form is what is meant by: Canonization of the Bible. This process did not happen overnight. Remember that each individual book had to be laboriously copied by hand. The books were used and distributed by the religious leaders of the day. There were also other books written that claimed inspiration that were not included as part of our Bible. There were religious and historical books that were also in distribution at the time of this process of judging which books should be included into the Canon. This process of recognizing which books were inspired and which books were not is what we will study in this section. We will try to answer the question: How did the Bible come into its present form?

## The word Canon comes from the root word reed .

The reed was used as a measuring device. The English word is cane and the Greek word is kanon . The word canon means a rod, rule or measuring device. 3rd century church leader Origen used the word canon to refer to the rule of faith.

## The word Canon refers to the books that were judged to be of Divine origin.

### The Biblical canon is the inspired books that have been collected together in the Holy Bible. Remember the word Bible means books and the Holy Bible is a collection of Holy books. The word Canon is simply the word that is used to refer to this collection of Holy books that we call the Bible which is the inspired Word of God.

### The Old Testament Canon refers to the Old Testament books that were judged to be divinely inspired and included in the part of the Bible we call the Old Testament.

### The New Testament Canon refers to the New Testament books that were judged to be divinely inspired and included in the part of the Bible we call the New Testament.

## Canonization is the process of placing writings in the Biblical canon.

### The Divine Author gave the Scriptures to Holy men of God.

### The manuscripts were carefully copied by hand.

### The books were not collected together in their current form immediately.

### The Jewish scribes and religious leaders gathered the books together that were judged to be of Divine origin into the Old Testament Canon.

### The early church leaders gathered the books together that were judged to be of Divine origin into the New Testament Canon.

##  Canonicity refers to the fact that a book has been judged to be of Divine origin and has been included in the Canon.

### Example: The Canonicity of the Book of Isaiah was recognized because it was deemed to be inspired by God.

### Canonization in this context should not be confused with the Roman Catholic usage referring to the process of making dead people saints.

## <span id="bkmrk--0"></span> 2. Description of Canonization

```
<h1><span lang="en">Description of Canonization</span></h1>
<h2>The Old Testament Canon was divided into three categories.</h2> 

```

### The Law â€" the writings of Moses.

### The Prophets â€" the writings of men who held the office of a prophet.

### The Writings â€" with the exception of Ruth and Lamentations the writingsof men who did not hold the office of a prophet. This section is also referredto as the Hagiographa in many of the Jewish texts.

## TheMasoretic Text (MT)

### The word masoretic means traditional . Masoretic Text refers to the traditionally accepted Hebrew Scriptures. The Masoretic Textswere originally controlled by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes.

### The MT is the authoritative text of the 24 books of the Jewish canon ( Tanakh or Hebrew Bible ) complete with explanatory, grammar, pronunciation and spelling notations and significant textual details. (i. , the total number of letters on a given page could be found noted in the margin of a MasoreticText. )

### The goal of the Masoretes was to wholly preserve the very form, words and meaning of the Scriptures. Any loss or change at all was inexcusable.

## TheHebrew Scriptures were preserved by the priests.

### It was a priestly duty to preserve the written revelation of theScriptures. The priests were the divinely appointed guardians and teachers ofthe Law.

> Deuteronomy31:24-26--And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded theLevitesâ€¦ Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.

The law was placed in the charge of the priests to be kept by them alongside the Ark of the Covenant. The priests were also commanded to read the law every seven years.

### The priests oversaw the task of making correct copies of the law for the use of kings and rulers.

## Great care was taken to protect and preserve the inspired manuscripts.

### Christ was faithful to His promise that the OT Scriptures would not perish.

> Matthew 5:18--For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

### The scribes used various techniques to insure the accuracy of the copied manuscripts of the Hebrew text. They used tests such as counting vowelpatterns and checking for the placement of certain words within the text when checking the accuracy of a newly completed copy. The entire manuscript wouldbe discarded if it was found to contain an error.

### From the end of the first century until the Protestant Reformation, theHebrew Old Testament was preserved by the Jews.

Jewish scribes carefully copied and preserved the manuscripts of the Old Testament. Augustine said, the Jewish scribes were the librarians of the Christian Church. The earliest of these scribes were called Tannaim (teachers). They copied the text of the OT with great accuracy. The Tannaim were followed by a group of scribes called Amoraim (Expositors). These were scholars who worked not only as copyists, but also produced TheTalmud which is a book of exposition on the laws and traditions of the Jews.

### The traditional (Masoretic) text was printed at the end of the medieval period. The Psalms were printed in 1477. And in 1488 the entire Hebrew Biblewas printed for the first time.

## The burial of the Hebrew manuscripts.

The Jewish Rabbis held the copies of the HolyScriptures in great esteem. When a manuscript was too old and worn to be of any further use, they were reverently retired. It was believed to be better to give them an honorable burial than to allow the risk of them to be improperly used or profaned. This is the reason that there are only so many surviving copiesof Old Testament manuscripts.

## The division of the Hebrew text into chapters and verses.

### The division of the Scripture into verses is quite an early practice and were fixed by the Masoretic family of ben Asher about AD 900.

### This system divides the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament (as we reckon them in our English Bible) into 23,100 verses. The Hebrew text is also divided into paragraphs.

### The division into chapters was first done by Cardinal Hugh of St. Cherin 1244.

## <span id="bkmrk--1"></span> 3. Determinition of the Canon

```
<h1><span lang="en">Determination of Canonization</span></h1>
<p>What determined which books would be included in the Bible and which books would not be included in the Canon of Scripture? This is an important question which must be able to be answered by the serious student of the Bible. You must know beyond doubt that the Bible in its current form is THE INSPIRED WORD OF GOD.</p> 

```

## Incorrect Views on the Determination of Canonicity

### The religious leaders determined Canonicity.

Religious councils did not determine Canonicity. The councils of man can not make a book Scripture which in its own nature is not Scripture.

### Critics will assert man had to decide which books to include in the Canon therefore placing doubt on the reliability of the Bible.

### It has been argued that men chose only books that were in agreement with their religious views to be in the Canon.

This is therefore said to be the only reason for the unity and harmony of the Scriptures. The argument is that men excluded books that did not agree with their views and included only books that did agree with their views. This false view places man as the determiner of theCanon.

## CorrectViews on the Determination of Canonicity

### God determined Canonicity.

God gave to man the books that He wanted to be included in the Bible. God protected and preserved the books thatHe inspired and safeguarded their collection into the Canon.

### TheDivine Inspiration of a book determined Canonicity.

A book was included in the Canon because it was recognized to be the Divine Inspired Word of God. A book thatwas not deemed to be of Divine authority was not included as part of the Canon of Scripture.

## <span id="bkmrk--2"></span> 4. Homologoumena, Antilegomena and Apocryphal

# Homologoumena, Antilegomena and Apocryphal

## Homologoumena means acknowledged and refers to the readily accepted books of the New Testament.

Twenty out of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament were readily and universally accepted as genuine, and called the Homologoumena. These twenty books were the fourGospels, the Acts, the epistles of Paul (except Hebrews), and the first epistles of John and Peter.

## Antilegomena means disputed and refers to the books that were not readily accepted by the church leaders and took more time to be accepted into the Canon of Scripture.

The seven books were Hebrews, II and III John, II Peter, Jude, James, Revelation. These were disputed for a time and called the Antilegomena

There were various questions with regard to the books called Antilegomena. One question was that of whether they were really written by the men who were called their authors. Hebrews bore no name of its author, and differed in style from the acknowledgedPauline epistles; II Peter differed in style from I Peter; James and Jude called themselves servants; and not apostles; the writer of II and III John called himself an elder and not an apostle. Apostolic authorship was considered an important factor in recognizing the Canonicity of a book. There were many forgeries claiming apostolic authority, therefore these books were scrutinized more carefully before they were admitted into the Canon.

Another question was that Jude recorded accounts not mentioned anywhere else in Scripture and makes mention of Enoch which was thought to be associated with the Apocrypha. The book of Revelation was not understood by many of the church leaders and therefore was questionable in their minds. These books were not at once accepted into their place in the Canon. After a deliberate examination,however, they were at last received as genuine, the very delay proving the close scrutiny which was involved in the process of Canonization. At the beginning of the fourth century they were received by most of the churches, andat the end of the fourth century they were received by all.

 ```
<h2><span lang="en">Apocryphal Books</span></h2>
<p>The Apocrypha generally refers to the books placed between the Old and New Testaments and included as an addendum to some Canons.</p> 

```

These books derive their name from a Greek word, apokruphos ,which means hidden. They are called this because they are hidden and of unknownauthority.

The Roman Catholic Church accepts the Apocrypha as part of their Canon of Scripture.

 The Jews regarded them as being a valuable history of their nation.

These books did not meet the basic tests of Canonicity. They were not recognized as inspired books by the Jews. They were given a place by themselvesin the sacred volume, but with the distinct statement that they were not to be regarded as of equal authority with the books of the Canon.

Some of the Church leaders also used this term to refer to any non-canonical book.

## ThePseudepigraphical Writings

This is a term applied to books deemed non canonical but claiming some kind of religious authenticity or value.

Some of the books in this category were deemed forgeries claimingApostolic origin such as the Gospel according to Thomas.

There were many books written that were not inspired, yet claimed some kind of Divine approval. The books in this category are termedPseudepigraphical Writings. This is a term that is used in many commentaries and research materials. The serious student of the Bible should at least havea basic understanding of what is meant by this term.

## <span id="bkmrk--3"></span> 5. Discovery of the O.T. Canon

```
<h1><span lang="en">Discovery of the O.T. Canon</span></h1>
<h2>InternalCross-Referencing</h2> 

```

## There is no complete historical record of the acceptance of each O. book; therefore, the narratives of theBible itself are the best historical records we have.

### The Books of the Law were accepted immediately by Israel. -Ex. 24: 3-4

### Joshua wrote in the book of the Law of God. â€"Joshua 24:26.

### Samuel's book was placed before the Lord. â€"I Samuel 10:25.

### The Book of the Law was re-established in Josiah's time. -IIKings 22:8-11,23:1-2

### Ezra and Nehemiah admonished the people to pledge allegiance to the books of the Law of Moses. â€"Nehemiah chapter 8 and 10:28-29

### Later writers recognized earlier writings as being God's authoritativeWord.

#### Daniel recognized the book of Jeremiah to be from the Lord. â€" Dan. 9:2

#### The books of the Law of Moses are mentioned in other books of the OT. -Josh. 1:8,8:31, I Kings 2:3, II Kings 14:6, 21:8, 23:25, Dan. 9:11-13, Mal 4:4

#### Solomon's writings are referred to in I Kings 4:32

#### Jeremiah mentioned Micah's prophecy from a century before. -26:17-29

##  Tests of Old Testament Canonicity

There were tests used by the Jewish leaders to judge the canonicity of a book. These principals have been determined from the writers of Biblical and Church history. There was a systematic approach to the recognition of the Canonicity of a book. This section makes mention of theBiblical writers of the canonical books. These references are only in respect to the fact that they were the human tools of the Divine Author.

### Was it written by Moses?

Mosaic authorship of a book was considered a valid test of Inspiration by the Jews from time immemorial. Moses is reverenced as the great prophet of the Jews. The books that were written byMoses were considered to be of Divine origin from the earliest of the Jewish historical record. The evidence of archaeology in Palestine strongly supports this traditional view. Jesus confirmed that Moses was the human vessel who received the Law. Did not Moses give you the Law â€" John 7:19. As was already stated the Biblical account records the immediate acceptance of the books of the law as being given by God.

### Was it written by a known prophet of God?

If the book was written by a known prophet ofGod who was considered to be an oracle of God; then the book was believed to be the Word of God.

### Was its writer confirmed by acts of God?

The writer was considered to be a man of God ifhe had the witness of the power of God in his life. If the writer was considered to be a man of God then his writings were also considered to be fromGod. The sons of the prophets recognized the authority of Elisha when they saw him take up the mantle of Elijah and part the Jordan River. â€" II Kings 2:15.

### Is it in agreement with the rest of Canonical Scripture?

There must be perfect unity of Scripture. Doctrine in one part of Scripture must agree with the truths contained in other parts of Scripture. As has already been stated some will argue that books were only chosen that agreed with the views of the leaders who chose them. Yet, a book could not be considered as Canonical if it was not in agreement with the rest of the received Scripture. A book was recognized as being Canonical because it was inspired. This as we can see was not the only test of theCanonicity of a book. And obviously a book of Divine origin would not contradict another book of Divine origin.

###  Does it tell the truth about God?

The book must be accurate in its description of God and the things of God. The book would be rejected as being divinely inspired if it contained error concerning theology.

### Was it accepted by the Jewish leaders as being authoritativeScripture?

Some books were accepted by the Jewish leaders as being Canonical while others were not. This is a testimony that the Jewish leaders recognized the books that were included in their Canon to be authoritativeScripture.

## <span id="bkmrk--4"></span> 6. N.T. Testimony on the O.T. Canon

## Jesus confirmed the authority of the Old Testament Canon.

### Jesus referred to the three divisions of the OT Canon: the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.

> Luke 24:44—…all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses ,and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me.

### It was common knowledge at the time of Christ that the OT was divided into these three sections. By mentioning these sections, Jesus was confirming the authority of the OT Canon as divided. The Jews of Jesus day would have understood that He was referring to the complete Canon (of the Old Testament) in this statement:

#### Jesus questioned the Jews: Did not Moses give you the Law? --John7:19

#### Jesus mentions the Law and the prophets. -Mt. 5:17; 22:40.

####  Psalms generally refer to the section more commonly called The Writings.

### Jesus read from the book of Isaiah. Lk. 4:17-21. Jesus referred to this passage as Scripture and thus confirmed the authority and inspiration of the text.

### Jesus would not have quoted the OT books if they were not inspired.

## The New Testament confirms the authority of the Old Testament.

### There are about 263 direct quotations from the OT in the NT. The use of these quotes in the NT indicates that they were considered to be theAuthoritative Word of God.

### Paul referred to the OT writings as Scripture. Rom. 10:11; 11:2;Gal. 3:8

## <span id="bkmrk--5"></span> 7. Description of the the N.T. Canon

```
<h1><span lang="en">Description of the N.T. Canon</span></h1>
<h2>The New Testament Canon is divided into five categories.</h2> 

```

### Gospels: Matthew,Mark, Luke, John

### History: Acts

### Pauline Epistles: Romans,1&amp;2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1&amp;2Thessalonians, 1&amp;2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews\*

### General Epistles:(Hebrews\*) James, I&amp;2 Peter, 1,2&amp;3 John, Jude

### Prophecy: Revelation

## The Textus Receptus

### The Latin phrase TextusReceptus means Received Text and refers to the Greek New Testament manuscripts as they were commonly accepted by the early church. There is aclear traceable stream of the inspired text that was commonly accepted by the early church. God has preserved His Word through the ages.

### 99 % of over 5,200 manuscripts of the Greek New Testament agree with the KJV andErasmus' Greek New Testament. Less then 1% (. 08%) agree with the odd omissions and changes in the TNIV, NIV, ESV, HCSB, NASB, NRSV, NLB, CEV, NCV, NAB, andNJB. (G. Riplinger, â€œIn Awe of the Wordâ€&#157;, 2003)

### The Textus Receptus are theMSS which were used by the Reformers. TheChristian church recognizes the twenty-seven books of the Textus Receptus as being the New Testament Canon and all other MSS that remain are so contradictory and mixed up they cannot be considered trustworthy.

## The first printed Greek New Testament

### Erasmus published a Greek New Testament text in 1516. Erasmus used every available manuscript to print his Greek New Testament. He even referred to theLatin Vulgate which he believed to be greatly flawed and corrupt to insure that he looked to every possible source. He looked to gain the pure original meaning of the Holy Spirit inspired text. Erasmus' Greek New Testament was a faithful consensus of the handwritten Greek texts which were used before the printing press. He used every manuscript available and compared them with great care to insure a correct Greek New Testament would be printed and circulated for the first time.

### Erasmus did not create the Textus Receptus ; he collected and printed. He collected the many handwritten copies of Scripture in circulation and comparing one with the other discerned a true consensus among the MSS from which he printed his N.

> We should not attribute to Erasmus the creation of a â€˜received text,' but only the transmission from a manuscript text, already commonly received, to a  **printed** form, in which this text would continue to prevail for three centuries. â€&#157; -- Kenneth W. Clark, Greek manuscript scholar (emphasis added)

## The Holy Ghost guarded and preserved the true New Testament Text.

### God's Word will not pass away.

> Mathew24:35--Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

> I Peter1:23--Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by theword of God which liveth and abideth for ever.

### The Holy Ghost taught the Christians which books were inspired.

> John 14:25-26--These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter,which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

### The Holy Spirit also led the Christians as to which books were not inspired. Some books were mistakenly regarded as canonical by some of the early Christians. For example, Ireneus considered â€œThe Shepherd of Hermesâ€&#157; to be inspired. The Holy Spirit would eventually fix the canon in its current form of the 27 books of the New Testament.

## The Received Text of the NT was preserved by the leaders of the Church.

### In the very beginning of the church the Apostles instructed the church as to which books were inspired and which books were not. Remember John, the last of the original Apostles, was instrumental in instructing the Church and passing on the true inspired manuscripts of the New Testament until approximately AD 100.

### The early church leaders passed on the manuscripts of theNew Testament. Ignatius and Polycarp, leaders of the early church, were taught by the Apostle John giving them direct Apostolic instruction as to the knowledge of the inspired manuscripts. Polycarp taught Irenaeus who would continue as a leader in the church. The leaders instructed their successors in the truth of God's Word.

## <span id="bkmrk--6"></span> 8. Discovery of the N.T. Canon

```
<h1><span lang="en">Discovery of the N.T. Canon</span></h1>
<h2>There is some historical account as to the acceptance of the New Testament Canon.</h2> 

```

### The first New Testament books to be assembled together were the Epistles of Paul. A collection of Paul's Epistles was in circulation at the beginning of the second century. Ignatius a leader in the second century referred toPaul's epistles as Scripture. A collection of the Pauline epistles existed atthe time Polycarp wrote to the Philippians and when Ignatius wrote his seven letters to the churches of Asia Minor about AD 115.

### The four Gospels were collected together in a compiled format sometime in the earlier part of the second century. The exact date when the Four Gospels were collected together is unknown. It is generally agreed that they must have been collected together and accepted before AD 170,because the four canonical Gospels are used by Tatian, a church leader, in his harmony of the Gospels written in AD 170. IrenÃ¦us , in his work "Against Heresies" (A. 182-88),names the four Gospels of the New Testament and refers to them as Scripture.

### The four Gospels referred to as The Gospel and the Pauline Epistles referred to as the Apostle were in circulation as separate collections in the early years of the second century. These two parts were to be connected by the Book of Acts which brought the two collections together into one collection of books. This was the beginning stages of the collecting of the New Testament books into one complete Canon.

### Before AD 200 the Epistles of Paul, theGospels, Acts, I Peter and I John were recognized as Scripture by the Christian church. The writings of Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian indicate the acceptance of these books as inspired and Canonical and accorded an authority equal to that of the Old Testament Scriptures.

### The seven remaining books, 2 and 3 John, 2Peter, Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation, were accepted as Scripture aroundAD 300.

## A testimony within the New Testament itself.

### The Apostle Peter, shortly before he died, referred to Paul's Epistles as Scripture, and also makes mention of the rest of Scripture indicating thathe esteemed the other completed inspired books as Scripture. â€" II Peter3:15-16.

### Revelation refers to itself as a book of prophecy. â€" Rev. 1:3, 22:18,19.

## There is historical evidence of the use of the N. books by the early church leaders.

Clement of Rome (97-140) wrote much from and about the New Testament. Clement of Rome in AD 95 wrote a letter inthe name of the Christians of Rome to those in Corinth. In this letter he uses material found in Matthew and Luke.

Ignatius (AD35-116) refers to large portions of the New Testament. The Epistles of Ignatius (AD115) uses language from nearly all of the Pauline epistles. The Epistle to Polycarp mentions portions of Philipians and cites nine of the other Pauline epistles. Ignatius quotes from Matthew and also from I Peter and I John.

Polycarp (AD 69- 155) refers much to the writings of the New Testament.

## Thereis historical testimony of the acceptance of the Canon by church leaders.

Theophilus (AD 115-188}, Bishop of Antioch AD 168, refers to the evangelists and the Holy Scriptures of the New Testament.

Clement of Alexandria (AD115-188) in the latter part of the second century refers to the collection of the fourGospels as being recognized as Scripture.

### Irenaeus (AD 130-200) refers to the New Testament writings as the Holy Scriptures. He quotes from every N. book except Philemon and IIIJohn. The New Testament Canon recognized by Irenaeus was very close to what we hold today.

### Tertullian (AD 160-221) uses for the first time the termNew Testament, and calls the whole Bible the whole instrument of both Testaments.

### Eusebius (AD 260-340) in approximately AD 330 divides all the 27 books of the New Testament into the disputed and non disputed categories.

### Athanius (AD298-373), Bishop of Alexandria, in his Easter letter of AD 367 lists the 27 books of the New Testament and he used the phrase being canonized in regards to them.

## Tests of New Testament Canonicity

There were tests that were used by the early church to judge the Canonicity of a book. There were many church leaders involved at different times who judged which books were inspired and which books were not. The following four guidelines was used by these leaders in their discovery of the New TestamentCanon.

###  Was the book written by an Apostle?

We understand that God is the author of the New Testament. The Apostles were some of the Holy men of God that The Divine Author spoke through. If a book could be proven to have been written by one of the original Apostles of Jesus it was considered to be of Divine origin. Much weight was put on the teaching and instruction of the original Apostles. The writings attributed to the apostles circulated amongst the earliest Christian communities.

###  Was the book approved by an apostle?

 It was believed that the original Apostles would know which books were inspired and which books were not. A book not written by an Apostle that had Apostolic approval was considered to be of Divine origin.

###  Was the book universally accepted by the early church by the end of the fourth century?

There were certain books that were accepted almost immediately by the early church as being Divine Scripture. These books were readily included in the Canon. There were other books that took time to be accepted by the church as being Canon.

###  Was the book read publicly when the early church gathered for theLord's Supper?

We have historical records from the early church leaders that indicate which books were read at church gatherings. These books were used by the church because they were considered to be inspired.

###  Was the book consistent with the rest of accepted Scripture?

As has been stated in regards to the acceptance of Old Testament Scripture that a book must be in perfect harmony with the rest of the accepted Canon. Even so the New Testament books that were received must also be in harmony with both the Old Testament Canon and the New Testament Canon of Scripture.

## <span id="bkmrk--7"></span> 9. Various Other Canons

```
<h1><span lang="en">List of Various Canons</span></h1>
<h2>Different Canons have been listed by different religious groups and church leaders throughout history.</h2> 

```

## The Jewish Canon

The Jewish Canon is composed of the 39 books of the Old Testament.

## The Samaritan Canon

# The Samaritan Canon is the smallest Bible in the world recognizing only the fivebooks of the Pentateuch.

## The Marcion Canon

Marcion was the first to compile alist with some of the New Testament books. Marcion rejected the Old Testament entirely and regarded the God of the Old Testament as inferior to Jesus. Marcion's Canon comprised ten of the Pauline epistles (without the Pastorals)and Luke's Gospel. He edited these books to agree with his warped teaching.

Even though he was false the rise of false teaching made the church more aware of the need to define a true Canon of Scripture.

## The Muratorian fragment Canon

The Muratorian fragment lists aCanon of New Testament books. The Muratorian fragment which is an ancient archeological manuscript dating back around AD 200 lists a Canon of NewTestament books. It is not fully readable and therefore is referred to as a fragment. It recognizes all the books except Hebrews, James, II Peter, andIII John. There is also a question as to whether I Peter is mentioned. It includes one book, the Apocalypse of Peter which was later rejected as being canonical.

## The Tertullian Canon

Tertullian (AD160-221) had 22 books in his NT Canon which included the four Gospels, Acts, the thirteen epistles ofPaul, I Peter, I John, Jude and Revelation. He did not treat Hebrews asCanonical.

## TheOrigen Canon

Origen (AD. 185-254) acknowledged the four canonical Gospels, Acts, the Pauline epistles and Hebrews, I Peter, IJohn and Revelation as undisputed books. Origen acknowledged that Hebrews, IIPeter, II and III John, James and Jude as disputed books.

## The Eusebius Canon

Eusebius (AD 260-340) isconsidered a church historian. He provides us with a full statement in whichhe explains the position of the Church at large. He makes an importantdistinction between homologoumena (recognized books) and antilegomena (disputed books). The recognized books are the Gospels, Acts, the epistles ofPaul including Hebrews, I Peter, I John, and Revelation. He divides the disputed books into two sub-classes: (1) those that ought to be included in the canon â€" James, Jude, II Peter, II and III John (2) those that ought not to be included -- the Acts of Paul, the Shepherd of Hermes, the Apocalypse of Peter,the Didache, Barnabas. He also questioned the inclusion of Revelation based on some uncertainty as to apostolic authorship. Apart from his hesitation onRevelation Eusebius' New Testament is identical to ours.

## TheAthanius Canon

Athanasius (AD 298-373) Athanasius lists the 27 books of our New Testament.

## The Roman Catholic Canon

The Roman Catholic Church includes the 66 books of our Bible and also accepts the Apocrypha as part of their Canon of Scripture. This is the same Canon as Jerome's who produced the Latin Vulgate which is the basis for the Roman Catholic Bible.

## The Recognized True Canon of the Christian Church

The true Canon consists of the 39Old Testament books and the 27 New Testament books of the Bible.

## The Luther Canon

Martin Luther listed the 27 books of our New Testament except he regarded four books as being questionable. He placed Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation at the end of his New Testament in a detached position.# Chapter 5: God's Word Into English

## <span id="bkmrk-"></span> 1. Timeline of the English Bibles

Progression of the Bibles

English Bibles have been in agreement with each other and the RECEIVED TEXT from the Gothic to the KJV.

**The Wycliffe Bible.**

John Wycliffe translated a hand written copy of the complete Bible into English. This project took several years to complete which was finished approximately in 1380.

The Wycliffe Bible predates Erasmus Greek NT so he could not have had access to it. Yet the Wycliffe Bible is in perfect harmony with Erasmus' Greek NT indicating that the then common received Greek text available to Wycliffe was the same commonly received text which was the basis for Erasmus' Greek NT.

Wycliffe also used the original language manuscripts of Hebrew and Greek.

Wycliffe did not use the corrupt Latin Vulgate as the basis for his translation.

The Catholic Church tried many times unsuccessfully to stop the work of Wycliffe.

**The Tyndale New Testament**

Tyndale also followed the Pre-Wycliffe and Wycliffe Bibles closely. The Wording of the Tyndale NT is similar to that of the Wycliffe Bible.

In 1525-1526 the Tyndale New Testament became the first printed edition of the Scripture in the English language. There are two copies still in existence today of this Tyndale first edition NT.

Tyndale used the very simple popular language of the people. Tyndale himself realized there would one day be a need for a fuller translation with deeper vocabulary.

A law punishable by death was enacted in 1530 that forbid owning or selling an English Bible. Foxe describes person after person, burned at the stake for owning the Scriptures in English.

Tyndale's final prayer before he was burned at the stake in October of 1536 was: O Lord, open the King of England's eyes. This prayer would be answered just three years later in 1539, when King Henry VIII finally allowed, and even funded, the printing of an English Bible known as the Great Bible.

**The Coverdale Bible**

Myles Coverdale had worked with Tyndale on the OT Translation into English. Coverdale finished translating the OT and in 1535 he printed the first complete Bible in the English language.

THIS WAS THE FIRST COMPLETE BIBLE TO BE PRINTED IN ENGLISH!

The Coverdale Bible consisted of Tyndale's NT and the portions of the OT that were completed by Tyndale. It was the work of Tyndale with Coverdale finishing the uncompleted portions of the OT.

Coverdale who worked with Tyndale also used the Pre-Wycliffe and Wycliffe Bibles. The Coverdale Bible is in agreement with earlier English Bibles and the KJV.

**The Great Bible**

This was the first English Bible authorized for public use. Coverdale was hired by Cranmmer the Archbishop of Canterbury at the request of Henry VIII to publish a Bible.

It was called the Great Bible due to its size. It was a pulpit version measuring over 14 inches tall. It was published in 1539.

It was not just a reprint of the Coverdale Bible. Coverdale polished and refined the Tyndale Bible. The Great Bible was another step to the KJV.

**The Geneva Bible**

The Geneva Bible is so named because it was produced in Geneva by exiles from England. It was published in 1560.

It was based on Tyndale's Bible and is almost identical to the KJV.

The Geneva Bible was the first Bible taken to America. It was the Bible of the Puritans and Pilgrims. It is truly the Bible of the Protestant Reformation.

The flaw of the Geneva Bible was the marginal notes were written by John Calvin and his assistants. The notes are strong Calvinistic and promote the false doctrines of eternal security and the predestination.

**The Bishops' Bible**

Archbishop Parker along with other bishops produced in 1568 what is referred to as the Bishops' Bible. It is so called because it was produced by the Bishops of the Church of England.

The Bishops' Bible was produced to conform to the structure of the Church of England, and to stand against the false notes of Calvinism contained in the Geneva Bible.

It followed the common English translation. Most of the text is Tyndale's and it is very similar to the KJV.

The Bishops' Bible improved on the word order of earlier versions. The words were the same, but syntax was improved for clarity. This Bible was one of the main sources for the KJV.

## <span id="bkmrk--0"></span> 2. The Bible In Languages that would Later Develop into English

# <span lang="en">The Bible In Languages that would Later Develop into English</span>

## The Gothic language was an early predecessor of the English language.

### Gothic is an early root of the English language.

### Ulfilas also called Wulfila the Apostle translated the Bible into Gothic in AD 350.

### We start with this primitive root of the English language to show the clear stream of English Bible translation from the Hebrew Masoretic text and the Greek TEXTUS RECEPTUS. The Gothic Bible is in perfect harmony with the KJV and the RECEIVED TEXT.

## Anglo-Saxon is another step of the English language.

### This language is referred to as Old English.

### There is much historical evidence to show the use of Anglo-Saxon Bibles as early as the 6th century. Portions of these texts still remain today.

### The Wycliffe Bible states in the preface that the Bible had been translated into Saxon by Bede a seventh century theologian thus adding more historical support for the existence of at least portions of the Bible in Anglo-Saxon

## Middle English developed from Old English during the 12th through the 14th centuries.

### This pre-Wycliffe Bible English is another step in the development of the modern English language.

### There is archaeological evidence to support the existence of at least part of the English Bible before the Wycliffe Bible of 1389.

### Wycliffe in his preface mentions that he had gathered many older English Bibles.# Chapter 6: Modern Versions of the Bible

## <span id="bkmrk-"></span> 1. Two Streams of Bible Transmission

The modern versions differ in meaning from the King James Version.

Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.

> Jeremiah 23:36--And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.

The new modern versions pervert the truth of THE WORD OF GOD!

### a. There are two historical streams of Bible Manuscripts.

The manuscripts that came out of Antioch which are the source of pure Bibles and the KJV.

The manuscripts that came out of Alexandria which are the source of corrupted Bibles and the new modern versions such as the NIV.

Ninety-five percent of the existing manuscript evidence can be traced to the pure texts from Antioch and is in agreement with the KJV.

### b. The pure stream of Antioch.

13. Antioch which was located in Syria is the first place the saints were referred to as Christians.
14. The texts from Antioch are known as the Syrian or Byzantine text.
15. These manuscripts from Antioch are those that were received by the majority of the Christian church and referred to as the Received Text.
### c. The polluted stream of Alexandria.

17. Alexandria is located in Egypt. It was a seat of false worship and pagan philosophy.
18. These Alexandrian texts were the source of Wescott and Hort's corrupt Greek New Testament and Jerome's Latin Vulgate.
19. The manuscripts from Alexandria were produced by Origen, Clement of Alexandria and other infidels who did not believe in the Divine inspiration of Scripture.
THERE ARE ONLY TWO STREAMS OF BIBLES: THE DEVIL'S STREAM FROM ALEXANDRIA, AND GOD'S STREAM FROM ANTIOCH!

## <span id="bkmrk--0"></span> 2. Biblia Hebraica

### Rudolph Kittel

- Mr. Kittel produced a New Hebrew Old Testament text in 1909.

This text is referred to as Biblia Hebraica

The devil had already produced a new Greek text and was again at work to change and twist the Hebrew text of the pure Bibles.

This text differed from the traditionally accepted Hebrew Masoretic text used by the KJV translators.

- "Rudolph Kittel was Anti-Semitic"

### This false Hebrew text was used as a source for the new modern Bibles.

The NIV used the Biblia Hebracia for the Hebrew translation of the Old Testament.

The New King James Version primarily uses the 1967/ 1977 Stuttgart edition of Biblia Hebraica, which was another publication of Kittel's Hebrew text.

The new modern versions looked to this distorted text as a source for their translations.

## <span id="bkmrk--1"></span> 3. Verity of the Claim of More Accurate Manuscripts

# <span lang="en">The Lie of New More Accurate Manuscripts</span>

## KJV critics claim there have been new more accurate manuscripts found since 1611 that were not available to the KJV translators.

### It is true that there have been new manuscripts found since 1611. It is not true that they are more accurate than the Received Text of the KJV.

### Even though there have been new manuscripts found since 1611, there have been no new renditions of the manuscripts that were then available to the KJV translators.

### The Sinaiticus was not available to the KJV translators, but the similar Vaticanus was available and rejected by the KJV translators

## The discovered manuscripts support the Received Text and the KJV.

### The recently discovered manuscripts support the accuracy of the Received Text and the KJV.

### There are no readings available today which were not already in the hands of the King James translators.

### The newly discovered manuscripts add to the volume of the majority texts of Antioch.

## The truth about the Dead Sea Scrolls.

### The Dead Sea scrolls were found in the Qumran caves near Jericho in 1947. KJV critics claim these were older manuscripts not available in 1611 to the KJV translators.

### The fact is these manuscripts are in total agreement with the Received Text and the KJV.

### The Isaiah Scroll dated at 100 BC is the now oldest available manuscript and is in perfect harmony with the book of Isaiah in the KJV. So the truth of the matter is the oldest manuscripts support the KJV.

## <span id="bkmrk--2"></span> 4. Jerome's Latin Vulgate

# <span lang="en">Jerome's Corrupt Latin Vulgate</span>

## Jerome was commissioned by Pope Damasus I to produce a Latin Bible for the Roman Catholic Church in AD 382, this Bible is referred to as Jerome's Latin Vulgate.

### Jerome admitted to altering the text in his preface to the Latin Vulgate.

### Jerome's Vulgate is the source of the corrupt Catholic Douay version of the Bible produced in 1609.

### Jerome may have consulted the Alexandrian manuscripts of Eusebius since they were in existence prior to the Latin Vulgate. )

### Wycliffe did not use the corrupt Latin Vulgate.

### Erasmus rejected Jerome's Latin Vulgate.

### Tyndale used Erasmus Greek text and the Wycliffe Bible, not the Latin Vulgate which does not agree with Tyndale's work.

### The KJV translators had access to Jerome's Latin Vulgate, BUT THEY REJECTED IT AS FALSE!

## Jerome used the Alexandrian Manuscripts for the Latin Vulgate.

### The Vulgate agrees with the existing manuscripts Vaticanus and Sinaiticus which are two of the Bibles of Constantine.

### Jerome's Vulgate became the basis for many of the new modern Bible versions. .

### Jerome altered his text to conform to the paganism of the Roman Church.

## Anthony Hort and Brooke Wescott created a New Greek NT text in 1875.

### This corrupt Greek text is one of the sources of our modern Bibles.

### These men were involved in the Catholic Church and the occult, they did not believe in the infallibility of the Scriptures, and held many philosophies that are contrary to the Bible.

### They followed the pagan minority manuscripts of Alexandria that agreed with their pagan philosophy.

## Wescott and Hort used the Vaticanus and Sinaiticus manuscripts for their New Greek text.

### They rejected the Textus Receptusand chose to use the corrupt minority manuscripts of Alexandria.

### The new versions supported by this Greek text stem from the paganism and idolatry of Egypt.

### The devil used these men to attempt to undermine the KJV and promote the new false perversions of the Bible.

## This perverted Greek NT was the foundation for the English Revised Version, the American Standard Version, and other new modern Bible versions.

### Wescott ansd Hort used their new perverted Greek text as the foundation for the Revised Version New Testament which was published in 1881

### The Revised Version Old Testament published in 1885 follows the corruption of Jerome and the Alexandrian manuscripts.

### This was the first major attack by the devil on the pure King James Version of the Bible.

## <span id="bkmrk--3"></span> 5. The Vaticanus and Sinaiticus

# <span lang="en">The Deception of the Vaticanus and Sinaiticus</span>

## The Vaticanus manuscript was found in the Vatican library in 1481.

### The King James translators rejected the Vaticanus because it was corrupt and did not agree with the Majority Texts of Antioch.

### Large portions of Scripture are missing from this manuscript:

### The Vaticanus came from the corrupt Alexandrian text

## The Sinaiticus was found in a garbage can in St. Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in 1844 by Constantine Tischendorf.

79. Tischendorf, who discovered the Sinaiticus manuscript, noted at least 12,000 changes that had been made on this manuscript by others than the original copyist.
80. It also omits large portions of Scripture which are contained in the majority texts of Antioch.
81. This again is a Catholic manuscript and is a relative text to the Vaticanus.
## These corrupted manuscripts can be traced to the corrupt manuscripts of Alexandria.

83. Constantine, the first historical Pope, commissioned Eusebius to make 50 Bibles in AD 331. Eusebius was a follower of Origen and used the Alexandrian texts as the source for these Bibles.
84. It is believed by many scholars that the two corrupt Catholic manuscripts the Vaticanus (codex B) and the Sinaiticus (Codex Aleph) are two of these Bibles that were created by Eusebius.
85. Vaticanus and Siniaticus disagree with the true manuscripts of Antioch.
## <span id="bkmrk--4"></span> 6. Defense of the King James Version

### a. The Preservation of God's Word into English

The King James Version which is also called the Authorized Version is the Word of God preserved and translated into English.

> The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. - Ps 12:6-7

God promised to preserve His Word for ever.

> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.-- Mt. 24:35

God has kept His promise and preserved His Word in the English language.

Not every modern English version is the pure Word of God.

God guarded the translation of His Word into English.

### The word translation means that which is produced by turning words and phrases from one language into another language.

### God is able to keep His Word pure and complete even through the process of translation.

### Men paid the price with their very lives to preserve and pass on the Scriptures.

## The KJV is the pure Word of God in the English language.

### There is a pure stream of transmission from the Hebrew MASORETIC TEXT, the Greek RECEIVED TEXT, and the early English Bibles to the KJV.

 The word Masoretic means traditional. This refers to the traditionally accepted Hebrew Text.

 The Latin word Textus Receptus means received text and refers to the commonly accepted Greek Text of the New Testament.

### The KJV does not merely contain God's Word; it is God's Word.

### b. The Commission of King James to Translate the Bible into English

## The newly crowned King James convened the Hampton Court Conference in 1604.

### The conference consisted of church leaders gathered to address problems in the church.

### The Puritan president of Corpus Christi College, John Reynolds made a motion for a new translation of the Bible.

### A plan was formed to search out the best learned men to work on this translation.

## The resolution of King James:

> That a translation be made of the whole Bible, as consonant as can be to the original Hebrew and Greek; and this to be set out and printed, without any marginal notes, and only to be used in all churches of England in time of divine service.

### A resolve was made to keep the translation to the meaning of the original Hebrew and Greek.

### There were to be no marginal notes included in this translation.

### This was to be the standard Bible for the Church of England used in all times of Divine service.

## Translators were appointed by King James to complete the work.

### King James sought out the best qualified men. These men were the best Biblical scholars and language experts of their day. Many of them spoke several languages fluently.

### Strict guidelines were set for the process of translation.

### The King James Version was published in 1611.

 THE KJV IS THE PURE WORD OF GOD, PRESERVED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!

## <span id="bkmrk--5"></span> 7. A Closer Look at the New International Version (NIV)

- The first NIV was published in 1978.

### The NIV is based on the Sinaiticus and the Vaticanus and on the Biblia Hebracia.

### The NIV lists Kittel's Theological Dictionary as a reference source.

### The NIV has been endorsed by the Catholics and is promoted as an accepted translation for Roman Catholics to use.

## The NIV adds and takes away from the Word of God.

### God gives warning to those who take away the word of God.

And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

### The NIV completely takes away 17 key verses and removes 64,576 words. That is approximately 8% of God's Word that is taken away.

## The new 2011 NIV Edition is moving toward a gender neutral version.

### This edition has been rejected by several denominations because of the gender inclusive wording.

### There have been some corrections made in some verses while changes have been made in others.

### This is a move towards a homosexual gender neutral version.# Chapter 7: Imagery and Typology of the Bible
