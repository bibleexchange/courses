<h2>The Vaticanus manuscript was found in the Vatican library in 1481.</h2>
 
<h3>The King James translators rejected the Vaticanus because it was corrupt and did not agree with the Majority Texts of Antioch.</h3>
 
<h3>Large portions of Scripture are missing from this manuscript:</h3>
 
<h3>The Vaticanus came from the corrupt Alexandrian text</h3>
 
<h2>The Sinaiticus was found in a garbage can in St. Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai in 1844 by Constantine Tischendorf.</h2>
 
<li>Tischendorf, who discovered the Sinaiticus manuscript, noted at least 12,000 changes that had been made on this manuscript by others than the original copyist.</li>
 
<li>It also omits large portions of Scripture which are contained in the majority texts of Antioch.</li>
 
<li>This again is a Catholic manuscript and is a relative text to the Vaticanus.</li>
 
<h2>These corrupted manuscripts can be traced to the corrupt manuscripts of Alexandria.</h2>
 
<li>Constantine, the first historical Pope, commissioned Eusebius to make 50 Bibles in AD 331. Eusebius was a follower of Origen and used the Alexandrian texts as the source for these Bibles.</li>
 
<li>It is believed by many scholars that the two corrupt Catholic manuscripts the Vaticanus (codex B) and the Sinaiticus (Codex Aleph) are two of these Bibles that were created by Eusebius.</li>
 
<li>Vaticanus and Siniaticus disagree with the true manuscripts of Antioch.</li>
