<h1><span lang="en">The Bible In Languages that would Later Develop into English</span></h1>

<h2>The Gothic language was an early predecessor of the English language.</h2>

<h3>Gothic is an early root of the English language.</h3>

<h3>Ulfilas also called Wulfila the Apostle translated the Bible into Gothic in AD 350.</h3>

<h3>We start with this primitive root of the English language to show the clear stream of English Bible translation from the Hebrew Masoretic text and the Greek TEXTUS RECEPTUS. The Gothic Bible is in perfect harmony with the KJV and the RECEIVED TEXT.</h3>

<h2>Anglo-Saxon is another step of the English language.</h2>

<h3>This language is referred to as Old English.</h3>
<h3>There is much historical evidence to show the use of Anglo-Saxon Bibles as early as the 6th century. Portions of these texts still remain today.</h3>

<h3>The Wycliffe Bible states in the preface that the Bible had been translated into Saxon by Bede a seventh century theologian thus adding more historical support for the existence of at least portions of the Bible in Anglo-Saxon</h3>
<h2>Middle English developed from Old English during the 12th through the 14th centuries.</h2>

<h3>This pre-Wycliffe Bible English is another step in the development of the modern English language.</h3>

<h3>There is archaeological evidence to support the existence of at least part of the English Bible before the Wycliffe Bible of 1389.</h3>

<h3>Wycliffe in his preface mentions that he had gathered many older English Bibles.</h3>
