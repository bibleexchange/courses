	<h1><span lang="en">The Preservation of God's Word into English</span></h1>
	<p>The King James Version which is also called the Authorized Version is the Word of God preserved and translated into English.</p>
<blockquote>The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. - Ps 12:6-7</blockquote>
<h2>God promised to preserve His Word for ever.</h2>
<blockquote>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.-- Mt. 24:35</blockquote>

<h3>God has kept His promise and preserved His Word in the English language.</h3>

<h3>Not every modern English version is the pure Word of God.</h3>

<h2>God guarded the translation of His Word into English.</h2>

<h3>The word translation means that which is produced by turning words and phrases from one language into another language.</h3>

<h3>God is able to keep His Word pure and complete even through the process of translation.</h3>

<h3>Men paid the price with their very lives to preserve and pass on the Scriptures.</h3>
<h2>The KJV is the pure Word of God in the English language.</h2>

<h3>There is a pure stream of transmission from the Hebrew MASORETIC TEXT, the Greek RECEIVED TEXT, and the early English Bibles to the KJV.</h3>
<p> The word Masoretic means traditional. This refers to the traditionally accepted Hebrew Text.</p>
<p> The Latin word Textus Receptus means received text and refers to the commonly accepted Greek Text of the New Testament.</p>
<h3>The KJV does not merely contain God's Word; it is God's Word.</h3>
