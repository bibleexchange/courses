<h1><span lang="en">The Lie of New More Accurate Manuscripts</span></h1>
<h2>KJV critics claim there have been new more accurate manuscripts found since 1611 that were not available to the KJV translators.</h2>
 
<h3>It is true that there have been new manuscripts found since 1611. It is not true that they are more accurate than the Received Text of the KJV.</h3>
 
<h3>Even though there have been new manuscripts found since 1611, there have been no new renditions of the manuscripts that were then available to the KJV translators.</h3>
 
<h3>The Sinaiticus was not available to the KJV translators, but the similar Vaticanus was available and rejected by the KJV translators</h3>
 
<h2>The discovered manuscripts support the Received Text and the KJV.</h2>
 
<h3>The recently discovered manuscripts support the accuracy of the Received Text and the KJV.</h3>
 
<h3>There are no readings available today which were not already in the hands of the King James translators.</h3>
 
<h3>The newly discovered manuscripts add to the volume of the majority texts of Antioch.</h3>
 
<h2>The truth about the Dead Sea Scrolls.</h2>
 
<h3>The Dead Sea scrolls were found in the Qumran caves near Jericho in 1947. KJV critics claim these were older manuscripts not available in 1611 to the KJV translators.</h3>
 
<h3>The fact is these manuscripts are in total agreement with the Received Text and the KJV.</h3>
 
<h3>The Isaiah Scroll dated at 100 BC is the now oldest available manuscript and is in perfect harmony with the book of Isaiah in the KJV. So the truth of the matter is the oldest manuscripts support the KJV.</h3>
