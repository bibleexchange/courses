# Doing Good Because It is Good

TEXT: Mark 10:17-27


Doing not because it feels good, but because it is Good. Striving for a consistent Godly life.

Our lives often are like a roller coaster. We get attached to the feel good parts of our faith. "My sins are gone." "I'm forgiven." But, forget how to behave when we don't 'feel so good.'

## 1. Being Good Enough

 A Matter of Acceptance.

Mt 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
-----
 CS LEWIS: MERE CHRISTIANITY: "Unless you are perfect, I will not help you"; and as we cannot be perfect, then, if He meant that, our position is hopeless. But I do not think He did mean that. I think He meant "The only help I will give is help to become perfect.
------
### The Meaning of Goodness

- What does it mean for a person to be good?
- Is there goodness in all of us?

> Genesis 1:31&mdash;And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

Isaiah 5:20&mdash; Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

Ps 119:68 Â¶ Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

NO GOODNESS APART FROM GOD. Goodness is God's fingerprint.

You are accepted through Christ, not because of works you have done.

## 2. Doing Good

A Matter of Obedience. (Discipline of a godly life.)

### The Desire: Goodness

Ps 34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

Romans 12:21 overcome evil with good

### The Problem: What Gets in the Way

Waiting until I feel like it.

### Remedy

Empowered to do good because it is good not necessarily because it feels good.

> Ephesians 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
