<p>text: Haggai 1:1-4,14

</p>
<p>[
Hag 1:1 ¶ In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,
 2 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD'S house should be built.
 3 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,
 4 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste?
...
Hag 1:14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The work and service of God should not be a drudgery.  There is a close relationship between worship and work.

</p>
<p>Since the time of Zephaniah, startling events have taken place.  Judah was taken captive by Babylon for 70 years, a small group of Jews (Ezra. 1:5; 80,891)  has returned to Jerusalem and began building the temple. The work was opposed and stopped. For 15 years the work had ceased.

</p>
<p>When Darius confirmed Cyrus’ decree to rebuild the temple, the people built their own houses instead. They lost sight of the value of building God's house. The people really needed the encouragement.


</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The Scripture commands us to become weary in well doing, but it still happens! 

</p>
<h4>Jonah (Jonah 4:8 better for me to die than to live)</h4>
<h4>Elijah (1 Kings 19:4 under a juniper tree requested to die; vs. 9 "What doest thou here Elijah?")</h4>
<h4>Duane Miller</h4>
<p>George U. Wood writes: "Have you ever heard a healing take place? I have. I listened to an audiotape of <strong>Duane Miller</strong> teaching his Sunday school class from the text of Psalm 103 at the First Baptist Church in Brenham, Texas, on January 17, 1993. Duane <strong>prematurely retired from pastoring three years earlier</strong> because of a virus which penetrated the sheath around the nerves in his vocal cords, reducing his speech to a raspy whisper....
"Teaching his class that day with a special microphone resting on his lips, he reaffirmed his belief in divine healing and that miracles had not ended with the Book of Acts. Listening to the tape, at times you can barely 
understand his weakly spoken wheezy words of faith. The miracle happened at verse 4 when he said, 

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ps 103:1—Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: 3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he read verse 4, you can hear his voice as clear as a bell.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Thessalonians 3:13—But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Cure</h3>
<p>The cure for discouragement is the Word of the Lord.  Sin is progressive and very contagious, but God can give you power over sin and give you and abounding desire to work for Him.

</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:58—Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

</p>
<p>Philippians 2:12-13—Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.  13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

</p>
<p>Haggai is faithful to bring correction and instruction in this book, but God starts him off with stirring words of encouragement.


</p>
<h2>1. Someone Has a Word from God! (Haggai 1:12)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Hag 1:12 ¶ Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.


</p>
<p>ILLUSTRATION: A church that has passion is a church where "Discouraged folks cheer up, dishonest folks fess up, sour folks sweeten up, closed folk, open up, gossipers shut up, conflicted folks make up, sleeping folks wake up, lukewarm folk, fire up, dry bones shake up, and pew potatoes stand up! But most of all, Christ the Savior of the entire world is lifted up."

</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2. God is With Us (Haggai 1:13; 2:4)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>ILLUSTRATION: In a speech made in 1863, Abraham Lincoln said, "We have been the receipients of the choicest bounties of heaven; we have been preserved these many years in peace and prospertiy; we have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us, and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us."

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As long as you belong to Jesus, you will never be alone! Let us not be found guilty of acting like we are on our own! There is help available.

</p>
<h2>3. God is Stirring Us Up (Haggai 1:14)</h2>
<p>LOVE THE WORK. Why we started in the first place. Bring hope to the hopeless and light to those in the dark. (Average of 3 bibles in every American Household, but we are not LOVING and therefore READING the Book. 1/3 polled by Gallup knew who delivered the sermon on the mount, half could name the first book of the Bible, 80% of Christians believe the phrase "God Helps those who help themselves" is a bible verse.)

</p>
<h2>4. "Be Strong and Work" (2:4 3x's )</h2>
<p>Who saw the temple in its first glory? It is now as nothing when compared. There is a lot of ground to cover still, but we are able!

</p>
<p>chazaq - be strong - to fasten upon; to seize, be strong (figuratively, courageous, strengthen, cure, help, repair, fortify), 


</p>
<h2>5. You will Survive the Shaking (2:5-7)</h2>
<p>While nations are shaken, God's house will be filled with glory! Fear not, Two things are our protection:
</p>
<h3>The Word I Covenanted with You</h3>
<h3>My Sprit Remains Among You</h3>
<h2>6. The Best Is Yet to Come (2:8-9)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former…

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's glory that shines brighter and brighter. We haven't seen yet, the fullness of what God has for us. There are treasures to pursue and bountiful reasons to work in the kingdom of God.</p>
