# The Touch of God

> Revelation 1:17&mdash;And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:

## INTRODUCTION

The touch of God is evidenced by the fruit of the work. The fruit of the work is the evidence that God is with us and working through us.

Having His touch upon our life, is assurance that we are exactly where we need to be and are in harmony with his will.

It is a blessing to have the touch of God on our life.

## A MESSAGE FROM GOD

When the minstrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him.

> **2Ki 3:14-18** &mdash; And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. 15 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that **the hand of the LORD came upon him**. 16 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. 17 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts. 18 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand. 19 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.

PRAYING DOWN THE WIND &hellip;

> [HUDSON TAYLOR] I was nearly wrecked when I was going out to China the first time. Our vessel was becalmed, and gradually drifting upon the coast of New Guinea. We could see the savages on the shore. They had kindled a fire, and were evidently expecting a good supper that night. &hellip;. We had been becalmed for several weeks, with never a breeze, or any sign of one. In a few minutes we would be among the coral reefs. We would be at the mercy of those savages, and they didn't look as if they had much mercy. &hellip; "Well," I said, " there is one thing we haven't done yet. Let the Christians on board pray about it." &hellip; I went to my cabin, and told the Lord that I was just on my way to China; that He had sent me; and that I couldn't get there if I was shipwrecked and killed; and then I was going on to ask Him for a breeze, but I felt so confident about it that I couldn't ask Him. &hellip; Writing of this and similar experiences later, Hudson Taylor said: &quot;Thus God encouraged me, ere landing on China&apos;s shores, to bring every variety of need to Him in prayer, and to expect that He would honor the name of the Lord Jesus and give the help which each emergency required.&quot;

> **James 5:16** Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
