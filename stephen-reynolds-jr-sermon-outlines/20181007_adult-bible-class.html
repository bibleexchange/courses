<p>Numbers 16:36-40 is given after the rebellion of Korah, Dathan and
Abiram. Israel had been condemned to spend 40 years in the
wilderness. During this time the unrest mounted, and the
disappointment of the people at not being able to enter the Promised
Land, became a ground for rebellion to develop.</p>

brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given
for you: this do in remembrance of me. 20 Likewise also the cup after
supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is

creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 13 I do set my
bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between
me and the earth. 14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud
over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 15 And I
will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every
living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a
flood to destroy all flesh. 16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and
I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant
between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the
earth. 17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,
which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the
earth.</blockquote>

<h3 class="western"><a name="d-feast-of-the-tabernacles"></a>D. Feast
of the Tabernacles</h3>
<blockquote>Leviticus 23:39-43 — 
</blockquote>
<p>The Feast of the Tabernacles fell in the Autumn when the full
harvest of corn, wine and oil had been gathered in. It was the last
great feast of the year. It was a time of rejoicing and thanksgiving
when Israel showed their gratitude to God and remembered that He had
delivered them from Egyptian bondage and brought them into a land
which produced so many good things. It came five days after the Day
of Atonement when the sin of the people had been removed.</p>
<p>During the seven days of the feast Israel dwelt in booths or tents
made from the boughs of trees. It would remind them of the 40 years
in the wilderness when they dwelt in tents.</p>
<p>The feast pointed forward to the FULL harvest and the COMPLETE
result of Christ’s work.</p>
