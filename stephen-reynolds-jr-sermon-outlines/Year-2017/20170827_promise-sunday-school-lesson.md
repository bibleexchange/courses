# Dispensation of Promise

## Overview

- The Dispensation of Promise spanned 430 years from the call of Abraham to the Exodus.

- This dispensation is also called the Patriarchal Dispensation.

- This Dispensation gets its name from the promise made to Abraham and his seed. 

- This Dispensation follows after the time of the beginning of paganism. 

In our last study, Nimrod had introduced idolatry at Babel. This resulted in God confusing the languages of the people. This was the beginning of Pagan religion. Nimrod, it is believed, worshipped his mother as queen of heaven.

The Apostle Paul, speaks of the pagan world in Romans, Chapter one. They “changed the incorruptible God knot an image made like man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.” Vs. 23

Deities of human form were worshipped in Greece, those of bestial form in Egypt; and both methods of worship were practiced in Rome. Serpent worship was common in Chaldea and also in Egypt. 

The people of Abram’s day, had became so evil minded God singled out one man through which He could bring forth the promised seed.
