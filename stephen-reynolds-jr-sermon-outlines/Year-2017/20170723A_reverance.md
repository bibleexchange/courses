# Entering and Exiting His Presence

> Ezekiel 46:1-8 &mdash; ¶ Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened. 2 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening. 3 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons. 4 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. 5 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 6 And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish. 7 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah. **8 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof. 9 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.**

## Entering His Presence (Time of focused Worship)

### What does it mean to Enter his presence ?

- There is an Unbroken Stream from Christ to the Believer (the Blood, the Holy Ghost, the Word)

> 1Th 5:17 Pray without ceasing.
<!-- -->
> Isa 26:3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. 

- A Time of Focused Worship

In  the most practical sense, we cannot pray 24/7 or fast 24/7 or sing a song every single second of our life. While on this earth, necessity will move us in and out of times of focused worship.

### Should be a Joyful and Thankful Occasion

>  Psalms 100:4 &mdash; Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

Bringing Our Attention to Our Savior and what He is doing!

### Should be a Regular/Frequent Experience (Time of focused Worship)

Not just daily, but even throughout the day. 

<!-- -->

> Psalm 119:147 ¶ I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word. [cried before the dawn]

<!-- -->

> Mr 1:34,35 &mdash; And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. 35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.

<!-- -->

> Ps 18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. 

<!-- -->

> Ps 119:164 ¶ Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.

<!-- -->

> Pr 24:16 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.

### Should be a Sacred Occasion

- Shut the world out!
- Shut the Flesh out!

**There are obstacles all around us to prevent us from finding God's presence in the midst of our day!**

## Exiting His Presence (Time of focused Worship)


What Does It Mean? Why would we ever leave?

## We Cannot Truly ESCAPE His presence

> Psalms 139:8&mdash;If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.


## What Does It mean?

- JOHN WESLEY, "**perhaps to simply prevent jostling and confusion**".

A Measure of Formality is needed to REMIND us of the importance of what we are doing. 

- **Leave Differently** Than When You Came In


- **Do Not Turn Your Back** on the Lord (Improper), **Irreverent**

I'm not rebelling, I will not forget. I will go forth in the truth and victory received.
