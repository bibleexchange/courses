# A Vision for Holiness

(Read Isaiah 61:1-11)

> Isaiah 61:10 &mdash; I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.

===========================
## Catching the Vision

### Seeing More

- The Majority of the Religious World is Blind, Drunk on the World (like Ephraim)

> Isaiah 28:7 &mdash; But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; **they err in vision**, they stumble in judgment.

- Things LENT this week 
	- Beginning to Look alot like each other :) (hair styles, clothes, etc.)
	- Daily & Multiple times during the day for WORSHIP and the WORD
	- Ministry of Preachers &amp; Teachers
	- Mindfulness of God's Presence
	- Dress Code & Modesty

- Seeing More
	- Not enough hours this week to TEACH you every detail of the Glory of God and His Call to His people unto Holiness
	- But things LENT for the purpose that you would take a hold of the vision
	- The Cause must be Holiness unto the Lord (separate, other, different, THE TOUCH OF GOD UPON IT, UNCOMMON)

## A Vision for the Holiness of God (There is a Groom)

Jesus reads this chapter in Luke 4, THIS IS ME!

- GOD IS HOLY 

Without a vision for the Holiness of God, we have no MOTIVATION for worship. Apart from God, the word 'HOLY' has no meaning. [There is no LOVE, LOVE, LOVE but there is HOLY HOLY HOLY]

> Isaiah 6:3 &mdash; And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. [seraphim -- fiery creatures, HOLINESS & FIRE]

<!-- -->

> Isaiah 61:8 For I the Lord love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.

- God is to be Desired (There is a Groom) &amp; He has DECKED Himself with ORNAMENTS

- Why do we worship so? Worship is our response to God's Holiness (God's glory is the impact of His holiness on a person. CLOUD, FIRE, SHAKING, AWESOMENESS)

If there is no vision of the HOLINESS of God, there can be no true worship.

> Psalm 29:2 &mdash; Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

===========================
## A Vision for the Holiness of God's People (There is a Bride)

### The Groom WILL Have His Bride (ENGAGEMENT)

#### The Bible Relates People and God in many different Ways

- Creator and Creature
- Savior (Deliverer) and Sinner/Saints/Captive
- Friend
- Father and Children
- Great High Priest and Priests

#### There is no more important Relationship mentioned than God as THE BRIDEGROOM and His people as THE BRIDE

He has saved us for a PURPOSE. Restoring an unbroken fellowship. (62:1) FOR ZION's SAKE: His Desire is for HER!

He is Righteous & He makes her righteous!

- The Wedding is the DEFINITIVE (often cliche) Happy Ending

### The Bride Eliminates All Other Competition for Her Heart

- The Bride Sees the Groom as FAR Superior to any other Competitor for her Affection
- She sees him as unlike another and so the field is cleared
- She Eliminates the possibility that there is some competition: HE IS MINE, I AM HIS. 
- All other suitors might as well look somewhere else, because **I'm taken!**

### The Bride sees her Beloved with Eyes of Love

- My Beloved (Christians speak callously sometimes of God, lost the PRECIOUSNESS, TENDERNESS)
- He can do no wrong!
- Gaurd Your Heart, Preserve your sensitivity to God's presence
- LOVE is COMMITMENT (not some wishy washy emotion)

### The Bride Adorns Herself with Jewels

#### ADORN: The Work (We work out what God works in!) The WORK is an expression of the HEART.

- Hard Work in Preparing getting Ready

#### What is her motivation? What does HE like? What is He looking for in a Bride?

- Nothing she can do to make herself his Bride but in accepting his LOVE she is compelled to express her own love.
- The Jewels are provided By Him!!! (Work Out What God works in)

## Conclusion

> Isaiah 62:3-5 &mdash; 3 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem* in the hand of thy God. 4 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. 5 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.

A Vision for Holiness Sees There is no greater Pleasure than for God to rejoice over me.
