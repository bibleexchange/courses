# Jesus is God

John 1:1-14

- 68% believe Jesus is God
- Americans Love God and the Bible, Fuzzy on the Details
- they’re not sure everything in it is true.
- Six in 10 say everyone eventually goes to heaven, but half say only those who believe in Jesus will be saved. 
- And while 7 in 10 say there’s only one true God—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—two-thirds say God accepts worship of all faiths.
- Scott McConnell, executive director of LifeWay Research, says most Americans still identify as Christians. But they seem to be confused about some of the details of their faith.
- For example, he says, about two-thirds of Americans believe Jesus is God while half say Jesus is a being created by God. Those two beliefs don’t seem to match, he says. “Contradictory and incompatible beliefs are OK for most people,” McConnell says.

## Vs. 1 Father and Son – A distinction is made here – not part but of the whole deity The Divine Nature-The Divine Image

“In the beginning was the Word” Before the world was made when as yet there was nothing created. 
Meaning of “in the beginning.” The Word had existence before the world was created.  This was spoken of the Son, not the man Jesus.  But the Divine Son of God in the fullness of His glory.  John 17:5   17:1, 24

			Ps. 90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth.
			John 17:24  “Before the foundation of the world.”
			I Peter 1:20   Foreordained before the foundation of the world.
			Rev. 13:8      Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
			John 8:58; 17:5  6:62  3:13  6:46  8:14  16:28

			a)	Eternity - unmeasurable, indefinite eternity
The fact of			that preceded all time
existence			Same as Gen. 1:1  “In the beginning”
 
b)	Divine Expression - “Logos” the spoken word
The eternal purpose was expressed
“was the word” – 
Christ the word – The personal Word, a title of the Son of God.  

  		vs. 1  He is Eternal He is Divine

(He has His own personality.) Vs. 1  The Word was with God  Vs. 2  The same was in The beginning with God.  This close union was before creation.  It cannot be said God was with Himself.  The Spoken Word “Logos” was with God.  Logos was in the same sense distinct from God.  The distinction is Father and Son.  When we say one is with another we imply there is a distinction between them.  Not an inferior being or creature but equal with the Father called by the same name, God, Creator and Word same attributes, performs same works, same honor and same in substance – Power and Glory.

## The Word and Creation -

				with God”  
				The ancient of days  Dan. 7:9,13,22

b)	Agency - vs. 3 “All things were made by Him” – “All things” relate to the universe.

1)	Its elements
2)	Its system of laws

All things came into being by Him.
			c)	Activity - “were made”  12 times in John

1096  Came into being by the word spoken (Gk.) Ginomai - to cause to be What was not came into being when He spoke vs. 3 “without Him was not anything made that was made.” Logos shared with God His position as Son and now as creator. The method of Creation - the spoken word The fact of Creation - John 1:1-3  Gen. 1:1 Heb. 1:1-3  Col. 1:15-17 “Heir of all things”  CREATOR of all things

## 3.	The Word and Life - vs. 4,5,9
			Logos and spiritual life

a)	The fountain of life - “In Him was life”
Gen 2:7  Job 33:4

			b)	The effect of life in man - “the life was the light of man”
				Prov. 20:27  Psa. 18:28  Prov. 24:20
			
c)	The power of life - “the light shineth in darkness”

d)	The scope of life - “the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”

		LIFE OF GOD			LIGHT OF MEN
	“In Him was life”			“The life was the light of men”
	
	Light is used in relation to the righteousness of God
		John 3:19,20    			12:25

	“Walk while ye have the light”
	Gen. 1:2	 Isa. 60:2 		Joel 2:2,31		 Acts 2:20
	
	John 12:35		Matt. 4:16;  27:45      Mark 15:33   Luke 23:44
	II Cor. 4:6    John 1:5; 3:19; 8:12; 12:46

	Logos brings illumination
	Jesus has provided (light) which is revelation to all men, which God has 
created.  Men can’t extinguish or dim it but can refuse it, and God will cause the light in you to become darkness.

	True light				Eternal light

		Can’t be put out by man.
		The effect is eternal life for every believer.
		John 17:2-3 – Knowing the ultimate character of God’s being.
