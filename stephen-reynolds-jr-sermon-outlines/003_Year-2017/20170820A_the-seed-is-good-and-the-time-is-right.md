> Ecclesiastes 11:1-6 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. 4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 5 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. **6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.**

## Exposition

1. vs. 1,2,6  THE COUNSEL: NOT HOARDING, BUT SOWING, careful investment
2. vs. 3 2 **Lessons**: From the Cloud=LIBERALITY; From the Trees=DEATH
3. vs. 4. Regard the clouds = not reap
4.  Vs. 5 Uncertainity, so much we don't understand our know

## The Seed Is Good

> Matthew 13:24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed **good seed** in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 
26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 

- Speak the Word - The Power in Speaking the Word
- Live the Word
- "CAST UPON THE WATERS"
- Invest in people, relationships
> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
Galatians 6:9

## The Time is Right

- don't listen to the wind
- morning vs evening, still sow
The barn, storehouse barren, wishing someone else has laid something up. Sow. EATING FROM GRANDPA'S GARDEN AS A CHILD, ONION
- don't die with seed in your hand (tree)
