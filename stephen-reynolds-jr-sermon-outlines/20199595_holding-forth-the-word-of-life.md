## Application

Time and carnal pressures cause some to lose their grip on the Word: (SLIPPING)

1. The Bible is the infallible inerrant only Word of God. Written revelation of his will to men.

2. Do not make merchandise of the Gospel. And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.
John 2:16 this is a exclusively a house of prayer.

3. Following after gain and worshipping materialism. Careful ... love not the world neither the things that are in the world ... clear and present danger that the pleasures iis this life would get a hold of us. Phil 4:13 and contentment

4. We don't bring the fire, we bring the sacrifice. On MT Carmel, (1 Kings 18:33) Elijah brought the sacrifice and (1 Kings 18:38) God brought the fire.
