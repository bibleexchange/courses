## Session 1: Marriage

- Give pen and paper

### 1. God's Blessing in a Marriage

> Genesis 2:18 &mdash; And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

> Proverbs 18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.

> Ecclesiastes 4: &mdash; 9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. 11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? 12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

- Seriousness of the Wedding Vow, Vow not a mistake

> Ecclesiastes 5:6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?

- "She's Your wife" / "He's Your Husband"

> Malachi 2:14,15 14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. 15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
