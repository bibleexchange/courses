## Session 1: Marriage

- Give pen and paper

### 1. God's Blessing in a Marriage

> Genesis 2:18 &mdash; And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

> Proverbs 18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.

> Ecclesiastes 4: &mdash; 9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. 11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? 12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

- Seriousness of the Wedding Vow, Vow not a mistake

> Ecclesiastes 5:6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?

- "She's Your wife" / "He's Your Husband"

> Malachi 2:14,15 14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. 15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.

### 2. Solid Advice

- In Engagement, If you need to then test each other, after --- NEVER!!! The marriage is not a foregone conclusion yet.
- Love is a Choice 
	- A PLAN TO LOVE EACH OTHER AND CARE FOR ONE ANOTHER 
	- Real love is an unconditional commitment to an imperfect person.
	- (lust isn't always a choice, physical attraction)
- Commit to Work 
	- Commit to always work at relationship ... Study
	- Discover and remember the things that bring you together as well as the things that pull you apart
	- Tenderness .. I love you and thank you
	- Continue to "Date" - create special moments

- Someone has to say I'm sorry
- Communication don't assume
- Enough in life will erode and whittle away at your relationship, never bad mouth

# Order of Wedding Ceremony

Music While guests arrive + Men and Joe enter with ME leading. + girls come together at back + Wed March

Greeting ( Welcome, Prayer)
Family and Friends, we are gathered here today in the presence of God as witnesses to the joining of JOSEPH and SEBRINA in marriage.
Marriage is honorable before God and a holy institution; and so is not to be entered into lightly but with reverence.
Into this SACRED TRUST these two people now come to be joined. 
If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together - let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------Please, pray with me...
Singing
 Sebrina’s dad wrote a special song for her and will now sing it to her.
<<SEBRINA WILL SING A SURPRISE SONG TO DAD>>
The Giving in Marriage
Who gives this woman to be wed to this man?
Wedding Challenge
[GOSPEL PRESENTATION]
Joseph and Sebrina share a common faith in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. This relationship with Christ is central to their relationship with each other. This will be a faithful and enduring foundation for the life they are building together.
They would like you to know Jesus as they do. All of us are born with a sin problem, missing our holy purpose. Sin weighs us down, defeats our dreams and separates us from God who is the creator of every good thing.
Romans 6:23--For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
You do not have to go another day at odds with God. Salvation is God’s free gift and Jesus will be your faithful Guide and Anchor. If you have any questions at all, please take someone aside (Joseph and Sebrina, myself and many other Believers present today) and just ask “TELL ME MORE.”
============================================================================ 
[WEDDING CHALLENGE]
Joseph and Sebrina, by the help of God, I will challenge you briefly from Genesis 2 & Genesis 29. In both of these passages, we find the saying “Bone of my Bone” and “Flesh of My Flesh”.
In Genesis 2, God had completed creating many magnificent creatures, Adam spent much time with them all naming each one, but Adam was still ALONE. God recognized this as a BAD THING.  While he is asleep, God performs surgery on Adam and takes out a rib, from which God forms Eve. Adam responds by saying “THIS is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh.”
In Genesis 29, Jacob was homeless and in the lowest point of his life. His brother hated him and so he is no the run.  He meets Rachel at well, who leave him standing -- probably nervous about bringing some stranger home to dad.
But when her dad heard about Jacob, Laban ran full speed to great Jacob, “Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.” and Jacob didn’t have to sleep outside that night.
THE CREDIT OF DESIGN goes entirely to God. God puts people together. He builds the families, he imparts the love, he ordains the times and seasons.
But the Beautiful Union, you enter into today would never happen until you RECOGNIZED each other.
1. ALWAYS RECOGNIZE its GOD’s DESIGN that brought you together and it will be your continued and MUTUAL commitment to his WILL that will KEEP you together.
2. ALWAYS RECOGNIZE you are peers and equals in the most unequal of ways. Joseph you are responsible to lead as the spiritual head of your home. Sebrina you are responsible for the spiritual direction your home will take. Your very testimony of Godly living will sanctify your home.
3. Finally, ALWAYS RECOGNIZE you belong to each other. Each other’s needs, wants, dreams, problems, issues, concerns. You share it all in common.
Odds are there will challenges ahead, but always run toward each other, “Surely, thou art my bone and my flesh.”
