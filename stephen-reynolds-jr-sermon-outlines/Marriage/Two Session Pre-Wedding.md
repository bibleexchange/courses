## Session 1: Marriage

- Give pen and paper

### 1. God's Blessing in a Marriage

> Genesis 2:18 &mdash; And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

> Proverbs 18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.

> Ecclesiastes 4: &mdash; 9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. 11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? 12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

- (Three-fold Cord) God and You and You

- Seriousness of the Wedding Vow, Vow not a mistake

> Ecclesiastes 5:6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?

- "She's Your wife" / "He's Your Husband"

> Malachi 2:14,15 14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. 15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.

	- "Take Head to your spirit"

> Ephesians 5:22-33 &mdash; Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. 24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. 25Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 27That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 28So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. 29For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 30For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 31For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. 32This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

### 4. Marriage is Difficult to do Well

#### a. Tension on Personal Self-Fulfillment ("my happiness")

	- Be Complete and Whole in yourself
	- Stress is Put on your Relationship when you are acting "too needy".
	- a successful marriage impels individuals to grow along multiple dimensions.

#### b. What will happen when the tension created by your "economic union" (To consolidate income, provide emotional sustenance, and offer a secure setting in which children can grow, etc.) is out of balance and it is no longer "financially smart" to be married?

	- all happy marriages are not alike

#### c. Marriage is an intense relationship and inevitably is often an arena for conflicts over power and authority. Highly "romanticized"  notions of togetherness, bonding, and soul mates joined togetherness fade in the everyday conflicts that pervade married life.

- ships passing in the night?
- spend surprisingly little time together ("companionship")
- career demands

#### d. Tension created by ever escalating expectations attached to marriage and the erosion of the supports that helped sustain marriages in the past.
	- Marriage, more than ever before, has become a risky endeavor, more fraught and fragile than ever.
	- Family Supports: including extended kinship relations and friendships rooted in geographical proximity. 
	- Marriage can become overtime a lonely life raft in a storm-tossed sea if you allow yourselves to become isolated.
	- Marrying each other's families.
