# Keep on the Firing Line

## Words

Verse 1

	If you’re in the battle for the Lord and right,
	Keep on the firing line;
	If you win, my brother, surely you must fight,
	Keep on the firing line;
	There are many dangers that we all must face,
	If we die still fighting it is no disgrace;
	Cowards in the service will not find a place,
	So keep on the firing line.

Verse 2

	God will only use the soldier He can trust,
	Keep on the firing line;
	If you’ll wear a crown then bear the cross you must,
	Keep on the firing line.
	Life is but to labor for the Master dear,
	Help to banish evil and to spread good cheer;
	Great you’ll be rewarded for your service here,
	So keep on the firing line.

Verse 3

	When we get to heaven, brother, we’ll be glad,
	Keep on the firing line;
	How we’ll praise the Savior for the call we had,
	Keep on the firing line;
	When we see the souls that we have helped to win,
	Leading them to Jesus, from the paths of sin,
	With a shout of welcome, we will all march in,
	So keep on the firing line.

Chorus:

	Oh, you must fight, be brave against all evil,
	Never run, nor even lag behind;
	If you would win for God and the right,
	Just keep on the firing line.

Let Me Burn Out For Thee
Bessie F. Hatcher
Oh God, the world is lost in sin,
And so few that seem to care,
Many of whom profess Thy Name, No burden will help to bear,
We need a passion, Lord, for souls,
To bring the lost back to Thee,
Our hearts must be stirred till all have heard
At least once of Calvary.
Refrain
Let me burn out for Thee, dear Lord
Burn and wear out for Thee
Don’t let me rust, or my life be a failure, my God, to Thee
Use me and all I have, dear Lord,
And hold me so close to Thee
That I feel the throb of the great heart of God
Until I burn out for Thee.
How cold has been our giving, Lord!
How selfish our love has been,
Keeping from those who never heard
The gospel that saves from sin!
How often we have turned aside
Neglecting to do our part,
Forgetting Thy tears and agony,
Forgetting Thy bleeding heart
Refrain
Meet us and break us up, dear Lord
Until driven to our knees
Bare to our gaze, Thy cross and love,
Of blood-baptized Calvary,
Speak till we hear again Thy call,
And hold nothing back from Thee.
Oh, burn on our hears the hopeless wail
Of souls damned eternally.
Refrain
O God, with shame I humbly bow,
In tears and a contrite heart.
Forgive me for the broken vows,
And failure to do my part.
I heed Thy call and say “Farewell”
To all that would hinder me;
Thy grace and Thy love to lost ones tell,
And my life burn out for Thee
