## Exhortations, vs. 1-9

### Stand Fast in the Lord, v.1

> Philippians 4 &mdash; 1 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. 

#### A. "my joy" , v.1

- "dearly beloved" belonging to Christ
- "and longed for"
- "my joy and crown"

> 1 Thessalonians 2:19,20 &mdash; For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? 20 For ye are our glory and joy.

- Paul's 'incomplete joy' : Philippians 2:2

> Philippians 2:2 &mdash; Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.

#### B. "stand fast"

In the Lord... by the Lord
- Hold the headship of Christ (vs. Bondage of the Law) 
- Previous Chapter 3:2 "Beware of dogs"
- 1 Corinthians 16:13 "Watch ye stand fast
- There is pressure to leave Christ

**DO THIS HOW**

### Be of the Same Mind, v. 2, 3

> 2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. 3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.

- Read Verses 1-3 together.
- Poisonous, Toxic Relationships (Eudius [sweet fragrance] and Syntyche [fortunate] relationship Became toxic)
	- Life Sustaining ("BUILD UNITY")
	- Joy Producing
	- Poisonous (monarch butterfly and milk weed) 
- Unresolved Conflict : "Un-Reconciled" problems (no "cant be" but "just isnt"), conflict resolution
- What could be the conflict between Euodias and Syntyche?
	
- Making Peace is a "big deal", is a priority 
	- Examples of Pauline Rebuke:
		- Galatians 2 Paul Rebukes Peter
		- Eudious and Syntche "start getting along" "not striving side by side" 2:2 "same mind same love" "agree" 3:13
		- both have responsible to resolve, "who's fault"?
		- Paul probably knows what the situation is but he doesn't say as the issue doesn't matter ultimately as that they come together
		- contrast wiht heresy and paul rebuking peter to his face
	
- Same mind "IN THE LORD" --> Not possibly in carnal ways, but YES "IN THE LORD" (Acts 2:1 Result of Unity IN THE LORD)
- Shared Commitment to what is right., Truth

	- v.3 "true yokefellow" possibly Epaphroditus?

**DO THIS HOW**

### Rejoice in the Lord, v.4

> 4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

- "Rejoice in the Lord" Php 3:1; 4:4
-  Ps 33:1; Ps 97:12; Isa 41:16; Isa 61:10; Joe 2:23; Hab 3:18; Zec 10:7; Php 4:4
- Rejoicing in the Lord as a defence against quarreling and division in the church
- Repeated: ... and again ...
	
**DO THIS HOW**

### Let Your Moderation Be Known, v.5

> 5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

	-- BE SEEN, BE KNOWN

> Matthew 5:16 &mdash;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

	-- BE MODERATE ???

STRONG #1933: 1 Timothy 3:3; Titus 3:2; James 3:17; 1 Peter 2:18

"gentleness" "considerate" "reasonableness" "graciousness" "always be gentle with others -- CEV" "gentle attitude" "forbearing spirit" "fairness" 

	-- The Lord is at hand

We can be PATIENT only if we truly believe "GOD WILL JUDGE RIGHT" for then we will not feel "I HAVE TO SET THIS RIGHT". God will VINDICATE and I do not need to SELF-JUSTIFY.

He is an omnipresent help when called. Psalm 46:5 **HE will judge US and OTHERS**. This is no time to be caught sitting in the seat of the scornful.

**DO THIS HOW**

### Do Not Be Anxious, vs.6,7

> 6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

#### 1.Anxiety and the Believer

- What does the Philippian church have to be anxious about?
- Worry, fear, anxiety, distressing, handicapping, causing dysfunction

> LEIGH ANN MARSHALL in her article "Depression, anxiety, and the church: A pastor’s wife tells her story of hope" wrote: "Since the garden, our world has been thoroughly and profoundly broken from the introduction of sin. This brokenness affects every part of our lives, from who we are, how we act, how we work, and how we relate to one another, to natural disasters and physical illness. As evangelicals, we are quick to see this universal bodily brokenness in cancer and heart disease, but when we approach mental illness, often our first response is to assume a lack of faith or inward transformation of the gospel. Why is this? ... More than 18 percent of Americans struggle with depression and anxiety, but the STIGMA and shame still holds strong in the church and even stronger for those who hold roles in ministry."

> Ashley Layne in her article "The Unspoken Anxiety in the Church." "Often times with good intentions, mature Christians may sometimes give this verse [Philippians 4:6]to individuals suffering with anxiety. ... because anxiety is not tangible we may not believe that it actually exists or we simply don’t know the best strategy to combat it. But, to the individual experiencing it, it is real and it is difficult to get through. In this case, though intentions are pure, simply quoting a bible verse may not always be the best way to approach the situation when someone confides in you with their mental health struggle."
 
> Anxiety disorders go beyond everyday stress and may sometimes involve feelings of excessive fear or worry. With anxiety, the body reacts as if danger is present when there is no actual threat. The body sounds all the alarms to the sympathetic nervous system to prepare for fight or flight, when in truth no harm is present. Approximately 44 million adults in the United States suffer from anxiety disorders and less than a 1/3 of those seek some kind of help. People do not seek out help because they feel ASHAMED or EMBARASSED.

#### 2. "Careful for Nothing"
	- **Daniel 3:16** "We are not careful" [we care not; decisive; not deliberating; minds made up, having no need to consider any further.]
	- **Matthew 6:25-33** "Take no thought for your life," [be not anxiously careful; Adam Clarke :"Prudent care is never forbidden by our Lord, but only that anxious distracting solicitude, which, by dividing the mind, and drawing it different ways..."; Do not LOSE the comfort in the things which God gives.]
	- **Matthew 10:19** "take no thought how or what ye shall speak" [Do not become anxious; God will inpsire you and you should be inspired! ]

#### 3. How Do we Read and Do Philippians 4:6?

- There being both anxiety that stems from a real circumstance particular to our mind as well as anxiety caused by something not as real but its effects being no less real, How do we avoid a reading of "condemnation" and "consternation" "Just be happy"?

- Instead of merely a command you are disobeying, Read as: "Take Comfort. Be Encouraged in... Be Hopeful and Expecting in... Consider the many reasons to trust in God. Look at the promise, not on the problem."

- The 3 Hebrew Children rested in the Sovereignty of God. (Isaiah 43:2) (Testifying on the street for the first time.) Also, they do not unnecessarily deliberate or delay. MOVE with God!
- In Matthew 6, Jesus tells us to be MINDFUL of God's care and not to LINGER on what we cannot control. "Let not your heart be troubled, John 14:1"
- In Matthew 10, Even when we have "good cause" to be nervous, Trust God above our own abilities.

- A great key to "not being anxious" is in bringing your needs to God. There is great comfort in placing your care in God's hands. "by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."

> 1 Peter 5:7 &mdash; Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

> BUT GOD by Annie Johnson Flint

I know not, but God knows; Oh, blessed rest from fear! 
All my unfolding days To Him are plain and clear.

Each anxious, puzzled "Why?" From doubt or dread that grows, 
Finds answer in this thought; I know not, but He knows.

I cannot, but God can; Oh, balm for all my care! 
The burden that I drop His hand will lift and bear,

Though eagle pinions tire -- I walk where once I ran -- 
This is my strength, to know I cannot, but God can.

I see not, but God sees; Oh, all-sufficient light! 
My dark and hidden way To Him is always bright.

My strained and peering eyes May close in restful ease, 
And I in peace may sleep; I see not, but He sees.

- Instead of rebuke, consider bringing HEALING to Each Other. "Bear Up, Comfort on another, Encourage one another" 1 Thessalonians 5:11; Hebrews 10:24,25 [Lazarus didn't believe himself out of the grave; Moses didn't preserve himself in the bulrushes; Jacob didn't fast for a vision at Bethel.]

#### 4. By Prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving

-  Prayer [GENERAL] - Solemn request to God.
-  Supplication [SPECIAL] - A stronger term than the former. It is the mode of prayer peculiarly which arises from the sense of need, or want. "to avert evils and ills." [So Jacob, when fearing Esau (Ge 32:9-12);]
- David began very often with tears, but ended with thanksgiving.

### Think on These Things, v.8

> 8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

- Not just "think" on these things, but action begins with the thought.
- Peace
	- A) A Gift passes understanding, peace of Christ, peace of God, peace with God
	- B) Cultivated
	

**DO THIS HOW**

### Do What You Know to Do, v.9

> 9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

- SEEN IN ME DO

Ensample: 1 Peter 5; Phil. 3:17; 1 Thessalonians 1:7; 2 Thessalonians 3:9; 1 Timothy 1:16; 1 Timothy 4:12; Titus 2:7; 1 Cor. 11:1; **1 Peter 2:21** 

**DO THIS HOW**

## Christian Giving, vs. 10-19

> 10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. 11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. 12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. 15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. 19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

- Paul's Grateful Acknowledgment of the Philippian church's gifts.

## Closing, vs.20-23

20 Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.
23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

- 2 "Amen"'s
