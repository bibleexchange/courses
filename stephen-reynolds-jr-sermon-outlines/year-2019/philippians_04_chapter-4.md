## Exhortations, vs. 1-9

### Stand Fast in the Lord, v.1

> Philippians 4 &mdash; 1 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. 

#### A. "my joy" , v.1

- "dearly beloved" belonging to Christ
- "and longed for"
- "my joy and crown"

> 1 Thessalonians 2:19,20 &mdash; For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? 20 For ye are our glory and joy.

- Paul's 'incomplete joy' : Philippians 2:2

> Philippians 2:2 &mdash; Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.

#### B. "stand fast"

In the Lord... by the Lord
- Hold the headship of Christ (vs. Bondage of the Law) 
- Previous Chapter 3:2 "Beware of dogs"
- 1 Corinthians 16:13 "Watch ye stand fast
- There is pressure to leave Christ

**DO THIS HOW**

### Be of the Same Mind, v. 2, 3

> 2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. 3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.

- Read Verses 1-3 together.
- Poisonous, Toxic Relationships (Eudius [sweet fragrance] and Syntyche [fortunate] relationship Became toxic)
	- Life Sustaining ("BUILD UNITY")
	- Joy Producing
	- Poisonous (monarch butterfly and milk weed) 
- Unresolved Conflict : "Un-Reconciled" problems (no "cant be" but "just isnt"), conflict resolution
- What could be the conflict between Euodias and Syntyche?
	
- Making Peace is a "big deal", is a priority 
	- Examples of Pauline Rebuke:
		- Galatians 2 Paul Rebukes Peter
		- Eudious and Syntche "start getting along" "not striving side by side" 2:2 "same mind same love" "agree" 3:13
		- both have responsible to resolve, "who's fault"?
		- Paul probably knows what the situation is but he doesn't say as the issue doesn't matter ultimately as that they come together
		- contrast wiht heresy and paul rebuking peter to his face
	
- Same mind "IN THE LORD" --> Not possibly in carnal ways, but YES "IN THE LORD" (Acts 2:1 Result of Unity IN THE LORD)
- Shared Commitment to what is right., Truth

	- v.3 "true yokefellow" possibly Epaphroditus?

**DO THIS HOW**

### Rejoice in the Lord, v.4

> 4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

- "Rejoice in the Lord" Php 3:1; 4:4
-  Ps 33:1; Ps 97:12; Isa 41:16; Isa 61:10; Joe 2:23; Hab 3:18; Zec 10:7; Php 4:4
- Rejoicing in the Lord as a defence against quarreling and division in the church
- Repeated: ... and again ...
	
**DO THIS HOW**

### Let Your Moderation Be Known, v.5

> 5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

	-- BE SEEN, BE KNOWN

> Matthew 5:16 &mdash;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

	-- BE MODERATE ???

STRONG #1933: 1 Timothy 3:3; Titus 3:2; James 3:17; 1 Peter 2:18

"gentleness" "considerate" "reasonableness" "graciousness" "always be gentle with others -- CEV" "gentle attitude" "forbearing spirit" "fairness" 

	-- The Lord is at hand

We can be PATIENT only if we truly believe "GOD WILL JUDGE RIGHT" for then we will not feel "I HAVE TO SET THIS RIGHT". God will VINDICATE and I do not need to SELF-JUSTIFY.

He is an omnipresent help when called. Psalm 46:5 **HE will judge US and OTHERS**. This is no time to be caught sitting in the seat of the scornful.

**DO THIS HOW**

### Do Not Be Anxious, vs.6,7

6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

- Daniel 3:16; Matthew 6:25-33; 10:19; 
- The key to "not being anxious" is in bringing your needs to God.
- Prayer and supplication
- Let not your heart be troubled
- What does the Philippian church have to be anxious about?
- Worry, fear, anxiety

**DO THIS HOW**

### Think on These Things, v.8

> 8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

- Not just "think" on these things, but action begins with the thought.
- Peace
	- A) A Gift passes understanding, peace of Christ, peace of God, peace with God
	- B) Cultivated
	

**DO THIS HOW**

### Do What You Know to Do, v.9

> 9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

- SEEN IN ME DO

Ensample: 1 Peter 5; Phil. 3:17; 1 Thessalonians 1:7; 2 Thessalonians 3:9; 1 Timothy 1:16; 1 Timothy 4:12; Titus 2:7; 1 Cor. 11:1; **1 Peter 2:21** 

**DO THIS HOW**

## Christian Giving, vs. 10-19

> 10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. 11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. 12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. 15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. 19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

- Paul's Grateful Acknowledgment of the Philippian church's gifts.
