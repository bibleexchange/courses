# Philippians Chapter 1

## Introduction to All the Saints, vs. 1,2

> Philippians 1:1,2 &mdash; 1 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 2 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

### Writers "Paul and Timothy"

> Philippians 1:1 &mdash; Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:

Paul with Timothy's help and the Holy Spirit's inspiration wrote the letter of Philippians. Paul possibly wrote this epistle about 10 years after his first visit to Philippi. 

> Matthew Henry &mdash; "...he [PAUL] joins Timothy with himself, to express his own humility, and put honour upon Timothy."

Phillippians is written probably during Paul's 2 year House Arrest in Rome (Acts 29:14-31). Philippians 1:3,4 Paul mentions his bonds. He was under arrest as he had made his appeal to Ceasar and was waiting an audience. This was not in a dugeon, but he was under house arrest with 1 guard and was allowed visitors and was free to share the Gospel with them. Paul made his appeal to Ceasar not for his personal defence but so that "the Gentiles will hear the gospel."

- Acts 16 - 2nd Missionary Journey with Silas: First Visit
- Acts 20 - 3rd Missionary Journey: Second Visit
- (No in Scripture) Possible 4th Missionary Journey (After Epistle written): Third Visit
- (Acts ends with Paul waiting in Rome) Followed by Second Imprisonment in Rome and Martyrdom

Paul is Hopeful and intends to visit: "I shall come shortly" (2:24). It is probable he died in Rome and didn't make it for a 3rd visit to Philippi, but Paul does recommend and send Timothy to them.

### "ALL"

- "ALL" the saints points back to Paul's purpose of encouraging the Church. 

He makes it clear that the letter he is writing is intended for "All the saints." He is inferring that for the Christian church the only qualification that really matters is to be "saints in Christ Jesus." It is also interesting that he mentions "ALL" before he does "BISHOPS and DEACONS".

> Galatians 3:28 &mdash; There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

- The Gospel is for All.

John M. Mcaleb: 

Of one the Lord has made the race, Thro’ one has come the fall;
Where sin has gone must go His grace; The Gospel is for all.

Say not the heathen are at home, Beyond we have no call,
For why should we be blest alone? The Gospel is for all.

Received ye freely, freely give, From every land they call;
Unless they hear, they cannot live: The Gospel is for all.

Refrain

The blessèd Gospel is for all, The Gospel is for all;
Where sin has gone must go His grace: The Gospel is for all.

### "SAINTS"

How many saints are there in church history? 

The saints are not a canonized list of names of dead people canonized by the Roman Catholic church, but a saint Biblically is any believer who is "in Christ" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. Saints are those who have dedicated themselves to the worship and service of the one true God as revealed through his Son, Jesus Christ.

- Holiness in character: religious, sacred, consecrated
- Morally blameless
- Physically and spiritually pure
- One set apart for Holy fellowship and service. "sanctified"

> Col 1:12 ¶ Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

> Titus 2:12 &mdash; Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;

### &quot;Grace be unto you and peace&quot;

- GRACE: God's unmerited favor. Providence.
- PEACE: Phil. 4:7; God's gift of peace is beyond human understanding

## Prayer for the Saints, vs. 3-11

> 3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: 7 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. 8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; 10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ. 11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

Ephesians 6:18; 1 Timothy 2:1; Colossians 1:19; Romans 15:30; 1 Thessalonians 5:25

> D. L Moody used to tell the story of a man who came to him and said, “When the Mexican war began I wanted to enlist. My mother, seeing I was resolved, said if I became a Christian I might go. She pleaded and prayed that I might become a Christian, but I wouldn’t. I said when the war was over I would become a Christian, but not till then.

“All her pleading was in vain, and at last, when I was going away, she took out a watch and said: My son, your father left this to me when he died. Take it, and I want you to remember that every day at 12 o’clock your mother will be praying for you. Then she gave me her Bible, and marked out passages, and put a few different references in the fly-leaf. I took the watch and the Bible just because my mother gave them. I never intended to read the Bible.

“I went off to Mexico, and one day while on a long, weary march, I took out my watch, and it was 12 o’clock. I had been gone four months, but I remembered that my mother at that hour was praying for me. Something prompted me to ask the officer to relieve me for a little while, and I stepped behind a tree away out on those plains of Mexico, and cried to the God of my mother to save me.”

God saved him, and after the Mexican war was ended, he said, “I have enlisted again to see if I can do any good for my Master’s cause.”


> The story is told about two wives who were doing their laundry in a laundry mat. They were both mending their husband’s pants.

One wife said, “My husband is so miserable. Nothing goes right at work, and he can’t find anything good on television. Our home is a place of despair. When we go to church, the song leader is terrible and the pastor is an idiot.

The other wife said “My husband is so excited.” He can’t wait to go to church. He loves the sermons. We laugh all the time and enjoy our family.

It got very quiet in the laundry room as the women continued sewing the pants. One was patching the seat of the pants, and the other was patching the knees.`

### 1. The Motivation of His Prayer

Prayer motivated by love

- **Thankful**

Thankful for You Upon Every Remembrance of You

- **Desirous of Fellowship in the Gospel**

In Every Prayer of Mine, **making request with joy** for your **fellowship in the Gospel** (from the first day until now)

1 Thessalonians 5:11 -- Build Each Other Up

Knowledge is increased by fellowship, love and truth. 1:7 &quot;Partakers of my grace&quot; 

> Luke 19:15 &quot;gained by trading&quot; 

- **Confident and Expecting**

Confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:

Spiritual Prayer: Romans 8:26; 2 Corinthians 10:4
Confident: Proverbs 15:29; Hebrews 4:16

- **Common Trial: Common Blessing**

Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, **ye all are partakers of my grace**. 

Having witnessed and benefited from their Christian Fruit, it is just and evident ye are "partakers of my grace" -- you are truly saved. To partake of this grace is to communicate the same you receive to others.

"Have you in my heart" -- Paul is warmly attached to them.

As they had fellowshipped and shared with Paul in his BONDS and in the WORK of the Gospel, they also will share in same favor of God.

> 2 Timothy 2:12 &mdash; If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: 
> Romans 8:17 &mdash; And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
> 1 Peter 4:13 &mdash; But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.

- **Personal Longing**

I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 

### 2. The Requests of His Prayer

- **I pray your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;**

Perfection of love is produced by the increase of the knowledge of the Son of God, &quot;yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment&quot; Phil. 3:10 &quot;That I may know Him&quot;

Shows our perception advancing.

Knowledge produces love but love produces greater knowledge.

- **I pray ye may approve things that are excellent**

Perfection of love produces the ability to discern.

- **I pray that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.** 

The perfection of love produces purity.

&quot;Sincere&quot; &mdash; judged by sunlight. Tested as genuine, Pure, &quot;Without offence&quot;

- **I pray you are filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.**

The perfection of love produces a fruitful life. 1:11 &quot;Being filled With the fruits of righteousness&quot;The nature of man must be changed by grace before he can bear fruit. &quot;Which are by Christ Jesus Unto the Glory and Praise of God&quot; Fruit is the Indication of the general character.

### Purpose in the Trial: Furtherance of the Gospel, vs. 12-30

- It is God's will that the Gospel be preaching everywhere to everyone.
- God uses ordinary people (young, old, male, female, gifted, simple) to spread the Gospel.
- Whose cause do we further by our manner of living?

#### The Gospel Furthered In the Midst of Persecution and False Pretenses, vs. 12-18

> 12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; 13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places; 14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 16 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: 17 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. 18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. 

1. **"I would ye should understand"**

Paul rights here desiring that the Believer's would not be offended. Paul's imprisonment might be a stumbling-block to those who had received the gospel by his ministry. They might be tempted to think, If this doctrine were indeed of God, God would not allow such treatment of Paul.

They responded to Christ's affliction with the same criticism: 

> Matthew 27:41-43 &mdash; Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, 42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

They might be timid of owning this doctrine, lest they find their own trouble through association.

2. **The Things Which Have Happened Unto Me**

> 2 Timothy 3:10-12 &mdash; 10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. 12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

- **Acts 9:29** He preached to the Hellenistic Jews and they responded with planning to kill him.
- **Acts 13:50** At <u>Antioch</u>, the Gentiles glorified God at their preaching, but the Jews controlled by jealousy drove out Paul and Silas from there coasts. ("shook off the dust of their feet")
- **Acts 14:5** At <u>Iconium</u>, "... the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles". The unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and Paul and Barnabas had to flee to escape from being stoned.
- **Acts 14:19** Jews from Antioch and Iconium Followed Paul and Barnabas to <u>Lystra</u> and stirred up the People to stone Paul. Supposing he was dead, they dragged him out of the city and left them. But as the disciple stood around him, he rose up and returned into the city.
- **Acts 16:22** At Philippi, Paul and Silas cast the devil out of the girl and were arrested, clothes rent off, beaten, whipped with many stripes and cast into prison.
- In Acts 23:10, the authorities had to hide Paul for fear the people might tear him to pieces.
- Five Times received of the Jews 39 Lashes. 2 Cor. 11:24
- 
Other passages of Paul's Persecution:   Acts 18:12, Acts 21:36, Acts 22:22, 

> 1 Corinthians 4:9-12 &mdash; For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. 10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. 11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; 12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:

3.  **"Have Fallen Out Rather" to the Furtherance of the Gospel**

Out of Great Evil, God Produced Great Good.

> 2 Timothy 2:9 &mdash; Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.

- News of Pauls Arrest and Therefore Preaching was Spread Far and Wide, v. 13
- Believers were stirred to courage and boldness, v.14 

> Job 17:7-9 &mdash; Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow. 8 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite. 9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.

- Not everyone stirred has good intentions but praise God that the Gospel is being preached!, v.15 

> 18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. 

#### The Gospel Furthered When Christ is Magnified, vs. 19-26

> 19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 20 According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 22 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. 23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: 24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. 25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 26 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. 

- Contrast this method with "Modern Ministy"
- This Evil Situation Shall "Turn" to my salvation (God's Gonna Turn it Around!)
	- Through 1) Your Prayer and 2) the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ.
- In Nothing Be Ashamed - but with all boldness
- In LIFE and DEATH magnify Christ, v.21
- Magnify Christ in ministry to HIS BODY, v.24 "is more needful for you" "for your furtherance and joy and faith"

Compare: v.12 "furtherance of the gospel" v. 24 "your furtherance"

The BODY is the light to the world and the demonstration to the world of God's grace and power. A healthy body is essential to Christ being magnified and the Gospel being furthered.

**What are some ways we can ensure a healthy BODY?**

#### The Gospel Furthered in Unity and Humility, vs. 27-30

> 27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 28 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. 29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; 30 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.

- "as it becometh the Gospel"
- Regardless of what men may or may not do, 
- Stand Fast in One Spirit (Unity and Steadfast)
- With One Mind **striving together** for the faith of the Gospel.

"Teamwork", "Workers Together", "One plants another waters", "mission work: foreign and home", "Paul and Silas, Paul and Barnabas, Paul and Timothy"

Prayer, Introducing the Presence of God, Introduction the Word of God in new places

- Fear God rather than men (Matthew 10:28  able to kill the body but not the soul)
- Your Trials seem as evidence to your enemies of your guilt, but you know that if we suffer with Him, we will also reign with Him. (2 Timothy 2:12)
- Suffering is not a mistake, but in Christ it is call to both BELIEVE on Him and to SUFFER for His sake.

> 2 Corinthians 4:17 &mdash; For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
