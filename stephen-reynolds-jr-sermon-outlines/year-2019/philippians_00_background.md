# Background to the Epistle to the Philippians

## The Purpose

The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus (Phil 2:25), with a gift as an expression of their concern to meet the needs of Paul (Phil 1:3–5, Phil 2:30, and Phil 4:10–19).

> Philippians 4:15-17 &mdash; Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

Sometime during his journey to deliver the gift to Paul, Epaphroditus contracted some life-threatening debilitating illness. At some point he recovers. 

> Philippians 2:26,27 &mdash; For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. 27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.

It is at this time, Epaphroditus shares some news of the church at Philippi: 

- The presence of spiritual conflicts in the church. (Phil 1:27–30)
- The church's immediate need for Paul's visit. (Phil 2:19–24)
- The presence of false doctrine slipping into the church. (Phil 3:2–3)
- The presence of those who usurp positions to lead away from Christ. (Phil 3:17–20)
- The current state of leadership and who is still present since Paul's visit 10 years prior. (Phil 4:2–3)
- The presence of evidence of the temptation to waver in what they had been taught and shown. (Phil 4:9)

Upon Epaphroditus' return to health, Paul sends word to the Philippians through Epaphroditus of his upcoming sentence in Rome and of his optimism in the face of death (1:18b–26), along with exhortations to imitate his capacity to rejoice in the Lord despite one's circumstances (2:14–18). 

In summary, Paul's purpose of writing this epistle was to **Thank** them for their Gift and Concern (4:10,18), **Warn of False Teachers** (3:1-3), **Warn of the Dangers of Contentious Quarreling** (1:28; 2:3), **Encourage**  (The word joy or rejoice is found in every chapter. 1:4,18,25-26; 2:2,16,18; 3:1,3; 4:1,4,10; Sin is not mentioned once; Paul intends to visit: 1:25, 26; 2:24).

## The Church At Philippi

Paul and Silas first visited Philippi in Greece during Paul's second missionary journey, which occurred between approximately 49 and 51 AD. Philippi was the location of the first Christian community established in Europe.

> Acts 16:11-15 &mdash; Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; 12 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. 13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither. 14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. 15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.

- Philippi consisted mostly of retired Roman Soldiers and their Families. Anyone born there was given automatic Roman citizenship. It was clearly a place where Roman citizenship and its benefits were understood and valued.
- The riverside prayer meeting indicates a small Jewish population as there is evidently not enough Jews to build a synagogue (Jewish law required at least 10 Jewish men in a place in order to have a synagogue.) Paul's usual custom to preach to the "Jews first" was interrupted as there was no synagogue in Philippi.
- The Leadership of the Ladies at Phillippi is significant: Lydia hosts the church in her home (Acts 16:15), and Paul credits Euodias and Syntyche as having &quot;laboured with me in the gospel&quote;.
- It was at Phillipi, Paul and Silas prayed for deliverance of a fortune telling slave girl. It was this deliverance that attracted the hatred of those who enslaved the girl and brought Paul and Silas to prison. (Acts 16:16-40)
- Paul and Silas' imprisonment, resulted in the jailer's and his family's salvation.

> Acts 16:30 &mdash; And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

- Paul leaves a testimony of courage and faithfulness to God despite injustice and even illegal treatment.

> Acts 16:37 &mdash; But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
