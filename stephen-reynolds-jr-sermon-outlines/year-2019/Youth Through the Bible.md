# Through the Bible

## Introduction

### A Bible Study Method

If I am going to do more than nibble at the truth, then I am going to need a **Bible study method**. Search, study, learn, read, seek, receive the Word of God.

2 Timothy 2:15 :STUDY; Deuteronomy 17:19 :READ; Isaiah 34:16 :SEEK; John 5:39 :SEARCH; Acts 17:11 :RECEIVED, SEARCHED; Romans 15:4 :LEARNING

Studying by topic: like "Church Customs and Practices Inspired by Scripture":
	- Nehemiah; 8:5 Standing for the Reading of the Word
	- Luke 22:19 Communion
	- Altar Call
	- Praying Aloud
	- Lifting up hands
	- Water Baptism
	- Instruments, Singing, Music in worship
	- No Swearing
	- 1 Cor. 6:19,20 No Alcohol, No Drugs
	- etc.

Verse By Verse: 1. Observe 2. Investigate 3. Apply

#### 1. READ: Observation - What does it SAY?

	- Before looking at what others have to say about it, familiarize yourself first with what the text says. Our initial focus should be on "what does the Bible say?"
	- Look up unfamiliar words
	- For difficult wording find paraphrases
	- What is NOT said? What is conspicuously missing?
	- Develop a consistent bible reading habit.
	
#### 2. RESEARCH: Investigation - What does it MEAN?

	- What did it mean to the writer/God?
	- First interpretation should be what is most direct, simple, literal
	- Before looking at what others have to say about it, familiarize yourself first with what the Scripture as a whole says about itself. Find other places a word is used or a particular subject is mentioned. The Bible generally speaking has a "built in" dictionary"
	- Introductory questions to ask when beginning a book:
		- What is the name of the book?
		- Who wrote the book? Biographical details of writer "Authorial intent"
		- When was it written? Historical setting? 
		- Who is the original intended audience?
		- What are some key words and phrases
		- What kind/category of writing is this book? History, Prophecy, Doctrinal, etc.
		- What is the length of the book so I can PLAN my study.
	- How to find answers to questions?
		- With Book Text (objective)
		- With Other Book Texts (objective)
		- Other Historical Records (objective)
		- Commentary Insights (subjective)
	- Using tools help you find other places a word is used in the Bible but perhaps translated differently.
	- What about other translations of the Bible?
	- As God chose each Biblical writer knowing their story and personality, understanding each writer is a key to understanding their writings.
	- Answering the question of Meaning requires "INTERPRETATION". (Nehemiah 9:1-7) Adding 1+1+1 to get 3.
	- What are some Bible study tools?
	- Making "unordered" lists (no particular order) while studying is helpful. You can organize and order later on in your process.

#### 3. REALIZE: Application - What can I DO with it?

	- How does it relate to me? subjective (inductive vs.deductive) 
	- All Scripture is true, but some is merely DESCRIPTIVE without being PRESCRIPTIVE.
	- Assessment is an important part of realization. Memory and Memorial.
