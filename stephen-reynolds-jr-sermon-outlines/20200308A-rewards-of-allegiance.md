# Rewards of Allegiance

TEXT: Revelation 14:9-13

> Revelation 14:9-13 &mdash; And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, **If any man worship the beast and his image**, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are **they that keep the commandments of God**, and the faith of Jesus. 13 Â¶ And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.

## Loyal to the Cause

- Allegiance speaks of loyalty or commitment to a cause.
- It reminds us of fidelity which is faithfulness to a person, cause, or belief
- Often allegiance is spoken of in the context of citizenship.

**ILLUSTRATION**: The American &lsquo;Pledge of Allegiance&rsquo; was originally written for children for a one time use in 1892. The verse intended to commemorate Columbus Day originally read:

> I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which is stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

*To date, it has undergone two changes:*
**1.** The National Flag Conference of the American Legion replaced "my Flag" with &lsquo;the Flag of the United States of America.&rsquo; in 1923. 
**2.** Secondly, in 1954 President Eisenhower signed a bill that added the words "Under God."

Daily recitation is done in schoools and places of government across America but is not compulsory, but **a mark of patriotism**.

Despite humanity&apos;s failing allegiance to God and strong arguements made to remove the words "Under God" from the American Pledge, "The Pledge of Allegiance" has served to **to strengthen, clear up and better our commitment**. 

**The intensity of the day of God&apos;s wrath will solidify the allegiances of men.** The wicked will do more wickedly, but some will sure up their allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ and even seal their testimony with their lives.

> **Joshua 24:15** &mdash;And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

Declare clearly and publicly to which cause we pledge our Allegience.

## But Two Causes

- Allegience to the Beast (vs. 9-11)
- Allegiance to the True Christ (vs. 12-13)

1. God's cause is Redemption and Restoration of all things lost through sin. 

> **Luke 19:10** &mdash; For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

2. The devil's cause is to destroy through sin which separates the creature from his Creator.

> **1 John 3:8** &mdash; He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

Our spiritual allegiance comes with a certain reward.. There is no fence in this contest for the hearts and souls of men. The athlete on the bench can celebrate because he was on the winning side, and even if a benched player on the losing side never saw a second of game-time, he, just like his other team mates, lost. Our allegiance marries us to the destiny of our cause. The devil's is a lost cause and Christ is always the victor! 

In practice, where does my allegiance lie? Whose cause do I faithfully promote? The end of THAT cause, will be my end.

## Allegiance to the Beast (vs. 9-11)

Our text details God's Judgment on the followers of the Antichrist.

### 1. The Reasons for their Judgment

Why would anyone worship the devil? In the two reasons given for their judgment, we also see the reasons for their allegiance. There are two groups who hold allegiance to the Beast.

#### a. They that Worshipped the Beast and his Image

There are those that give evidence of their fidelity to this system by worship. They honor and give service to the Beast because they are his **"true believers"**. These are loyal to the Beast's cause because they believe in it.

#### b. They that Received his Mark (forehead or hand)

Not all who make up the masses in allegiance to the Beast are so because they are sold on his ideology. Many join themselves to the enemies of God without any formal or declared intention of hostility toward God. **Many will conform out of necessity.** Many will surrender to the Beast's influence because without his mark on their hand or forehead they cannot survive in society.

> **Revelation 13:16,17** &mdash; And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

#### c. No Middle Ground

No matter the individual's reasons for aiding the devil in their life and in the world, they have chosen to side against Christ. If we are not with Christ doing what He wants, we are against him.

> **Matthew 12:30** &mdash; He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.

### 2. The Content of their Judgment

#### a. The Wine of the Wrath of God.

> Revelation 14:10&mdash;&hellip;wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of His indignation&hellip;

This judgment promised is an undiluted ("without mixture") concentration of punishment from God Almighty poured into the cup of God's anger. The offenders are then made to drink of that cup to the full.

As wine is an intoxicating and overwhelming drink so it is used in Scripture to symbolize these effects (Psalm 60:3). There is the Wine of the Spirit which is an abundant joy in Holy Ghost, but there is also the Wine of Wrath or Violence which parallels the poisoned cup of certain criminals who were obliged to drink and which caused a speedy death.

#### b. Was Not Predetermined

These will drink of the cup of God's indignation because they chose to drink of the cup of iniquity and spiritual fornication (Revelation 14:8). We are all born in sin and condemned to drink of God's wrath, but Christ died and drank that bitter cup so we would not have to (Luke 22:42).

> Hebrews 2:9&mdash;But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

#### c. Fire and Brimstone

<p>Tormented (torture, pain) with fire and brimstone (sulphur) as Sodom and Gomorrah and the rich man in hell (Luke 16:23).</p>

#### d. The Two Phases of their Judgment

##### 1. In the Presence of the Holy Angels and of the Lamb.

Presence, face, in sight of, before.

##### 2. In the Lake of Fire

> Revelation 20:10 &mdash; And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

#### e. The Duration of their Judgment

- The Smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever</h3>
- They have no rest day nor night</h3>
<p>Matthew 25:46; Mark 3:29; 2 Thessalonians 1:9</p>

## Allegiance to the True Christ (vs. 12-13)

During the day of God's Wrath **not all will be found in confederacy with devil**. They will not conform to the Beast's system for any reason at all. These are tribulation saints.

### 1. The Saint's Description

#### a. They Are Patient

2 Thessalonians 1:4; Hebrews 6:15; James 5:11; Revelation 1:9

#### b. They Keep His Commandments

They not all profess allegiance, but their loyalty is evidenced by their obedience (John 14:15).

#### c. They Have the Faith of Jesus

### 2. The Saint's Blessedness

<blockquote>Revelation 14:13b&mdash;&hellip;Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours;&hellip;</blockquote>

### 3. The Saint's Rewards

> Revelation 14:13c &mdash; &hellip;and their works do follow them.

<p>Wood, hay and stubble versus gold, silver and precious stone. Their reward is based on their motive and their faithfulness in that allegiance.</p>

<p>When missionary George Atley was killed by a band of hostile tribesmen, he was carrying a fully loaded, 10-chamber Winchester rifle. He had to choose whether to defend himself or or with his life defend the fragile mission work in that foreign land. When his body was later found in a stream, Nearby lay his rifle:all 10 chambers still loaded. He had made the supreme sacrifice, motivated by his burden for lost souls and his unswerving devotion to his Savior.</p>

<p>Writing on Philippians 1:20 in The Bible Knowledge Commentary, Robert P. Lightner said,:</p>

<blockquote class="quote">Paul's concern was not what would happen to him but what testimony would be left for his Lord. Release would allow him to continue preaching Christ. But martyrdom would also advance the cause of Christ.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Philippians 1:20&mdash;According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</blockquote>
