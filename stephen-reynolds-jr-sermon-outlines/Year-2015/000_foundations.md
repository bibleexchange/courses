# The Moral Support (Foundations)

> Isa 51:13 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor? 

> Re 21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

========================================================

## Introduction

We must be aware of the importance of a solid foundation. It's right only when the foundation is right.

> ILLUSTRATION: The tower of Pisa has been leaning so long -- nearly 840 years -- that it's natural to assume it will defy gravity forever. But the famous structure has been in danger of collapsing almost since its first brick was laid. It began leaning shortly after construction began in **1173**. Builders had only reached the third of the tower's planned eight stories when its foundation began to settle unevenly on soft soil composed of mud, sand and clay. As a result, the structure leaned slightly to the north. Laborers tried to compensate by making the columns and arches of the third story on the sinking northern side slightly taller. (by 2001)

## The Situation - The Moral Support has Seemingly Been Destroyed

> **Psalm 11:1-3** In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? 2 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 3 If the foundations be destroyed, **what can the righteous do**? 

> Psalms 12:1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. 

NOT MUCH HELP OUT THERE. Presidents? Church?

## The Solution

> **Psalm 11:4-7** The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. 7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.

### The Lord is in His Holy Temple

 He is still to be sought and found in the place where he has placed his name. Though the priests be destroyed, the God in whose worship they were employed still lives.

### The Lord's Throne is In Heaven - --- He is Still Watching ---

- his eyes behold, try the children of men, The Lord trieth the righteous,
- BUT the wicked 'his soul hateth'
- The Righteous Lord loveth righteousness.

God is intensely aware of our faith and righteousness. Are we intensely aware that YES IT MATTERS TO GOD?
