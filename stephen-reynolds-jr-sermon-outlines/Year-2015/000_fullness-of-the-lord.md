# The Full Reward of the Righteous

Psalm 16 & 
> Psalm 58:11 So that a man shall say, Verily **there is a reward for the righteous**: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth. *<<reward: fruit>>*

A minister in England was preaching to a crowd of people in a street meeting. A rough man, driving past, shouted, "Well, governor, you'll be getting a half crown for that job." Instantly, the minister replied, "No, my man, you are wrong. The Lord Jesus Christ, my Master, never gives half crowns. He gives whole crowns to those who serve Him."

--FULNESS, REPLETE, COVERED OVER

## Fullness of Preservation

David, sojourning among idolaters, and being obliged to leave his own country through Saul's persecution, cries to God for help; expresses his abhorrence of idolatry, and his desire to be again united to God's people,

> **Psalm 16:1-4** Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. 2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee; 3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. 4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.

>**ILLUSTRATION**: Henry J. Westermeyer --- Have you become discouraged? Have you allowed something to keep you from being what you know you should be? Have you allowed depression or disaster to make you lose heart and to slacken your effort? If so, remember the Word of the Lord: "That no man take thy crown." Be diligent; in season and out of season. Be faithful in the face of storm, as well as in times of sunshine, for if there is "no battle, there will be no victory; no cross, no crown."

> Re 3:11 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.

- Fully Preserved -- **nothing lost**
- David found himself in an holy place, but he was born of a holy seed!
- prayer, intercession
- A Request to kept separate
- Is it worth it? How? increasingly complicated?

## Fullness of Provision

> **Psalm 16:5-7** &mdash; The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. 6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. 7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.

- Praise, thankfulness
- Necessaary to keep an ETERNAL PERSPECTIVE

## Fullness of Power

Prophecy of the Resurrection of Christ

> **Psalm 16:8-11*** &mdash; I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. 10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.


- Where does this come from? IN a HEATHEN LAND, DAVID RECEIVED REVELATION OF Christ's Resurrection
- Fulness of Joy : glee, exceeding gladness IN HIS PRESENCE
