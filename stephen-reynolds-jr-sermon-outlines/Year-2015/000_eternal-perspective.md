# The Eternal Perspective
Psalm 90:1-17

## Introduction - 

### What is Perspective?

Point of view/vantage point (place/time/condition) from which someone sees something

Our PERSPECTIVE (place/time) greatly influences our PERCEPTION (how we see).

- Secular/Worldly Perspective
- Spiritual Perspective
- Biblical/Christian Perspective
- Christian Perspective
- Personal Perspective
- Temporal/Eternal Perspective (TIME) 

What we believe, have done, seen, and heard all influence --->
What we believe, what we do, see, and hear.

> ILLUSTRATION: TD BANK: convenience, everywhere, mobile app, etc. CONCLUSION: They like me, they are my friend ============= balance in negative, wrestling on the phone.

> After 26 Years of Marriage ---- Not necessarily affection, but familiar vs. the love of my life (We can lose sight of the value of what we have and when it gets tough think that it is not worth FIGHTING FOR.) ------------- Our PERSPECTIVE GETS KNOCKED OUT. -------------

### Healthy Perspective

**HOW SHOULD WE LOOK AT: PERSONAL & FAMILY LIFE, HEAVEN/HELL, GOD HIMSELF & SERVICE TO GOD, SOCIETY, POLITICS, TRAGEDY, etc. ?**

#### Accuracy

A "Healthy Perspective" is a matter of accuracy (getting the whole picture/ all the facts):
- If we are not STANDING in just the right place, how we see something or the opinions we form about something will be inaccurately affected.
- If we are standing in just the right place, how we see something or the opinions we form about something will be accurately affected.

> Proverbs 11:14&mdash;Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.

#### Healthy vs. Hurt Perspective

> ADVICE: Never make a major decision tired, hungry or stressed. 
> ILLUSTRATION: Position of Hurt -- > DR

Our perspective more often than not does not allow us to see the whole picture. We must therefore TRUST, RELY ON HE WHO DOES! Even after it is all said and time because before and after TIME God is!

--- **ONLY GOD** SEES the WHOLE PICTURE : The Eternal Perspective is God's Point of View ---
> Ps 90:1 &mdash; Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. <<dwelling place: refuge, place of defense>>

## The Eternal Perspective of a "Life & Time", vs. 1-9

> 3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.<to destruction: "dying man to the small dust"> 4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. 6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. 7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. 8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told. 10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.


### Eternity of God & The Frailty of Man, v.1-10
- v. 1 "in all generations"
- v. 2 "before"
- v. 2 "everlasting to everlasting"
- v. 3 "dying man" "to the small dust" (man is on a finite timeline)
- v. 3 resurrection (God is more powerful than man's limitations to time)
- v. 4 "a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past"
- v. 4 Life is compared a single watch of the night/ a thought of yestereday (what did you do yesterday?)
- v. 5 Life is compared to a stream, SLEEP (Death), grass growing (resurrection) -- The Believer's hope extends past the grave!
- v. 6 Life flourisheth (a flower) but then loses that optism, possibility -- ENDS
- v. 7 WE ARE CONSUMED: Death would not have entered the world, if men had not fallen from God!!!
- 
> "Live your life in the light of eternity."

**The Eternal Perspective on Time is that the clock/calendar/schedule is not king -- GOD IS.**

> John 1:4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

## The Eternal Perspective on "Service to God/Ministry/Church", THE PREFACE, 13-17

> 1 <<A Prayer of Moses the man of God.>> 

CHALDEAN manuscripts: "A prayer which Moses the prophet of the Lord prayed when the people of Israel had sinned in the wilderness."

> 13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. 14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. 16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. 17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
