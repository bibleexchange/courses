# Secrets of the Heart

> Psalms 44:20,21 &mdash; If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god; 21 Shall not God search this out? for He knoweth the secrets of the heart.

## Introduction
- My relationship with my parents
- My dad has always been a kind man, but a very serious man, as well. 
- Very rigid and unmoving in his convictions
- Since I can't go through it, I'd try to slide under the radar. - SECRET SIN

## The Heart is Deceitful
- "FOLLOW YOUR HEART"
- What do I want what is forbidden by God?

> Jeremiah 17:9 &mdash; The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?

- Understanding why I want things different than from what I'm taught:
- What I think I want, especially sin, becomes a curse to us.
- The Night, UNDER DARKNESS, eph. 5:12 a shame to speak of things they do in secret
- You don't really want a part of that filth

## The Heart is a Secret Place

- You can always talk to Jesus.
- Daniel 2:47 &mdash; God is a REVEALER OF SECRETS
