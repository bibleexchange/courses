# Jesus' Resurrection Sermon

## Occassion, Luke 24:1-12

> Luke 24:1-6 &mdash; Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. 3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: 5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,

Luke 24:11,12 &mdash; And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. 12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

## Congregation, Luke 24:13-24

> Luke 24:13-18 &mdash; And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? 18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?

- From Jerusalem to Emmaus was a 7 mile journey. Name meaning "hot baths or spring." Josephus "In Emmaus is a hot string useful for healing."

- One of them: Cleophas, but the other is unnamed. When recounting the events with the "stranger" in v. 22 Cleapas says, "Yea, and certain women..." or "some of the women". Was he diplomatically protecting his wife to the stranger? John 19:25 "Mary the wife of Cleophas"

- Probably walking home. v. 29

- Conversation that becomes His discples. vs. 14 

- Two talking about Jesus death and its not long before Jesus draws near. v.15

- Their eyes were prevented from identifying Jesus. v. 16 ? 
	+ Mark 16:12 "another form" / "different" [Mary thought He was the Gardener, These two men thought He was a Stranger Scribe for Doctor, ]
	+ held back, stayed, covered
	+ they did not expect to see Him

- We Hoped He was the One. v. 21

## Theme, Luke 24:25-27

Luke 24:25-27 &mdash; Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: 26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? 27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

## Text (Psalms Only)

Psalm 16 is a "Psalm of Confidence" (psalms 3, 4, 11, 16, 23, 27, 62, 115, 121, 125, 129, 131)

## Effect, Luke 24:28-34

Luke 24:28-34 &mdash; And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. 30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. 31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

- When It seemed he would journey on, they desired Him to stay. v.29
- The Guest took the bread, blessed, brake and gave it. v.30 (He was known to them in the "breaking of bread" v. 31)
- It was their eyes that were changed v. 31
- Their hearts burned within while He talked and opened Scriptures v. 32
- They returned to Jerusalem :  "The Lord is risen indeed" v. 34
