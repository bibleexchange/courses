# Hard Sayings of Jesus

Are these hard because they are difficult to understand or hard to receive?

## 1. "Eat My Flesh; Drink My Blood" (John 6:53-66)

> John 6:53-66 &mdash; 53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. 57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. 58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. 59 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. 60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? 61 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you? 62 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. 64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. 65 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. 66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.

Jesus is too often characterized as inoffensive and a bit sentimental. While the truth is many were Offended at His Word. They were offended, went back and no longer walked with Him.

- absurd, incredible, and contrary to sense and reason
- HARSHNESS in His discourse
- If you are offended at this, you won't be able to handle what I'm going to say next!

> Jeremiah 12:5 &mdash; If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?

- Would you still take offense then? (Seeing His Ascension)
- Roman Catholic say in the communion/Eucharist is the literal body ... 
- Eating His flesh and drinking His blood mean believing in Christ. We partake of Christ and his benefits by faith. We believe He is the Messiah, come in the flesh and offered a ransom for us.

> Isaiah 53:5 &mdash; But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

## 2. "Let the Dead Bury the Dead" (Luke 9:57-62)

> Luke 9:57-62 &mdash; And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. 58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. 59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. 60 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. 61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. 62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

- How could Jesus be so insensitive as to provoke a grief-stricken seeker to forego a proper burial for his parents? 
- The wording of the young man’s request means that the father was still living, and the son was asking for permission to fulfill his family duties until his father passed. 
- Jesus is heightening the urgency of his kingdom work and placing loyalty to his cause above cultural expressions of family loyalties.
- Jesus knows how to cut to the heart of the matter and expose the inner man.

## 3. Whoever Divorces and Marries Another Commits Adultery (Mark 10:11-12)

> Mark 10:11-12 &mdash; 11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. 12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.

- Elsewhere this subject is approached as contrary to the will of God
- Here is emphasized the sin and offense committed against each other.
- The Jewish culture of his day permitted a certificate of divorce for the most trivial of reasons
- the church needs to repent of its loosening the bonds of marriage. 
- This isn’t to say that divorced and remarried persons should live with perpetual shame for past mistakes. However, we should acknowledge that Jesus’ teaching here TOUCHES A SORE SPOT for his church body.

## 4. "You Must Hate Your Parents, Spouse, Siblings, and Children" (Matthew 10:37)

> Matthew 10:37 &mdash; He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

- If loving your neighbor must extend to include your enemies, how could it be that it is now restricted to exclude your family? 
- Sometimes family ties can be so consuming that it leaves us with little time or resources in the way of working for his kingdom.
- Caring for your family is an essential part of being a Christian.

> 1 Timothy 5:8 &mdash; But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

- Christ's admonision is a matter of spiritual priority that teaches us how to order our lives. (If it were to come down to GOD or THEM...)

## 5. "You Must Be Perfect" (Matthew 5:48)

> Matthew 5:48 &mdash; Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

- Obsession with physical appearance is prowess, but rejecting moral perfection. Labeling anyone striving for it as self-righteous and hypocritical.

- Jesus raises the bar on righteousness earlier in this speech (5:20), and thus points his followers to the need for an atoning sacrifice which indeed makes us whole and endows us with the Holy Spirit who enables us to fulfill God’s law. 

> Matthew 5:20 &mdash; For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Instead of despairing for having flaws, Christians may enter into the peace of Christ by his effectual work 

> Philippians 2:12,13 &mdash;  Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.

## 6. Fear Him Who Has Power to Cast into Hell (Matthew 10:28; Luke 12:4-5)

This saying doubly offends because it seemingly advocates fear, which modern Christians reject as the basis for a relationship with God (see 1 John 4:18), and because it threatens the judgment of hell, which some consider to contradict the loving character of God. 

## Moved with Fear

- Behold both Goodness and Severity of God

> Romans 11:22 &mdash; Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

- Noah Moved with Fear

> Hebrews 11:7 &mdash; By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

- Beginning of Wisdom

> Proverbs 9:10 &mdash; The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.

- By the fear of the LORD men depart from evil

> Proverbs 16:6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.

- Save with Fear

> Jude 20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, 21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. 22 And of some have compassion, making a difference: 23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

## 7. Sell What You Have (Matthew 19:21)

- Could Jesus really mean that we’re supposed to sell all that we have? 
- Is this not also modeled in the early church in Acts 2 and 4? 
- Jesus was uttering a challenge of allegiances, one which we need to hear today as well, although it may take on different forms. 
- Diligent industry is an essential part of our christianity and idleness must be stomped out.

> 1 Thessalonians 4:11 &mdash; And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

## 8. Let Him Who Has No Sword Buy One (Luke 22:36)

> Luke 22:36 &mdash; Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.

- Turn the Other Cheek
- when Peter actually follows the command literally he is rebuked by Jesus.
- This was a warning that "They were going into the midst of dangers."
