# Revival and Visitation

TEXT: Song of Solomon 4:16

> Song of Solomon 4:16 &mdash; Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

## Introduction

- The prayer is "BLOW" - "Blow upon my garden"
- The result is "FLOW" - "That the spices thereof may flow out"

## The Prayer is for the Wind of the Holy Ghost

(It brings refreshing)

> John 3:8 &mdash; The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

1. **The Wind Removes**
	- the dead stale air
	- A lot of things not needed (not raking leaves, our leaves blowing into neighbor's yard)

> Acts 2:1,2 &mdash; And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

> SOS 4:16 &mdash; Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south;  blow upon my garden,...

2. **The North Wind Brings Cold Air**

- It brings an awakening
- We have a tendancy to settle down and sleep (are we still PRESSING ON?)
- We were not born again to SLEEP

> 1 Thessalonians 5:6 &mdash; Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.

- It takes the rushing wind of the Holy Ghost to AWAKEN - AROUSE - cause to be ALERT

3. **The South Wind Brings Warm Air**

- The South Wind and the warm rain causes GROWTH
- "that the spices thereof may flow out"

4. **Notice the Order**: North Wind, then the South Wind

- A Planting then a Harvest: Harvest Time, There needs to be Maturity
- **Desert of Man** - Rock, Sand - no life - Overplanting and abuse - the wind blows

5. **That the spices thereof may flow out"**

(a) Spices of Faith - Real Faith - No known until a trial - though he slay me, yet I'll trust him
(b) Spices of Love - If we KNOW Him we WILL LOVE Him! - Know about HIM is different from knowing Him
(c) Spices of Joy - salvation should be a joy - (if other things are coming out, not pleasing to Him)

## The Prayer is for the Beloved to Visit

(speaks of fellowship and acceptance)

> Song of Solomon 4:16 &mdash;  ...  Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

1. Notice it was HER garden, Not it is HIS garden

- The moving and ministry of the Holy Ghost makes a change: We are not our own, we are His
- It is His grace that makes us what we ought to be

2. Let Him Eat

- Let Him find satisfaction in what His grace has done in us.
- Does He find pleasant fruits?
- He will purge that it may bring forth MORE fruit!
