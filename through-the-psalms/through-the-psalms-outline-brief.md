## General

Martin Luther's "From Depths of Woe I Cry to Thee" (1483-1546, #329 In the Lutheran Hymnal) inspired by Psalm 130: verse 1. From depths of woe I cry to Thee, Lord, hear me, I implore Thee.
Bend down Thy gracious ear to me, My prayer let come before Thee.
If Thou rememberest each misdeed, If each should have its rightful meed,
Who may abide Thy presence?

## Classification of Psalms

1. **Lament Psalms** contain a cry for deliverance or defense and are addressed directly to God. 
2. **Psalms of confidence** include a lament, but the ideas of security, peace, joy, and confidence predominate. 
3. **Songs of Thanksgiving** express public thanksgiving for what God has done or in anticipation of what He will do. 
4. **Psalms of Praise** are constructed around three key elements: 
5. **Enthronement Psalms** of the Divine Kingdom contain the expression “the Lord reigns” (or, in the case of Psalm 98, “the Lord, the King”), and speak of the rule of God over all the earth.
6. **Songs of Zion** extol Zion, or Jerusalem, for its exalted role as the abode of God’s glory and as the religious and political capital of the nation
7. **Royal Psalms** concern the reign of the king, either historical or messianic, or both
8. **Wisdom Psalms** emphasize the traditional teaching of the wise men of Israel: meditation of the law, the way of the righteous versus the way of the wicked, and the necessity of practical righteousness
9. **Historical Psalms** trace the history of God’s saving activity on behalf of Israel
