The metaphor was a natural one for David, the shepherd-king. It was also a common metaphor in the ancient Near East, as many kings compared themselves to shepherds in their leadership capacity. The prophecy of the coming Messiah incorporated the same (<a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Isa+40%3A11"><span class="cs1FB967ED">Isa. 40:11</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">), and Jesus identified Himself as that expected &ldquo;Good Shepherd&rdquo; (<a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+10%3A14"><span class="cs1FB967ED">John 10:14</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">).

The first blessing David experienced was spiritual nourishment. As a shepherd leads sheep to fresh grass for feeding, so the Lord leads His people. One who follows the Lord does not lack any spiritual nourishment. Under-shepherds (cf. <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ac+20%3A28"><span class="cs1FB967ED">Acts 20:28</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">; <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Pe+5%3A2"><span class="cs1FB967ED">1 Peter 5:2</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">) are expected to feed the flock (<a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Eze+34%3A1-10"><span class="cs1FB967ED">Ezek. 34:1-10</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">; <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Jn+21%3A15-17"><span class="cs1FB967ED">John 21:15-17</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">) as well. Food for the soul is the Word of God (<a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+5%3A12-14"><span class="cs1FB967ED">Heb. 5:12-14</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">; <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Pe+2%3A2"><span class="cs1FB967ED">1 Peter 2:2</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">).</span></p><p class="cs8C270430"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs8C270430"><span class="csA7555675"><a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+23%3A2-3"><span class="cs265927AF">23:2b-3a</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">. A second blessing that comes from the Lord&rsquo;s leading is spiritual restoration. As a shepherd leads his sheep to placid </span><span class="csFF5D0528">waters</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> for rest and cleansing, so the Lord </span><span class="csFF5D0528">restores</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> or refreshes the </span><span class="csFF5D0528">soul.</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> Here the spiritual lesson is clear: the Lord provides forgiveness and peace for those who follow Him.</span></p><p class="cs8C270430"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs8C270430"><span class="csA7555675"><a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+23%3A3"><span class="cs265927AF">23:3b</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">. The third blessing that comes from the Lord&rsquo;s leading is guidance </span><span class="csFF5D0528">in</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> the right way (</span><span class="csFF5D0528">paths of righteousness</span><span class="csE16F8BF1">). A good shepherd knows the right paths on which to bring the sheep home safely. So too the Lord loses none of His sheep, but guides them in the right way. He does so partly because of His reputation (</span><span class="csFF5D0528">for His name&rsquo;s sake</span><span class="csE16F8BF1">).</span></p><p class="cs8C270430"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs8C270430"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs8C270430"><span class="csA7555675"><a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+23%3A4"><span class="cs265927AF">23:4</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">. The fourth blessing from the Lord&rsquo;s leading is protection. If one finds himself in a </span><span class="csFF5D0528">valley of</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> deep darkness (or </span><span class="csFF5D0528">shadow of death</span><span class="csE16F8BF1">), he need not </span><span class="csFF5D0528">fear.</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> The Lord is </span><span class="csFF5D0528">with</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> him and will protect him. The </span><span class="csFF5D0528">rod</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> and </span><span class="csFF5D0528">staff</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> are the shepherd&rsquo;s equipment to protect the sheep in such situations. David was comforted by the Lord&rsquo;s presence and protection. Believers are never in situations the Lord is not aware of, for He never leaves or forsakes His people (cf. <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Heb+13%3A5"><span class="cs1FB967ED">Heb. 13:5</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">).</span></p><p class="cs8C270430"><span class="csA7555675"><a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+23%3A5"><span class="cs265927AF">23:5</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">. In this verse the scene changes to a banquet hall where a gracious host provides lavish hospitality. Under this imagery the psalmist rejoiced in the Lord&rsquo;s provision. What was comforting to David was that this was </span><span class="csFF5D0528">in the presence of</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> his </span><span class="csFF5D0528">enemies.</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> Despite impending danger, the Lord spread out </span><span class="csFF5D0528">a</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> </span><span class="csFF5D0528">table</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> for him, that is, God provided for him. The image of anointing the </span><span class="csFF5D0528">head with oil,</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> which was refreshing and soothing, harmonizes with the concept of a gracious host welcoming someone into his home. In view of the table and the oil David knew that his lot in life (his </span><span class="csFF5D0528">cup</span><span class="csE16F8BF1">) was abundant blessing from the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs8C270430"><span class="csA7555675"><a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+23%3A6"><span class="cs265927AF">23:6</span></a></span><span class="csFF5D0528">.</span><span class="csA7555675"> </span><span class="csE16F8BF1">David realized that the Lord&rsquo;s good loyal </span><span class="csFF5D0528">love</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> (</span><span class="csFD3B997">ḥesed̠</span><span class="csE16F8BF1">) would go with him everywhere through </span><span class="csFF5D0528">all </span><span class="csE16F8BF1">his </span><span class="csFF5D0528">life.</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> God&rsquo;s blessings on His people remain with them no matter what their circumstance may be.

So he concluded </span><span class="csFF5D0528">I will dwell in the house of the </span><span class="csDE2B147">Lord</span><span class="csFF5D0528"> forever.</span><span class="csE16F8BF1"> The house of the Lord referred to the sanctuary (tabernacle). For the rest of his life (lit., &ldquo;length of days&rdquo;) he would enjoy full communion with the Lord. In fact the Hebrew verb translated &ldquo;I will dwell&rdquo; conveys the idea of returning; the same verb is translated &ldquo;He restores&rdquo; in <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+23%3A3"><span class="cs1FB967ED">23:3</span></a></span><span class="csE16F8BF1">. Perhaps the psalmist was in some way separated from the sanctuary and full enjoyment of its spiritual benefits. His meditation on the Lord&rsquo;s leading and provisions prompted him to recall his communion with the Lord in His presence, in the sanctuary.</span></p><p class="cs57DD9D3E"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs25CEDD1A"><span class="csE16F8BF1">What did he mean when he said, &quot;I shall not want&quot;? Our first thought might be that David meant he had every physical provision that he needed. But is that really what he was saying in the passage? Keep in mind that David may have written this passage sometime before he became king. He had not yet been blessed with the wealth and power that would come in his later years. I propose a different interpretation. I believe that David was not making a statement about material desires here. Instead, he was boldly stating who he chose to follow. He is saying to us, &quot;God is my Shepherd, my Leader. I do not want any other leader. I am giving Him my unflinching loyalty and devotion.&quot; When interpreted that way, the words become a daring and forthright statement of faith. David had many influences around him. He could have chosen to follow so many different people or ideals. He could have chosen to curry favor with King Saul or even gain favor with his father over his older brothers. Instead, David tells us that he served God alone. There are so many people or things to follow these days. People chase after money, power, or prestige. Some people hang on every word of their favorite celebrity, taking it as absolute truth. Like David, we are surrounded by countless influences. Who or what we follow is a choice. Christ tells us that we can have only one master (Luke 16:13). If we choose the wrong leader, we will be led astray (cf. Jer. 50:6) and beguiled into sinful actions. When we do this, we place ourselves outside of God&#39;s protection. False shepherds lead us into places of barrenness. We find ourselves desperately trying to do what we cannot, </span></p><p class="cs25CEDD1A"><span class="csE16F8BF1">We are content and happy only when we allow Christ to be our Shepherd. He is the only one who knows every minute thing about each of us. He leads us down the right path, satisfying every need. Under His graceful guidance, our souls can find rest (cf. Matt. 11:28). Who is your Shepherd today? Before you give an automatic response, stop and ponder the question. Can you, like David, honestly say that you are not following anyone or anything else? Or has a false shepherd edged its way into His place? If so, is it not time to return to His flock?</span></p><p class="cs57DD9D3E"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs550128D4">

		<p class="cs2E76836D"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E76836D"><span class="csE16F8BF1">Shepherding was a common occupation in ancient Israel through the centuries (Genesis 12:16; 26:14; 29:9; 30:31, 32; Jeremiah 33:12; Luke 2:8; etc.). It should not surprise us, then, that the Bible has scores of references to sheep and shepherds. Sheep were completely dependent on shepherds, making the job of shepherding what we would call 24/7 (note Luke 2:8, which has shepherds &ldquo;keeping watch over their flock at night&rdquo;).</span><span class="csA7555675"> </span><span class="csE16F8BF1">Since all this was so familiar to the ancient Israelites, the words shepherd and sheep became metaphors. Moses and David, two of Israel&rsquo;s greatest leaders, had been shepherds in the normal sense (Exodus 3:1; 1 Samuel 16:11) before they became figurative shepherds of God&rsquo;s people (compare Psalm 77:20; Isaiah 63:11; Ezekiel 34:23; etc.). The Old Testament describes God himself with the metaphor of shepherd (Psalm 78:52; 80:1; Isaiah 40:11). In the New Testament, it is Jesus who is &ldquo;that great Shepherd of the sheep&rdquo; (Hebrews 13:20; compare John 10:1-16; 1 Peter 5:4).</span><span class="csA7555675"> </span><span class="csE16F8BF1">The psalms are traditionally seen as five books, and Psalm 23 is in Book I. This psalm is part of an early collection of Davidic psalms, namely Psalms 3-41. A later Davidic collection, namely Psalms 51-65 and 68-70, is found in Book II. Our approach to Psalm 23 is in terms of two metaphors: shepherd (vv. 1-4) and host (vv. 5, 6).</span></p><p class="cs57DD9D3E"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs4CEB16C3">

When spiritually fatigued, God restores passion to his faith and energy to his zeal. Sheep need a shepherd not only to provide suitable times and places for rest, but to provide guidance along the paths. Sheep will stray without a shepherd (cf. Mark 6:34).

		<p class="cs25CEDD1A"><span class="csE16F8BF1">During the cold war, the United States Air Force&rsquo;s Strategic Air Command kept loaded B-52 bombers continuously &ldquo;on alert,&rdquo; and an airborne command post flying every day, seven days per week, twenty-four hours per day. The necessity of flying every day, in any weather, required the ability to land the airborne command post in any weather. In dense fog, Air Force flight controllers had to talk this large jet all the way down to the runway. The pilots had to listen carefully to the controllers, follow their directions exactly, and trust the controllers implicitly. Flying blind like that was not for the fainthearted. In a very real sense, though, every person alive is flying blind. No one can see into the next year, the next week, even the next hour. People hurtle blindly into the future, hoping they can negotiate whatever obstacles or difficulties present themselves. In Psalm 23, David assures us that the Lord, our Shepherd, is willing to serve as our air traffic controller. He will guide us in the paths of righteousness. Like a controller with a radar screen, He can see where we are headed and what lies ahead even though we cannot. Like a pilot flying in fog, every person needs to listen carefully to this Controller, follow His directions exactly, and trust Him implicitly. Those who do this will find that the Lord will guide them to a safe landing. Those who do not will crash and burn.</span></p><h4 class="cs5D9EA0BC" style="tab-stops:left 54pt;">

However, a face to face encounter with one&rsquo;s own death can change a person&rsquo;s sense of values. &ldquo;I realized there were things more important than _______&rdquo; (fill in the blank). An encounter with death takes us to the core of our being. Amidst the darkness of this valley, David&rsquo;s core being felt comforted. Even at the threshold of the grave, David sensed God&rsquo;s reassuring presence. A public television documentary several years ago followed two terminally ill hospital patients. Both patients&rsquo; families were grief-stricken by the news that death was imminent. However, over the ensuing weeks, one family pulled together and found peace. The other family pulled apart and found nothing but pain. The first family had a living relationship with Christ; the second family did not. You are terminal. Beyond insurance policies and a will, what are you doing to prepare yourself? David recommends you walk through this dark valley with the Lord. Then, you need fear no evil.</span></p><h4 class="cs5D9EA0BC" style="tab-stops:left 54pt;">

He makes them lie down because he knows that they cannot properly digest their food unless the lie down.&nbsp; He also knows that sheep will not lie down unless they feel perfectly safe from enemy attack.&nbsp;

In the water, their wool fills with water and they easily flip over and drown.&nbsp; The sheep know this and shy away from running water.&nbsp; The shepherd knows this and searches out placid pools for them to drink from.&nbsp;
