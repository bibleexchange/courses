Just prior to any impending storm of judgment, the Lord always commands his prophets to warn the people to return to him: </span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">Ho 12:6 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets. </span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">God is faithful to speak in times of prosperity, just before the fury of his judgment strikes. While the storm clouds are still gathering he raises up prophetic voices all over the land. And, according to Scripture, whenever a sinful nation was prosperous and at peace, God told his prophets to warn that the good times soon would end: </span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">Zec 1:4 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain? </span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">Zec 7:9 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csC05134DD">At times God made his message strong, instructing his spokesmen to make their warnings searing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said through Hosea, </span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">Ho 6:5 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">God says, The word I send you will be so clear it will smite you </span><span class="cs87110596">if </span><span class="csC05134DD">your heart is open at all, It will cause you to fall on your face and repent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">God&rsquo;s purpose in calling us back to himself is to protect us in the time of storm.

This was especially true if a prophet cried out about a coming storm over a period of years and that society continued to be prosperous and at peace. Over time the people began to turn off the prophet&rsquo;s voice. They simply didn&rsquo;t want to hear it anymore.</span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">Isa 30:10 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:</span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">Can you imagine ever falling to such a condition? These people knew Isaiah was telling the truth&mdash;that a great storm was coming&mdash;but they got tired of hearing about it. They preferred to hear &ldquo;smooth things.&rdquo; The Hebrew word for &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; here means &ldquo;pleasant, unperturbed.&rdquo; They were telling Isaiah, in other words, Don&rsquo;t preach anything to us that will upset the status quo or make us nervous.</span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">This condition has crept into the church today.

What disaster or calamity is left to shock us?</span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">God sees the response among his people! We see this in the warnings of the prophet Ezekiel. At the time Ezekiel prophesied, Israel was prosperous and at peace with the surrounding nations. Yet the Lord told Ezekiel to give the people this message: </span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">Eze 33:28 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through. &nbsp;29 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.</span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">The prophet went up and down the land preaching God&rsquo;s warnings over several years. But the people grew weary of listening to him. Over all that time not one of Ezekiel&rsquo;s words had come to pass. On the contrary, the nation only grew more prosperous.</span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">At some point Ezekiel&rsquo;s prophecies became a source of entertainment for the people.

But, like Israel, we are only experiencing the calm before the storm.</span></p><p class="cs4007D1A3"><span class="csC05134DD">While Moses spent forty days on the mountaintop, Israel indulged in a spirit of lawlessness. Likewise today, Christians by the multiple thousands are casting off the yoke of Christ, tossing aside all limits and restrictions. This attitude is prevalent in many Christian books and magazines.

Listen to these very clear warnings, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2Co 11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2Co 11:13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Heb 10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thank God - The true and faithful watchmen on the wall will never compromise! They will not stop warning the righteous about the seductions and infiltrations of the wicked one among God&#39;s people. No sincere Christian need be in doubt about who to listen to in these days of many voices. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are two very clear and unmistakable tests of all prophetic warnings: </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csF1D8F393"><span class="csCF6BBF71">True prophecy seeks to turn Christians away from sin. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jer 23:22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span></p><p class="cs19E5A0DF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Heed the voice of those who seek to turn you away from wickedness. Avoid those who speak soothing words with no reference to sin. </span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csF1D8F393"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Prophetic warnings, from the beginning, spoke of judgments upon the wicked. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jer 28:7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. </span></p><p class="cs19E5A0DF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Those who warn of coming judgment are in good company. They speak the same word of all the prophets &quot;from the beginning.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The warnings now going forth from God&#39;s holy watchmen are the greatest evidences of His love to this generation. He loves His people enough to prepare them; to give them time to repent and prepare the way of the Lord in holiness! Those who love the Lord will be thankful. Those who are at ease in Zion will be repelled and rebell. There is nothing worse than to have the false prophets out doing the true prophets.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ps 86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
