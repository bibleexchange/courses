<p class="fancy"><span>April 15, 2018</span></p>

## Introduction

(Psalms 8, 19, 29, 33, 100, 103, 104, 111, 113, 114, 117, 135, 136, 145 – 150)

The **Psalms of Praise** are constructed around three key elements: 

1. A call to praise or introduction

2. A cause for praise (usually for God’s attributes or deeds)

3. A conclusion

Psalm is organized into five books. Each book concludes with a doxology, with the entire book of Psalms capped by Psalm 150, a grand ascribing of praise to God.

- Book 1 - 1-41 &mdash; DOXOLOGY: 41:13  
- Book 2 - 42-72 &mdash; DOXOLOGY:  72:18,19 
- Book 3 - 73-89  &mdash; DOXOLOGY:  89:52
- Book 4 - 90-106 &mdash; DOXOLOGY:  106:48
- Book 5 - 107-150 &mdash; DOXOLOGY:  150

## Commmaded to Praise

At least 250 times we can find declarative statements regarding praising God in the Bible.

We are to say praiseworthy things of God. Not just: "Praise God", "Hallelujah".

> HALLELUJAH: praise ye Jehovah, frequently rendered "Praise ye the LORD," stands at the beginning of ten of the psalms (106,111-113,135,146-150), hence called "hallelujah psalms." The Greek form of the word (alleluia) is found in Revelation 19:1,3,4,6.

Praise is not a feeling, but is a conscious and thoughtful action of extolling God for who He is and what He has done. While singing even a simple song thoughtfully consider God in his love, mercy, holiness, magnificence, etc.

> Psalm 117:1-2 &mdash; 1 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
2 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.

> Psalm 150:2 &mdash; Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.

## What is Praiseworthy about God?

PRAISEWORTHY: deserving approval and admiration.

> Philippians 4:8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
