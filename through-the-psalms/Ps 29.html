It is foolish to unleash our feelings, thoughts, and opinions all at once and to lose our tempers.

As a result, his throne usually becomes secure and he reigns a long time. The reason: the integrity of just rulers assures God&rsquo;s favor upon a nation and brings stability to a society.

They inherit a nature that will, at times, behave selfishly, rebel, become angry, and commit a host of other mischievous and sometimes harmful acts (<a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Pr+22%3A15"><span class="csE2DF19C1">22:15</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Of course, the older the child, the more serious the behavior. Only discipline can unbind children from their foolishness and make room in their hearts for wisdom. The </span><span class="csC382D2BB">rod</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> refers to physical punishment or spanking. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Reproof</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is verbal correction. It is not enough to instruct our children in wisdom and only verbally correct them when they err. Our teaching must be accompanied by physical discipline. Children do not have an innate desire to do right; therefore, they must learn that disobedient and sinful behavior results in punishment. If we spare the rod, we will experience the stabbing pain and humiliation of rearing unwise and foolish children. A wise parent will use mild spanking as a tool to teach children to avoid disobedient (lawless), sinful, and harmful behavior. This is the unmistakable teaching of God Himself. </span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes&rdquo; (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Pr.13:24</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Foolishness </span><span class="csC382D2BB">is</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> bound in the heart of a child; </span><span class="csC382D2BB">but</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the rod of correction shall drive it far from him&rdquo; (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Pr.22:15</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth&rdquo; (He.</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">12:6</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csE2DF19C1">V. 16</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The wicked cause the spread of sin, but the righteous will witness their downfall.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The prosperity of the wicked has vexed God&rsquo;s people for generations (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Ps.2:1</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; Je.</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">12:1</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). In a world (community, society, or nation) where Satan reigns, sin runs rampant and wicked people thrive. Sometimes, we live to see the wicked&rsquo;s demise, but often we do not. However, we should never despair, for God&rsquo;s Word repeatedly casts our eyes to the promise of a future day when all enemies will be conquered (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Ps.37:34</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">91:8</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).

If we are wise parents, we will chasten our children. We will lovingly, but firmly, fulfill our sacred duty to the Lord by directing our children to the path of life.

It is most unwise to pamper workers, especially when they are first hired.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At the same time, other Scripture teaches that righteous employers care about their employees (see outline and notes&mdash;Ep.</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">6:5-9</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, for more discussion). They value dedicated and productive workers who give their best efforts and make sacrifices for the business. They are fair and considerate of their needs. When the cost of living increases, they increase their wages accordingly. When an employee goes beyond and does more than what is required, wise employers show their appreciation and reward him or her accordingly. Upright employers never try to take advantage of an employee by getting as much work as possible from the individual for as little money as possible. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Righteous, wise employers and employees show mutual respect and appreciation for each other.

God&rsquo;s Word is certainly not silent concerning what behavior is acceptable in the world and what is not. In this particular section, Solomon points out several key areas we should monitor closely in our lives: </span></p><p class="cs2ED0A7B5"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">we need to control our tempers and our tongues at all times (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">vv. 11</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">20</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">22</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). </span></p><p class="cs2ED0A7B5"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">we must refuse to associate with sinful people and criminals (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">v. 24</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). </span></p><p class="cs2ED0A7B5"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">we need to humble ourselves before the Lord and seek to serve rather than be served (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">v. 23</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs2ED0A7B5"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">we need to saturate ourselves with God&rsquo;s Word. It will keep us on the right path and help us to guard against sinful, unwise behavior (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">v. 18</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). </span></p><p class="cs2ED0A7B5"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">we need to be loving and consistent in disciplining our children. We have to be faithful in fulfilling our often painful duty of chastening them in order that they will be wise. This is crucial to the continuing success of our society. One undisciplined generation can destroy a nation (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">vv. 15</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">17</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). </span></p><p class="cs2ED0A7B5"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">we need to choose leaders (when possible) who maintain a high standard of integrity, leaders who have nothing to do with dishonesty and dishonest people. We need to support officials who cannot be influenced by money or promises of gain, and insist that they be fair and merciful to the poor (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">vv. 12-14</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). </span></p><p class="cs201AA7B5"><span class="csD5A3EC7A">&rArr;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">we need to be firm and fair with those who work under us. We cannot allow emotional attachment to employees to cause us to be lenient toward them. We have to understand that we harm ourselves, our employees, and ultimately our nation when we fail to hold the workforce to a high standard of performance (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">vv. 19</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">21</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="csDA7538C7"><a name="31_a29prov1_3"><span class="cs37B91BCF">3.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (</span></a><span class="csE2DF19C1">29:25-27</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) Their desire for security and justice. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If we are wise, we have an unwavering faith in the Lord. We do not fret when threatened by evildoers, and we are not desperate when wrong prevails. Instead, we trust in the Lord and believe what He says and promises. In doing so, we develop a strong faith that enables us to rest in Him and to wait for Him to keep His Word.</span></p><p class="csCDDC8C82"><span class="csE2DF19C1">V. 25</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The righteous trust the Lord and are protected by Him. The wicked are trapped by their fear of men.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If we have trusted in the Lord, we will live righteously&mdash;do the right thing regardless of the consequences. We will not be afraid of what people may think or do because of our stand for what is right. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Fear</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (acharadah) means to tremble with terror. We fall into a dangerous trap if we allow a fear of other people to possess us. Fear will compel us to lie, keep silent, bow down, give in, or compromise to avoid any unpleasant repercussions or retribution. Abraham lied and betrayed his wife because he was afraid of Pharoah and Abimelech (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Ge.12</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+20"><span class="csE2DF19C1">20</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Peter denied Christ because he was afraid of what people might do to him (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Mt.26:69-75</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus has warned us: if we are truly faithful to Him and His Word, we will be persecuted (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Jn.15:18-21</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). It is impossible to live for Christ and avoid persecution (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">2 Ti.3:12</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). Being faithful to God&rsquo;s Word and living righteously may cost us a promotion or even our jobs. It may even affect our relationships with friends and family. In some places persecution is as mild as being mocked or ridiculed; whereas, in other countries, loyalty to Christ and God&rsquo;s Word may cost us our freedom or even our lives. Someplace, every day, faithful believers are slain for the cause of Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you truly trust in the Lord, you will not cower at the feet of men. Christ will strengthen you, enabling you to stand boldly. When threatened, just call upon Him and do not retreat. Stand firm; refuse to be intimidated by others. Be assured that you are in God&rsquo;s hands and that He is in control of your life. Know that He is all-powerful and that He is greater than your enemies. Your security is in His providential care. Even if He allows you to suffer loss or harm, maintain your trust in Him (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Jb.13:15</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">). </span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;So that we may boldly say, The Lord </span><span class="csC382D2BB">is</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me&rdquo; (He.</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">13:6</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him&rdquo; (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Jb.13:15</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me&rdquo; (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Ps.56:11</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;If it be </span><span class="csC382D2BB">so</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver </span><span class="csC382D2BB">us</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> out of thine hand, O king.

The wicked seek the favor of rulers. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When we trust the Lord, we do not fret when justice is not served in human courts. Confidence in the Lord frees us from the driving compulsion for vengeance. Why? Because we believe what God says: He is the ultimate and final judge. Faith releases us to rest in His Word and power. It enables us to suffer loss with peace because we know that God will do what is right. A day is coming when He will correct all the wrongs done on earth and execute perfect justice. However, there are many who place their trust in government officials for justice. But as we all know, human government cannot bring perfect justice to earth. When we trust the Lord, though, we can rest assured that He will balance all the scales in His time.</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but </span><span class="csC382D2BB">rather</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance </span><span class="csC382D2BB">is</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> mine; I will repay, saith the Lord&rdquo; (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Ro.12:19</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&rdquo; (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Ge.18:25</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: </span><span class="csC382D2BB">yet</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> surely my judgment </span><span class="csC382D2BB">is</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> with the Lord, and my work with my God&rdquo; (Is.</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">49:4</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csE2DF19C1">V. 27</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The righteous detest the lifestyle of the wicked, and the wicked detest the righteous.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When we walk in God&rsquo;s righteousness, we refuse to compromise with evil and deceitful people.

God does not ignore the sins of His children. He reproves us when we disobey Him. Our Heavenly Father is longsuffering and patient with us, and He offers many rebukes&mdash;many opportunities for repentance. But the Lord will not allow us to willfully continue in sin. He will never simply accept it or overlook it.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If we are stiff-necked and hardhearted toward our sin, we may eventually cross a line where God&rsquo;s patience is exhausted. At this point, God may take us suddenly&mdash;instantly, unexpectedly&mdash;Because of our persistence in sin, He may choose to allow our earthly life to end as the final step of chastisement. The fact that this is an act of judgment cannot be ignored, but it is also an act of love. Note the teaching of the New Testament concerning this final step of chastisement:</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus&rdquo; (</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">1 Co.5:5</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">).</span></p><p class="csDA507A21"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;For this cause many </span><span class="csC382D2BB">are</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.

Sometimes God may remove His hand of protection and allow some sickness, accident, or tragedy to claim our lives.

The teaching of Scripture is clear: God will not allow us&mdash;His genuine sons and daughters&mdash;to continue in sin (See outline and notes&mdash;</span><span class="csE2DF19C1">Ac.5:5-6</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">1 Co.5:3-5</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; </span><span class="csE2DF19C1">1 Co.11:30</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> for more discussion.

Hezekiah&rsquo;s men surely selected this proverb as a national warning to backslidden Judah.
