# Introduction to the Book of Psalms

<p class="fancy"><span>March 11, 2018</span></p>

## General

- The book was originally titled Tehillim, which means “praise songs” in Hebrew. The English title of “Psalms” originated from the Septuagint’s Greek title Psalmoi, also meaning “songs of praise.”
- the writing of the book spans one thousand years. 
- The poetry was often set to music—but not always.
- In such a collection of hymns, a widely divergent range of dates is inevitable: from the oldest, the Psalm of Moses (90), to a number of postexilic psalms, or a period of about one thousand years (1400 – 400 B.C.), to the late sixth or early fifth century B.C. post-Exilic period (Psalm 126).

## Authorship

Psalms is a composite work containing multiple authors. Some psalms name their author in the first line or title. 

- Moses wrote 1 (Psalm 90). 
- David wrote 73 
- Asaph wrote 3 (Psalms 50, 73-83) 
- Sons of Korah wrote 10 (Psalms 42, 44-49, 84, 85, 87) (likely performers rather than authors)
- Solomon wrote 2 (Psalms 72, 127);
- Ethan the Ezrahite wrote 1 (Psalm 89)
- Heman the Ezrahite wrote 1 (Psalm 88) 
- Sixty-one psalms are anonymous

## Classification of Psalms


- pilgrim: include the title “a song of ascent” and were used on pilgrimages “going up” to Jerusalem for three annual festivals. 

1. **Lament Psalms** contain a cry for deliverance or defense and are addressed directly to God. 
 - They may be individual (Chapters 5-7, 13, 17, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 51, 54-57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 69-71, 86, 88, 102, 109, 120, 130, 140-143). 
 - Or national (Chapters 12, 44, 58, 60, 74, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 90, 94, 106, 108, 123, 126, 137).

2. **Psalms of confidence** include a lament, but the ideas of security, peace, joy, and confidence predominate. 
- They may be individual (Chapters 3, 4, 11, 16, 23, 27, 62, 121, 131)
- or national (Chapters 115, 125, 129).

3. **Songs of Thanksgiving** express public thanksgiving for what God has done or in anticipation of what He will do. 
- They may be individual (Chapters 9, 10, 30, 32, 34, 40, 41, 92, 107, 116, 138), 
- or national (Chapters 65-68, 118, 124).

4. **Psalms of Praise** are constructed around three key elements: 
- a call to praise or introduction, 
- a cause for praise (usually for God’s attributes or deeds), and 
- a conclusion (Chapters 8, 19, 29, 33, 100, 103, 104, 111, 113, 114, 117, 135, 136, 145 – 150)

5. **Enthronement Psalms** of the Divine Kingdom contain the expression “the Lord reigns” (or, in the case of Psalm 98, “the Lord, the King”), and speak of the rule of God over all the earth. They are prophetic of Christ’s kingly rule (Chapters 47, 93, 96 – 99).

6. **Songs of Zion** extol Zion, or Jerusalem, for its exalted role as the abode of God’s glory and as the religious and political capital of the nation (Chapters 15, 24, 46, 48, 50, 76, 81, 84, 87, 95, 122, 134). The Pilgrim Psalms (see below), are sometimes included here, but they do not really constitute a distinct literary type. 

7. **Royal Psalms** concern the reign of the king, either historical or messianic, or both (Chapters 2, 18, 20, 21, 45, 72, 89, 101, 110, 132, 144).

8. **Wisdom Psalms** emphasize the traditional teaching of the wise men of Israel: meditation of the law, the way of the righteous versus the way of the wicked, and the necessity of practical righteousness (Chapters 1, 14, 37, 49, 52, 53, 73, 75, 91, 112, 119, 127, 128, 133, 139).

9. **Historical Psalms** trace the history of God’s saving activity on behalf of Israel (Chapters 78, 105).

## Other categories, identified strictly for content, overlap with the above. These include the following:

1. **Messianic Psalms** are prophetic in some way of the Messiah. They include psalms in which the righteous man’s character is a type of Christ (34:20; 69:4, 9), the righteous man’s experience foreshadows Christ’s experience (22), the existing king’s ideals and calling will be fulfilled in Christ, the ultimate King (Chapters 2, 45, 72), Christ’s work is prophesied with no contemporary reference (only 110), or the enthronement of Christ as universal King over the earth is predicted (Chapters 47, 93, 96 – 99).

2. **Imprecatory Psalms** contain an imprecation or prayer for retributive justice to fall on one’s enemy (Chapters 35, 55, 58, 59, 69, 83, 109, 137, 140). These may be justified by remembering that the Israelites were building a political kingdom and, as long as evil men triumphed over them, God’s rule was thwarted. The psalmists were concerned primarily with the glory of God, and at the very least, they did put the matter into God’s hands for His just dealing. These prayers are actually in the same spirit as the petition “Thy kingdom come” (Matt. 6:10), because the coming of God’s kingdom includes the destruction of the wicked (see the note on Psalm 109).

3. **Pilgrim Psalms** Song of Ascents is a title given to fifteen of the Psalms, 120–134, each starting with the ascription Shir Hama'aloth. They are also variously called Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps or Pilgrim Songs. Four of them (122, 124, 131 and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one (127) to Solomon. Psalms of Ascents were sung by pilgrims journeying up to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.

4. **Acrostic Psalms** are those in which each verse begins with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet (Chapters 9, 10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, 145). Psalm 119 is in a class by itself with eight verses for each letter of the alphabet.

## Peculiar Language

The psalms include unique Hebrew terms. The word Selah, found seventy-one times, is most likely a musical notation added by worship leaders after the Israelites incorporated the psalm into public worship. Scholars do not know the meaning of maskil, found in thirteen psalms. 

Occasionally, a psalm appears with instructions for the song leader. These and others can refer to melodies used with the given psalm or perhaps to suggestions for liturgical use. For example, we see instructions such as:

-  “For the director of music” (occurring in fifty-five psalms; 
-  “To the tune of ‘Lilies’” (similar references found in Psalms 45, 60, 69, 80)
-  “To the tune of ‘The Doe of the Morning’ ” (Psalm 22); 
-  “To the tune of ‘Do Not Destroy’ ” (Psalms 57–59, 75). 

The identification of many of the technical words in the superscriptions is dubious. The headings include names for types of psalms (“a psalm”), musical terms (“to the chief musician”), melody indicators (“upon Shoshannim”, 45), and liturgical indicators (“for the Sabbath day”, 92). Fourteen psalms contain historical superscriptions that give some brief mention of the occasion on which the psalm was written (Chapters 3, 7, 18, 30, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, 142).

## Organization

The psalms are organized into five books or collections. They were probably collected gradually, as corporate worship forms developed along with temple worship. It is likely that by the time of Ezra, the books of the Psalter were organized into their final form. Each section concludes with a doxology, with the entire Psalter capped by Psalm 150, a grand doxology.

|pentateuch	    | Genesis      | Exodus       | Leviticus    | Numbers      |Deuteronomy   |

The five-fold arrangement has long been recognized, but no explanation for its origin has proved satisfactory. The most common is the early Jewish tradition that judged the five books to be an imitation of the five books of Moses.
