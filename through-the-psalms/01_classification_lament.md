(Read Psalm 64. David's whole life characterized by the type of struggles descriped and not not a specific occasion inspires this psalm.)

## Voicing Frustration to God

(Read Psalm 13)

> Psalm 13:1 &mdash; How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

How is this different from the grumbling against him, of the Israelites when they journeyed from Egypt to the Promised Land?

> Numbers 14:22 &mdash; Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;

- The Israelites spoke about God (as it were) behind his back. They spoke as if they had given up on God.

- The complaints of the psalmists are spoken directly to God. The psalmists have not given up on God but are expressing the opposite of that. 

- Whatever real emotions they had they present to God, but in the context of asking for help and hoping that he would answer them in their distress.

> Hebrews 4:13 &mdash; Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

> Psalm 139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.

## Believing in Deliverance by God

> Psalm 27:13 &mdash; I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.

(Read Psalm 108)
