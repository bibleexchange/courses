They are impressed by external miracles. They eagerly seek for healing and for material blessings. Most of their prayers are related to earthly matters. They want to see God act on their behalf and bless them in the physical realm. They are in a state of spiritual childhood.<br/><br/>Eternal life is to know the only true God and Jesus Christ Jn.17:3<br/><br/>Eternal life does not refer to eternal existence. Eternal life is but another phrase for God&#39;s life and nature.<br/><br/>Eternal existence will be experienced by all human beings - even by those who go to hell. But very few enjoy eternal life. The more we know God and the Lord Jesus the more we will have of eternal life.<br/><br/>In the days of Moses, few understand God&#39;s ways. Today, under the new covenant, that privilege is offered to all of us.<br/><br/>Yet few know God and His ways, because most believers are taken up only with God&#39;s external actions. And when they experience an external miracle like getting a job, or earning more money, or getting a new house, or finding a wife or a husband, or experiencing healing, they are excited and are quick to testify about these matters, because these are the greatest things in life for them.<br/><br/>If these are the things that still excite us, then we have not seen the glory of the new covenant.<br/><br/></span><span class="csA521DC07">One mark of those who are mature is that they are NOT taken up with God&#39;s external acts as much as with knowing God and understanding His Extraordinary Longsuffering ways.</span><span class="cs75A07D5F"><br/><br/>It is only when we understand God and His </span><span class="csA521DC07">Extraordinary Longsuffering </span><span class="cs75A07D5F">ways that we will be able, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs75A07D5F">to discern between what glorifies God and what does not,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs75A07D5F">to understand Holiness and the Mind of Christ.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs75A07D5F">And to understand what &quot;worldliness&quot; really is.<br/><br/>Many believers think of worldliness as something external, such as wearing lipstick and ornaments and fancy clothes or having expensive electronic gadgets in the home <br/><br/>But Romans 12:2 makes it clear that </span><span class="csF42C4B08">conformity to the world is found in a person&#39;s mind</span><span class="cs75A07D5F">. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs75A07D5F">It is in a person&#39;s mind that he has to resist conformity to the world and to be renewed so as to understand the perfect will of God.<br/><br/>A person may get rid of all the external marks of worldliness and have a good testimony before men, and yet be thoroughly worldly in his way of thinking.<br/><br/>Most believers&#39; definition of &quot;worldliness&quot; depends on their own standard of living!! They feel that whatever they themselves possess of this world&#39;s goods does not make them worldly. But if anyone possesses more than them then such a person IS worldly! And when their own standard of living goes up, their gauge of what is worldly is adjusted upwards accordingly!<br/><br/>No believer is the perfect standard. Jesus alone is our Standard. To recognize worldliness, we must know Jesus Christ. Only in the </span><span class="csF42C4B08">light of His life</span><span class="cs75A07D5F"> can we see what is worldly and what is not.<br/><br/>The Pharisees became self-righteous in their pursuit of righteousness because they did not know God. They pursued righteousness without hungering and thirsting after God Himself.<br/><br/>We don&rsquo;t get rid of Pharisaism merely by avoiding the acts of the Pharisees. We can get rid of those marks from our lives, but that would be only snipping off the fruit from a bad tree. The bad fruit will again appear again.<br/><br/>A believer can spend his entire life merely snipping off various fruits of Pharisaism from his life and end up as a greater Pharisee at the end than he was at the beginning of his Christian life!<br/><br/>When we know God however, we will realize that the only way to be saved from self-righteousness is by </span><span class="csF42C4B08">chopping the tree down from the roots</span><span class="cs75A07D5F"> itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crucify the flesh - Say no to self<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs75A07D5F">When you know Jesus Christ you will yield yourself as a servant of God to Jesus Christ&rsquo;s life.<br/><br/>The only way to escape deception is by knowing the Lord.

We need therefore to ask ourselves whether we are willing to pay this price for partaking of the Divine nature.<br/><br/>Our Adamic nature is the exact opposite of this Divine nature. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The life of Adam is thoroughly selfish and makes us alert only to our own needs and to the needs of our own family members. <br/><br/>When man sinned, God placed cherubs in front of the tree of life with a sword that turned in every direction to guard the way to that tree. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The tree of life symbolizes eternal life - knowing God.<br/><br/>The sword placed in front of the tree of life, symbolically shows </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">if anyone now wanted to partake of the tree of life, he had to first experience the sword falling on his own selfish life.<br/><br/>Ge 3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Adam and Eve sinned, God killed an animal in Eden and clothed them with coats of the skin.

Can you also say that you desire the very best for other believers whom you know in other denominations? Then widen the circle still further and ask yourself if you desire the very best for all the people whom you know, including your relatives, your enemies and those who have harmed you in any way.<br/><br/>If you find a disturbance in your heart (instead of a rejoicing) when something good happens to another person or to his children, or if you sense a rejoicing in your heart (instead of a grief) when something evil happens to him or his family, what do such attitudes indicate? Just this that the life of Adam is alive and active in you.<br/><br/>If you are honest with yourself, you will soon discover whether you are walking the way of Cain or not. You must be quick when you see that evil Adamic life within you to put it to death, if you want the fire and the anointing of God to rest upon you constantly.<br/><br/>It is when the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies TOTALLY, that there will be much fruit. One who dies totally to himself will never get offended, no matter what others do or don&#39;t do. He will always intend well towards all. He will never get angry in any matter that concerns himself and he will never quarrel with anyone. He will never shed a single tear for himself in self-pity - for, surely, dead people don&#39;t weep in their graves!!<br/><br/>Cain&#39;s face was down and dark when he did not intend well towards his brother </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ge 4:6 &para; And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">We may not realise it, but the attitude we have in our hearts is often reflected on our faces. If you intend well towards all, your face will always beam with the joy of the Lord.<br/><br/>Many believers are walking in the way of Cain. Beneath their weak smiles and the &quot;Praise the Lord&quot;s that come from their lips, are found wrong attitudes towards their fellow-believers.<br/><br/>When people turn against you and do evil to you, God uses them to give you a scan of your real heart condition. If you cannot love them, your heart- scan will show that you have NOT partaken of God&#39;s nature, for God&#39;s nature is one that loves even His enemies. Jesus intended well even towards Judas Iscariot.<br/><br/>God desires the very best for all people. The gospel message is that we too can partake of this nature. Those who don&#39;t, don&#39;t understood the gospel. <br/>When Adam and Eve sinned, God did not curse them. He cursed the serpent. But to Adam and Eve, He gave that wonderful promise of the coming of Christ as &quot;the seed of the woman&quot; (Gen.3:15) to crush the serpent&#39;s head. In the process, Christ&#39;s heel itself would be bruised. That would be the price He paid in order to save Adam&#39;s race from their sins.<br/><br/>This is Divine love - a love that is willing to lay down its life in order to save the one it loves.<br/><br/>When we see the depth of the love of God, we see how far short of it we come ourselves. We can never produce this life of God ourselves, even if we strive after it for a million years. It has to be given to us by God. The Holy Spirit has come down to flood our hearts with this love (Rom.5:5).<br/><br/>Only one who is willing to live by this principle of sacrificial love can be used by God to build His church on earth.<br/><br/>In 2 Chronicles 3:1, we read that &quot;Solomon began to build the house of the Lord on Mount Moriah&quot;. Mount Moriah was the place where Abraham had offered his son Isaac to God (Gen22). There on that mountain Abraham understood God&#39;s way as the way of sacrifice and submitted to it. God sanctified that spot and determined that His house would be built on that very spot 1000 years later. And this is where God builds His house (the church) even today - wherever he finds those who have the spirit and the faith of Abraham.<br/><br/>On Mount Moriah, Abraham was symbolically saying exactly the opposite of what Adam and Eve had told God in Eden.<br/><br/>In Eden, Adam and Eve as it were, told God by their action of eating the forbidden fruit that created things that brought them pleasure were more precious to them than the Creator Himself. And that is exactly what billions of human beings are saying to God even today. &quot;They worship and serve created things more than the Creator&quot; (Rom.1:25).<br/><br/>Abraham said the opposite: that his God and his Creator was more precious to him than his dearest possession on earth (Isaac). And he was willing to sacrifice Isaac in order to prove it. God will honour all who live by this principle of sacrifice. &nbsp;The true house of God is going to be built even today.<br/><br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">On Calvary&#39;s hill, Jesus died for the sins of the world. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">There, Jesus demonstrated the principle of obedience, longsuffering (sacrifice) by which God does all His work. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">No-one</span><span class="csA521DC07"> can serve the Lord in any other way than through obedience longsuffering (sacrifice)<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">John 17:19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07"><br/>Those who seek for a comfortable life in this world and at the same time want to build the church also, will only deceive themselves.

From early morning to late at night and right through the night, a mother sacrifices and sacrifices and sacrifices for her baby. And she gets nothing in return. She endures pain and inconvenience, year after year for her child, joyfully, expecting nothing in return. That is how God loves us too. And that is the nature He wants to impart to us.<br/><br/>But it is impossible to find a fellowship anywhere in the world about which it can be honestly said that they all love one another like that.<br/><br/>Most believers know only how to love those who agree with them and who join their group. Their love is human and is far removed from the sacrificial love of mothers!!<br/><br/>Yet Divine love is the goal towards which we should be striving. So each time we sing the above lines, we should not only honestly admit that our love is not yet like that, but also confess our hope and longing that our love will become like that one day.<br/><br/>A mother does not care whether others around her are sacrificing anything for her child or not. She joyfully sacrifices everything herself. In the same way, one who has seen the church as his own baby will not be bothered whether others around him are sacrificing anything for the church or not. He will sacrifice himself joyfully, and he will have NO complaint or demand against anyone else.<br/><br/>Those who complain that others are not sacrificing for the sake of the church are not mothers but hired nurses. Such nurses have fixed working hours and will complain when the nurse for the next 8-hour shift does not come on time.<br/><br/>But a mother does not work 8-hour shifts each day. She works a 24-hour shift daily - year after year - and she does not even get paid for it. Even when her child is 20 years old, the mother&#39;s work is not over!!<br/><br/>Only mothers can have milk for their babies every day. Nurses cannot produce milk for the babies they care for. In the same way, those who are like mothers in the church will always have a word for their spiritual children - in every meeting. Many elders have no word for the church because they are nurses, not mothers.<br/><br/>A mother does not expect any payment from her children. No child ever pays its mother for her service. In fact, if you were to calculate the wages a mother should be paid, at the rate of Rs.20 per hour (as paid to nurses), you will find that every child owes its mother more than 3 million rupees, by the time it is 20 years old!! Which child can ever repay such an amount to its mother?<br/><br/>Now the question that comes to us is: Who is willing to work like that for the Lord and for His church - without receiving any payment, but giving oneself, day after day, year after year, until Jesus comes?<br/><br/>If God can find just one person with that spirit anywhere, He will use him to build the church, much more than He can use 10,000 half-hearted believers who try to serve Him without the spirit of sacrifice.<br/><br/>Wake up before it is too late, and ask God to show you that His way is the way of sacrifice.<br/></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span

Having seen the great</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">acts of the Lord, they readily gave in to impatience when he did not anticipate their</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">needs. In his &lsquo;</span><span class="csD3860DFD">counsel</span><span class="csA521DC07">&rsquo; the Great King knew what to do and when, but Israel&rsquo;s refusal to</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">submit to his counsel signified an independence that would develop into the spiritual</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">anemic condition of being stiff-necked and stubborn. They murmured about food and</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">water (Exod 15:22-25; 16:1-17:7). In their lust they devoured the quail without proper</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">preparation (Num 11; Ps 78:28-29). Thus they &lsquo;</span><span class="csD3860DFD">put God to the test</span><span class="csA521DC07">&rsquo; (v.14; cf. 78:18) with</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">their selfish spirit, as expressed in Numbers 11:5-6. He gave them what they wanted; but</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">their craving ended in sickness, and their impatience rushed them to a premature death</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">(v.15; cf.

This is the basis of the final</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">prayer (47), and this gives reality to the doxology that closes not only the psalm but the</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">fourth Book of the Psalter (Pss. 90-106).&rdquo;</span></p></body>
