That was the token or symbol. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">2Co 5:18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ&#39;s stead, be ye reconciled to God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Reconciliation contains two requirements. </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs2AD95BA6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God was reconciled to the believer in Christ&#39;s obedience and perfect atonement. From God&#39;s side, reconciliation is fully in place for whosoever will believe. The penalty has been paid; perfect obedience has been restored. The law was perfectly satisfied. This is God&#39;s view of every believer in Christ. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Secondly, our hearts must be circumcised to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, and mind. God is reconciled to the world; now we must be reconciled to God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The only thing that now stands between God and us in reconciliation is, &quot;be ye reconciled to God.&quot; Our own rebellious heart is the problem. It is still there. By nature, we are dead in trespasses and sin; we need the Lord to regenerate our hearts. We need our rebellion broken and our hearts brought into subjection to the will of God. That takes the grace of God. Here is where we see God&rsquo;s sovereign grace in our salvation. It isn&#39;t in the fact that the atonement is limited; it is in the fact that our rebellion must be broken and &quot;be ye reconciled to God.&quot; All the fault now lays with you and me; there is no fault on God&#39;s side. The atonement is sufficient to cover every repented sin, but our hearts are still in rebellion against God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Obedience to the Law is through the liberty we find in Christ.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Obedience to Christ is Perfection</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Heb 2:10 &para; For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Heb 5:9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Joh 19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christ&#39;s pledge of perfect obedience under the covenant of circumcision was fulfilled, Jesus &nbsp;finished what He came to do. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Resurrection of Christ, not circumcision, is the pledge, that God the Father has accepted. The perfect obedience of Christ is imputed now to us by the righteousness of faith . </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Now we look unto the resurrection of Christ as the Father&#39;s acceptance of His perfect obedience and atonement. In the resurrection of Christ, we have the pledge of the Father&#39;s acceptance; the law has been satisfied. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Our faith must be centered in the resurrection of Christ. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our faith must be centered in the resurrection of Christ because He was raised for our justification. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The law has one great demand, and that is obedience! If a man disobeys and is punished, he does not thereby escape from the duty of obedience. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We cannot be saved without repentance. Just because Christ has satisfied the law does not give us a license to disobey the law. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Lu 13:3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We must repent and we must obey, how much more so.</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs79659084">Know the Full Power of the Anointing</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Since we are imperfect beings, somewhat of the evil and the unpleasant is sure to intrude; but this will readily be neutralized and easily ejected by the true love of the saints, if it really exists. Christian unity is good in itself, good for ourselves, good for the brethren, good for our converts, good for the outside world; and for certain it is pleasant; for a loving heart must have pleasure and give pleasure in associating with others of like nature. A church united for years in earnest service of the Lord is a well of goodness and joy to all those who dwell round about it.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs80275571">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Eph 4:2 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs80275571">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">Ps 29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful;
