God has given you, by that most sure word of testimony, the clearest possible evidence, life in Christ already. If you are asking for some further assuring word, to soothe your fears to rest, turn to the Bible, for there is in it the very word you need. So, seek it out, for I may truly say God&#39;s revelation is in this blessed Book,&mdash; <br/><img src="Ps%20108%20(2)_files/image0.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /> Possibly, the very thing that you have been praying for so long, you may already have obtained; and God may not intend you to pray any longer about it, but may say to you, as he did to Moses</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csEF2D250D">Ex 14:15 &para; And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csEF2D250D">Believe that you have the blessing for which you are asking, and go forward in that belief. The time for praying about it has passed; this is the time for grasping the blessing by faith, and using it to my praise and glory.&quot; So it seems to me, in our text, that David had prayed, and then suddenly recollected that he had already received the very thing for which he had asked. So he shakes himself from the dust, and cries, confidently and jubilantly, &quot;God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.&quot;<br/><img src="Ps%20108%20(2)_files/image1.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" />I.

You, dear friend, have not enjoyed the means of grace as you used to do. You blame yourself for the change, and it is right and proper that you should do so. You have not now those happy experiences that you once had; neither do you enjoy such blessed visits from your Lord as you had a year or so ago. You know that the fault lies with you; still, remember that faith is never dependent upon feeling, and our confidence is never to rest upon our inward condition. </span></li></ul>

Some Christian people are living, spiritually, on a penny a week, when their income might be ten thousand a day. You might live like kings, yet you are starving like paupers. Your faith might lay hold on God&#39;s exceeding great and precious promises, and so fill her mouth with good things; but, instead of doing so, you are quivering with the palsy of unbelief, and so not grasping what God has put within your reach. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csEF2D250D">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csEF2D250D">There lies Succoth, but you do not mete it out. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csEF2D250D">There lies Shechem, but you do not divide it. Yet they are both of them yours by divine promise. Let your faith grip the promises, and believe in the promise-keeping God, she would never rest till she possessed all the blessings that are really hers! I think that every young Christian should say when he joins the church, &quot;Now, I do not want to be merely an average Christian. I am nothing, and less than nothing, in myself; but, if there is any blessing to be had from God I will have it. If I can have a closer walk with God than others have, I will have it. If there is more of Christ&#39;s likeness to be had than others possess, I will have it.

Be no longer like the starveling professors that, now and then, taste a little of the heavenly manna; but, generally, live on the leeks, and the garlic, and the onions of Egypt.<br/></span><span><img src="Ps%20108%20(2)_files/image15.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span><span class="csEF2D250D">So, if we have faith in God, we ought to take possession of all that is ours, and, further, </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">we ought to know what we really do possess.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> It is delightful to see David here mentioning his various possessions:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csEF2D250D">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csEF2D250D">&nbsp;&quot;I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

He had seen Shechem, and he knew that it was a place worth possessing; and Gilead, and Manasseh, and all the other places interested him, if they do not interest you. And when a child of God looks over his spiritual treasures, and mentions them one by one, he takes an interest even in the very mention of them. The Bible is a dull book to a person who has no part or lot in it. There is no drier reading, in all the world, than the reading of a will in which one has no interest; but there is nothing that would interest you more than listening to the will of your old uncle, in which he had left you a large fortune. You would lean forward, and you would put your hand to your ear lest you should lose any of it, and you would think that you had never heard a more eloquent discourse than that, and when a man gets to know what &quot;God hath spoken,&quot; what he hath written for him in this blessed Book, which contains his will, every word is music to him, and he is ready to pick out some of the choicest words, and say, &quot;Regeneration is mine; justification is mine; adoption is mine; sanctification is mine; union to Christ is mine; resurrection is mine; eternal life is mine; yea, all things are mine;&quot; and he would dwell upon each one with a holy unction, at least to his own soul.<br/></span><span><img src="Ps%20108%20(2)_files/image16.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span><span class="csEF2D250D">Then, if you know what God has given you, </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">mind that you use it all.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> What does David say? &quot;Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csEF2D250D">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csEF2D250D">As an Oriental, who is weary, throws his sandals to one servant, and then puts his foot out, that another servant may lave it with flowing water, so David says, &quot;I will use Moab and Edom as my servitors.&quot; Now, Christian man, if you have true faith, and mean to do real business with God, and for him, say to yourself, &quot;I have this, and that, and the other blessing, and I am going to use them all for his glory. Then I also have sanctification given me in Christ; so I will use that, and seek to be a true saint, that my life may be a blameless, holy, gracious, Christ-like life. By God&#39;s grace, I will not have even one unused privilege.<br/></span><span><img src="Ps%20108%20(2)_files/image17.gif" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span><span class="csEF2D250D"> &quot;God has given me Edom; then I will have it.

I wonder, brothers and sisters, how many of you have any readiness for God in view just now,&mdash;storming some rocky sin, some Petra-like evil in your soul, that seems almost impregnable.

Have you &quot;pluck&quot; enough to undertake such an enterprise as that? Is there manliness enough in any one of you to attempt it?
