A tremendous religious revival took place during Hezekiah&#39;s reign and, under his guidance, temple worship was restored and a great Passover was kept.

The number fifteen corresponds with the number of years that were added to Hezekiah&#39;s life. He seems to have written ten of the fifteen himself.

We live in a complex universe. The more we know, the less we know. The field of medicine provides an example. A doctor who was an expert on diabetes said to a group of medical men he was addressing at a convention some years ago, that in spite of all the research he and others had done, they really knew little about the disease. He confessed to his colleagues, &quot;Every time I get the answer to one question I have about this disease, it only raises another hundred questions to which I do not have the answer.&quot; When he sat down, the chairman thanked his learned colleague for &quot;casting so much darkness on the subject.&quot; God conceals; man seeks out the answers.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">God conceals the secrets of the atom, and man seeks them out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the center of the atom is made up of positively charged protons. Like charges repel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This law can be easily demonstrated by trying to bring together the positive poles of two magnets. Since they always push apart, it seems that the center of the atom should disintegrate&mdash;but it doesn&#39;t. For many years scientists referred to the force that holds the center of the atom together as unknown and mysterious. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">A greater mystery that God has concealed is the mystery of life itself. In seeking out the answers, man has discovered that each human body contains more than a million million (1,000,000,000,000) cells; that each living cell contains as many as two hundred trillion tiny groups of atoms called molecules; that the nucleus of each cell is less than four-thousandths of an inch in diameter; and that each cell&#39;s components are enclosed in a membrane only one-half of a millionth of an inch thick. Man has explored the master plan&mdash;that is, the code of life or blueprint carried by DNA. He has probed deeper and discovered chromosomes and genes. He has learned that genes contain instructions for making the particular kinds of protein that are the building blocks of life. He has even learned how to make artificial protein, manage genetic engineering, clone, and mutate life. Man has discovered much, but thousands of questions remain unanswered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greatest of all mysteries </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">God has concealed</span><span class="csA521DC07"> is the </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">mystery of Spiritual life</span><span class="csA521DC07">.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/></span><span class="csA521DC07">This life is in His Son &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joh 6:53 ; 1Jo 5:11</span></p></body>
