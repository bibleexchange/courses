Selah.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;8 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Pr 7:1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;4 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;12 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;14 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;19 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;24 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;27 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Ps 7:1 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">2Ti 4:17 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me;
