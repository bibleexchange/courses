He did not employ himself in studies too high; he made God&#39;s word his meditation, and did not amuse himself with matters of nice speculation or doubtful disputation, or covet to be wise above what is written. To know God and our duty is learning sufficiently high for us. He did not employ himself in affairs too great; he followed his ewes, and never set up for a politician; no, nor for a soldier; for, when his brethren went to the wars, he staid at home to keep the sheep. It is our wisdom, and will be our praise, to keep within our sphere, and not to intrude into things which we have not seen, or meddle with that which does not belong to us. &nbsp;Princes and scholars must not exercise themselves in matters too great, too high, for men: and those in a low station, and of ordinary capacities, must not pretend to that which is out of their reach, and which they were not cut out for. Those will fall under due shame that affect undue honours. </span></li></ol>

He was well reconciled to every condition that God placed him in (Ps 131:2): I have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother. As he had not proudly aimed at the kingdom, so, since God had appointed him to it, he had not behaved insolently towards any, nor been restless in his attempts to get the crown before the time set; but, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">(1.) He had been as humble as a little child about the age of a weanling, as manageable and governable, and as far from aiming at high things; as entirely at God&#39;s disposal as the child at the disposal of the mother or nurse; as far from taking state upon him, though anointed to be king, or valuing himself upon the prospect of his future advancement, as a child in the arms. Our Saviour has taught us humility by this comparison (Mt 18:3); we must become as little children. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">But, by the grace of God, a soul that is sanctified, is weaned from those things. Providence puts wormwood upon the breast, and that helps to wean us. The child is perhaps cross and fretful while it is in the weaning and thinks itself undone when it has lost the breast. But in a day or two it is forgotten; the fret is over, and it accommodates itself well enough to a new way of feeding, cares no longer for milk, but can bear strong meat. Thus does a gracious soul quiet itself under the loss of that which it loved and disappointment in that which it hoped for, and is easy whatever happens, lives, and lives comfortably, upon God and the covenant- grace,. then our souls are as a weaned child. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">a man who is weaned from self thinks of others!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7C96B97">&nbsp; II. Confidence in God; and this David recommends to all Israel of God, no doubt from his own experience of the benefit of it (Ps 131:3): Let Israel hope in the Lord, and let them continue to do so henceforth and for ever. Though David could himself wait patiently and quietly for the crown designed him, yet perhaps Israel, the people whose darling he was, would be ready to attempt something in favour of him before the time; and therefore endeavours to quiet them too, and bids them hope in the Lord that they should see a happy change of the face of affairs in due time. &nbsp;Thus it is good to hope and quietly to wait for the salvation of the Lord.</span></p></body>
