class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;3 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with

righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;7 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet

diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;12 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. </span></p><p

open his folly. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;17 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span

shall be repayed.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;22 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children&#39;s children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;23 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.</span></p><p

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Pr 13:1 &para; A wise son heareth his father&#39;s instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In 1977 two of the world&#39;s richest men died: Howard Hughes, who was worth $2.5 billion, and J. Paul Getty, who was worth nearly $4 billion. Howard Hughes is an example of the first part of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Pr+13%3A7"><span class="cs92015F65">Proverbs 13:7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Hughes inherited his father&#39;s tool company and used the profits from this business to launch a career in Hollywood. He went on to build the planes he designed at the Hughes Aircraft Company. He turned a small airline into the giant Trans World Airlines.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">At the peak of his success, Hughes began to retire from the world, although he still ruled his empire with an iron hand. He became increasingly suspicious of other people and paranoid about catching infections. Relying on his staff for contact with the outside world, he lived mostly in hotels, where he closed off entire floors and sealed and darkened all the windows. In spite of his eccentricities, he prospered. Wealth rolled in from defense contracts, airlines, gambling casinos, and other ventures. In his final years, however, Hughes lived in his pajamas and ate a diet of fudge. When he died he was suffering from malnutrition and weighed about ninety pounds.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">No less than thirty wills showed up after his death, some of them obvious forgeries. One man who claimed to be his son said he was born in a flying saucer in 1946! The Mormons laid claim to a sizable portion of his estate. At his funeral service the officiating priest, quoting <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Ti+6%3A7"><span class="cs92015F65">1 Timothy 6:7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, said, &quot;We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.&quot; To paraphrase Solomon, Howard Hughes made himself rich, but he had nothing.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In contrast to Howard Hughes, Charles T. Studd is an example of the second part of <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Pr+13%3A7"><span class="cs92015F65">Proverbs 13:7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. While attending Cambridge University he was converted under the ministry of D. L. Moody. Studd was born to affluence, but he gave away his considerable fortune and went to China as a missionary. There he shocked the British civil service by donning Chinese garb, eating with the Chinese, substituting Chinese ways for western ways, and trying to identify himself with the nationals. When his health broke down so severely that he was unable to return to China, he went to India! Later in an effort to open up Africa from the Nile to the Niger, he led an intrepid band of Christian workers into the Congo forests. His motto was very simple:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs111983FF"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Some wish to live within the sound</span></p><p class="cs111983FF"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Of Church or Chapel bell,</span></p><p class="cs111983FF"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">I want to run a Rescue Shop</span></p><p class="cs111983FF"><span class="csF8E5A0D2">Within a yard of hell.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some eighteen years later, when the mission he had founded was beset with financial problems because of the great depression, C. T. Studd declared to the mission board:</span></p><p class="cs44694EDE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I would lay before you the absolute necessity of nobody, man or woman, coming out here who does not recognize the absolute necessity of super-sacrifice of self, and demand it. If people want pretty houses and elegant furnishings, for God&#39;s sake and ours, let them stay at home in the nursery... no soldier is worth a rap unless he does not care whether he lives or dies, so long as he dies fighting for the glory of God. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.&quot; It does not take much discernment to know who has more now&mdash;Howard Hughes or C. T. Studd! As previously mentioned, the priest who officiated at Howard Hughes&#39; funeral service quoted <a class="cs955DD547" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Ti+6%3A7"><span class="cs92015F65">1 Timothy 6:7</span></a></span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: &quot;We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.&quot; While those words are true, in one sense it </span><span class="csC382D2BB">is</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> possible to carry something out of this world. At least it is possible to send our riches on ahead. That is what C. T. Studd did with his.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/></span></p><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
