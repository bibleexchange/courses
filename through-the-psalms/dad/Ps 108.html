The Lord will have his own people, and he will carry out his own purposes and decrees. They stand fast for ever, so the best thing for us is to do nothing at all. God says that there shall be a harvest; so there is no need for our sowing, and we can lie abed as late as we like.&quot; That is the kind of fatalism that many carry even into their Christianity; they make the eternal purposes and blessed promises of God to become reasons for inaction; but it is not so with any sane child of God.

I think that every young Christian should say when he joins the church, &quot;Now, I do not want to be merely an average Christian. I am nothing, and less than nothing, in myself; but, if there is any blessing to be had from God I will have it. If I can have a closer walk with God than others have, I will have it.

He had seen Shechem, and he knew that it was a place worth possessing; and Gilead, and Manasseh, and all the other places interested him, if they do not interest you. And when a child of God looks over his spiritual treasures, and mentions them one by one, he takes an interest even in the very mention of them. The Bible is a dull book to a person who has no part or lot in it. There is no drier reading, in all the world, than the reading of a will in which one has no interest; but there is nothing that would interest you more than listening to the will of your old uncle, in which he had left you a large fortune. You would lean forward, and you would put your hand to your ear lest you should lose any of it, and you would think that you had never heard a more eloquent discourse than that, and when a man gets to know what &quot;God hath spoken,&quot; what he hath written for him in this blessed Book, which contains his will, every word is music to him, and he is ready to pick out some of the choicest words, and say, &quot;Regeneration is mine; justification is mine; adoption is mine; sanctification is mine; union to Christ is mine; resurrection is mine; eternal life is mine; yea, all things are mine;&quot; and he would dwell upon each one with a holy unction, at least to his own soul.<br/></span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"><img src="Ps%20108_files/image16.png" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span><span class="csA521DC07">Then, if you know what God has given you, </span><span class="csD3860DFD">mind that you use it all.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> What does David say? &quot;Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">As an Oriental, who is weary, throws his sandals to one servant, and then puts his foot out, that another servant may lave it with flowing water, so David says, &quot;I will use Moab and Edom as my servitors.&quot; Now, Christian man, if you have true faith, and mean to do real business with God, and for him, say to yourself, &quot;I have this, and that, and the other blessing, and I am going to use them all for his glory. Then I also have sanctification given me in Christ; so I will use that, and seek to be a true saint, that my life may be a blameless, holy, gracious, Christ-like life. By God&#39;s grace, I will not have even one unused privilege.<br/></span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"><img src="Ps%20108_files/image17.png" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span><span class="csA521DC07"> &quot;God has given me Edom; then I will have it.

I wonder, brothers and sisters, how many of you have any readiness for God in view just now,&mdash;storming some rocky sin, some Petra-like evil in your soul, that seems almost impregnable. You know that your Savior&#39;s name is &quot;Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.&quot; Then, in the strength of that name, go up, and smite your bosom sin, and your constitutional sin; and never rest till you have driven your dagger through every evil that lurks within your soul.<br/></span><span class="cs1B16EEB5"><img src="Ps%20108_files/image18.png" width="30" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span><span class="csA521DC07">Then think what room for readiness you have among your fellowmen. &quot;The earth is the Lord&#39;s, and the fullness thereof;&quot; yet vast multitudes of mankind still sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death. Have any of you initiative enough to go up against the strong cities that are still in rebellion against the Lord Jesus Christ? Can any of you go, and look after those who walk the streets, and seek to bring them to Christ? That would be conquering Edom itself. Have any of you readiness enough to go down into the slums and dens, to seek out the poorest and the vilest of the people? Have you confidence enough to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ can give you that Petra-like city, that dark spot where thieves congregate, where blasphemy is the current language, and where profanity seems even to pollute the very air? Have you &quot;pluck&quot; enough to undertake such an enterprise as that? Is there manliness enough in any one of you to attempt it? Then, having asked the question, &quot;Who will lead me into Edom?&quot; do not forget to pray, &quot;Wilt not thou, O God? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Thou hast spoken; wilt thou not also act, through thy people, so that all flesh may see the salvation of God?&quot; Let each child of God say, &quot;O my Father, I believe that, weak and feeble as I am, my weakness and feebleness need be no hindrance to me if I go to thy service in thy strength! </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&#39;Thou hast spoken in thy holiness; I will rejoice;&#39; and, in thy name, I will conquer the foe, and gather the spoil for thee.&quot; &quot;Through God, we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.&quot; Therefore, if ye believe in God, haste to the spoil of his enemies; quit you like men; be strong! If you really are linked with omnipotence, prove it. Do not just talk about it, but let your deeds show that the Lord of hosts is with you, and that the God of Jacob is your refuge. If, indeed, the Lord&#39;s arm be with you, smite as the Lord would smite. If, indeed, he speaks through you, speak as he would speak. Be strong, and very courageous, and press forward; in the name of God, set up your banners; and who knoweth whether even this feeble message of mine, in rousing you to action upon the basis of confidence in the Word of God, may not cast down some stronghold of the enemy, and make the walls of some mighty Jericho to fall flat to the ground?
