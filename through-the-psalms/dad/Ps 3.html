Bit by bit, </span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">building on each other&#39;s discoveries</span><span class="csA521DC07">, scientists have put together a </span><span class="csF42C4B08">picture of the earth&#39;s crust and core</span><span class="csA521DC07">. In the center is a massive core of iron and nickel. Actually the center comprises two cores: the inner core is solid and extends more than 3,000 miles below the earth&#39;s surface; the outer core is liquid and extends from about 1,800 miles down. Next comes the mantle, which makes up the bulk of the earth&#39;s mass. Part of the upper mantle is somewhat fluid. Then comes the earth&#39;s crust, which is loaded with useful chemicals and is more accessible to investigation and measurement. The crust is composed of light rocks in the continents that are 15 to 55 miles thick, and heavy rocks in the ocean crusts that are 3 to 5 miles thick.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">From time to time the massive forces at work beneath the earth&#39;s crust make their presence felt in the form of earthquakes, landslides, and erupting volcanoes. Earthquakes are notoriously destructive. The magnitude of an earthquake is described by means of the Richter scale (developed by Charles Richter in 1935) which measures the heights of waves recorded on a seismograph. The higher the number, the more destructive the earthquake. On October 17, 1989, for instance, the second most powerful earthquake in United States history devastated the San Francisco area. It measured 7.1 on the Richter scale. Shocks were felt as far away as Sacramento and Los Angeles. Highways buckled, houses and bridges collapsed. Fires broke out. Major damage occurred over a seven-county area.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">About six hundred volcanoes are currently active around the world, and they can be equally destructive. A volcanic explosion tosses rock and clouds of hot gas and dust high in the air. Molten lava pours down the mountain. The heat can melt icecaps and glaciers</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Volcanoes do not occur in a random way. Most are located at plate boundaries, as the famous Ring of Fire around the Pacific ocean illustrates.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The occurrence of an earthquake or the eruption of a volcano bears testimony to <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Pr+3%3A20"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Proverbs 3:20</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">: &quot;By his knowledge the depths are broken up.&quot; These terrible events are a sobering reminder of God&#39;s awesome power and knowledge, and of our feebleness and limitations. We cannot accurately predict a natural disaster. God, on the other hand, knows all the factors that control earthquakes and volcanoes.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The forces that cause dew to form are equally amazing. Suspended in the air above the earth are some 54,460 billion tons of water. The hydraulics involved in lifting such a mass of moisture from the sea to the sky stagger our imaginations. That water is transported and dropped in the form of precipitation. Some of that water is suspended invisibly in what we call humidity. On a still, cloudless night the humidity in the atmosphere silently condenses, forming dew. The drops drench grateful plants and cling like gleaming gems to spiders&#39; webs. This mighty miracle is performed so softly that we do not see it being done. Such is God&#39;s wisdom, power, and gentleness. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Wisdom sees God&#39;s hand in the dew as well as in the earthquake.
