I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">If you are able to sing what you call sacred music, and do things that are not righteous and good before God, then you should question the music that you are using. Part of the blessings of using truly sacred music, is that it will govern our thoughts and keep us from sin. Holy music encourages a wise and perfect walk with God. It inspires the singer to increase their efforts to learn to walk blameless before God in everything that they do.</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">For example, consider these hymns and the message imparted:</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">Can we speak cold, mean spirited things to someone else while singing: <br/>&ldquo;What a Friend we have in Jesus,<br/>All our sins and griefs to bear;<br/>What a privilege to carry<br/>Everything to God in prayer.<br/>O what peace we often forfeit,<br/>O what needless pain we bear,<br/>All because we do not carry<br/>Everything to God in prayer.&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">Can we sit around wasting time and being bitter while singing: <br/>&ldquo;Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,<br/>Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;<br/>Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,<br/>We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves&rdquo;<br/>Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,<br/>We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves;<br/>Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,<br/>We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">Can we sit in a corner, hiding while singing:<br/>&ldquo;Standing on the promises of Christ my King,<br/>Through eternal ages let His praises ring,<br/>Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,<br/>Standing on the promises of God. <br/>Standing, standing, Standing on the promises of God my Savior;<br/>Standing, standing, I&rsquo;m standing on the promises of God&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">Can we lay around letting guilt and sin capture us while singing:<br/>&ldquo;I heard an old, old story,<br/>How a Savior came from glory,<br/>How He gave His life on Calvary<br/>To save a wretch like me;<br/>I heard about His groaning,<br/>Of His precious blood&#39;s atoning,<br/>Then I repented of my sins<br/>And won the victory. <br/>O victory in Jesus,<br/>My Savior, forever.<br/>He sought me and bought me<br/>With His redeeming blood;<br/>He loved me ere I knew Him<br/>And all my love is due Him,<br/>He plunged me to victory,<br/>Beneath the cleansing flood&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">Can we skip saying Grace for our meals, or daily prayers while singing: <br/>&ldquo;Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br/>That calls me from a world of care,<br/>And bids me at my Father&rsquo;s throne<br/>Make all my wants and wishes known.<br/>In seasons of distress and grief,<br/>My soul has often found relief,<br/>And oft escaped the tempter&rsquo;s snare,<br/>By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">Can we sleep in late and ignore God while singing:<br/>&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy!

Merciful and mighty,<br/>God in three Persons, blessed Trinity&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="cs821257DA">B</span><span class="csC05134DD">efore we can worship God correctly through the great hymns and spiritual songs, we must commit ourselves to learning to be holy in all things.

I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">There are times in our lives when our singing immediately stops. These are times when we are beholding things that are evil, and not right, or when things suddenly surprise us. If we are going to be able to sing, and sing continuously, we must learn to avoid looking upon those things that are evil. We must avoid spending time with those people who fall away from doing what is right and influence us to do wrong.</span></p><h1 class="cs3B115D75">

Singing holy songs lifts not only the heart and soul to God, but it closes the opportunity for what is evil to permeate and overtake us.</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">This kind of singing will automatically filter away worthless friends. It is amazing how many people hate holy music, and will do everything they can to avoid it.</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">Our singing not only testifies of whom we serve, but it also can quickly save and shield us from those that we may have fallen as prey. Those who were sold out to wickedness cannot tolerate right, nor can they stand to be near someone who does what is holy. </span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">singing the songs of God can form a protective shield about you from which a great deal of harm can be repulsed before it can come near.</span></p><h1 class="cs3B115D75">

There is a great deal of slander that goes on in society. The slander keeps us from praising God and honoring Him as we should. To listen to it, we must stop singing. To share it we must stop singing. The problem is when we cannot praise God with our lips, we are bringing shame to God and sin into our own lives.</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">Something should be said about slander. There is a factual recounting of events that is very right and proper to do. We are obligated to warn others of dangers that lurk. However, there is a fine line between warning people all the time, from a heart of superiority, and a humble warning to actually save a person from harm. Slander is the speaking of lies about another person in a hushed and hurtful way.</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">A second thing that singing does is prohibit pride. Singing humbly before God does not leave room for vain glory. It is a very humbling thing to go about declaring who you are and whom you serve. It also has no time or place for responding to the proud look or the evil glance.</span></p><h1 class="cs3B115D75">

As people here singing praises to God, they recognize the tunes and hear the words, and it cannot help but bring them together in fellowship, if they are spiritually awake. It enables us to be able to keep an eye out for those who are also devout servants of God and to be able to help encourage them in their walk along the way.</span></p><p class="cs33DA4936"><span class="csC05134DD">Philippians 2:4-7 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
