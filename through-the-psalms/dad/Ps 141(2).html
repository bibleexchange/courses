That he might be preserved from a liking of, or a longing after those things, which are the baits and allurements whereby men are apt to be drawn into societies and conspiracies with the workers of iniquity; &quot;And let me not eat of their dainties.&quot; See Pr 1:10-14. For he here describeth the condition of men prospering for a season in a course of wickedness; they first jointly give up themselves unto the practice of iniquity, and then together solace themselves in those satisfactions of their lusts, with which their power and interest in the world do furnish them. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">The &quot;dainties&quot; are evil desires, longing and strong desires betray the minds of unstable persons unto a compliance with ways of sin and folly: for I look on these &quot;dainties&quot; as including whatever the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, or the pride of life may desire. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">David prays deliver me from any inclination of evil; the allurements of a course of sin.
