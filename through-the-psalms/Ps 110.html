Aaron and his seed came and went; their imperfect sacrifice continued for many generations, because it had no finality in it, and could never make the comers thereunto perfect.

And indeed there are very few, if any, of the articles of that creed which we all generally profess, which are not either plainly expressed, or by most evident implication couched in this little model. First, the Doctrine of the Trinity is in the first words; &quot;The Lord said unto my Lord.&quot; There is Jehovah the Father, and my Lord, the Son, and the consecrating of him to be David&#39;s Lord which was by the Holy Ghost, by whose fulness he was anointed unto the offices of king and priest; for so our Saviour himself expounds this word &quot;said, &quot;by the scaling and sanctification of him to his office, Joh 10:34,35,36. Then we have the Incarnation of Christ, in the words, &quot;my Lord, &quot;together with his dignity and honour above David (as our Saviour himself expounds it, Mt 22:42,45). Mine, that is, my Son by descent and genealogy after the flesh, and yet my Lord too, in regard of his higher son ship. We have also the Sufferings of Christ, in that he was consecrated a priest (Ps 110:4) to offer up himself once for all, and so to drink of the brook in the way. We have his Completed Work and conquest over all his enemies and sufferings; his Resurrection, &quot;he shalt lift up his head&quot;; his Ascension and Intercession, &quot;Sit thou on my right hand.&quot; We have here also a Holy Catholic Church gathered together by the sceptre of his kingdom, and holding in the parts thereof a blessed and beautiful Communion of Saints; &quot;The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.&quot;. We have the Last Judgment, for all his enemies must be put under his feet, (which is the Apostle&#39;s argument to prove the end of all things, 1Co 15:25); and there is the day of his wrath, wherein he shall accomplish that judgment over the heathen, and that victory over the kings of the earth (who take counsel and band themselves together against him), which he doth here in his word begin. We have the Remission of sins, comprised in his priesthood, for he was to offer sacrifices for the remission of sins, and &quot;to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, &quot;Eph 1:7 Heb 9:26. We have the Resurrection of the body, because he must &quot;subdue all enemies under his feet, and the last enemy to be destroyed is death, &quot;as the Apostle argues out of this psalm, 1Co 15:25,26. And lastly, we have life everlasting, in the everlasting merit and virtue of his priesthood, &quot;Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek, &quot;and in his sitting at the right hand of God, whither he is gone as our forerunner, and to prepare a place for us, Heb 6:20 Joh 14:2; and therefore the apostle from his sitting there, and living ever, infers the perfection and certainty of our salvation, Ro 6:8,11 8:17 Eph 2:16 Col 3:1-4 1Co 15:49; Php 3:20,21 1Th 4:14 Heb 7:25 1Jo 3:2. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Verse 1.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> In this one verse we have a description of Christ&#39;s person, his wars and his victory; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Verse 1.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">My Lord.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> From hence we learn that though Christ was man, yet he was more than a bare man, since he is Lord to his father David. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs75A07D5F">Verse 1.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span><span class="csD3860DFD">My Lord.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> It was a higher honour to have Christ for his son, than to be a king; yet David does not say that Christ is his son, but rejoices that Christ is his Lord, and he Christ&#39;s servant.
