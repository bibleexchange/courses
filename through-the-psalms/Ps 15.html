Only those who seek God WITH ALL THEIR HEART find Him (Jeremiah 29:13). God rewards only those who DILIGENTLY seek Him (Heb.11:6 - KJV). Why is this so? Because it is only when we seek God WHOLEHEARTEDLY that we prove that our relationship with Him is the MOST IMPORTANT thing to us in the world. </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AS WE SHOULD, WITHOUT BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SERVE THE LORD AS WE SHOULD, WITHOUT BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">Even Jesus Himself needed to be anointed with the Holy Spirit, before He went out into His ministry (Luke 3:21-23). </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">The Lord told His disciples to WAIT until they &quot;were clothed with power from on high&quot; (Luke 24:49). While the world lay dying in need of hearing the gospel, those apostles needed to wait until they were baptized in the Holy Spirit before they could go out and serve the Lord (Acts 1:8). </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">What about us?? </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">How foolish we are to think that we don&#39;t need this too!! </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">On the day of Pentecost, Peter told the people that God was offering TWO gifts to all who would repent, believe and be baptized - FORGIVENESS OF SINS and THE HOLY SPIRIT (Read Acts 2:38). </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">Forgiveness of sins qualifies us for heaven. </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">The baptism in the Spirit fits us for life on earth. </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">If you are only interested in going to heaven when you die, you don&#39;t need to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. You only need to have your sins forgiven. But if you want to spend your earthly days usefully, showing your gratitude to the Lord for dying for you, by serving Him, then you MUST be filled with the Holy Spirit. </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">There are FIVE main reasons why many believers are NOT baptized in the Holy Spirit: </span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs50909F0">&middot; &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(1) They have been INTELLECTUALLY CONVINCED by some theological argument that they were baptized in the Spirit when they were born again. And even though they are defeated, powerless, empty and fruitless, they continue to believe this theological deception. </span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs50909F0">&middot; &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(2) They feel that they are NOT WORTHY ENOUGH to receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The fact of the matter is that the more unworthy you feel and the greater the sinner you consider yourself to be, the more fit you are to receive the Holy Spirit - because God&#39;s gifts are given only to those who feel themselves most unworthy to receive them. If you have repented of your sins, it doesn&#39;t matter how unworthy or unfit or useless you are. Hallelujah! </span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs50909F0">&middot; &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(3) They DON&#39;T BELIEVE that God is a good God - who gives His gifts freely to all who ask Him. They feel that they have to pay a price - do some good deeds, like fasting and praying, before they can receive. But God&#39;s gifts are all freely given - whether it be the forgiveness of sins or the baptism in the Spirit. None of God&#39;s gifts can be purchased. Many believers feel that to have faith itself, is a difficult thing. But Jesus likened faith to drinking (See John 7:37,38, &quot;...DRINK.... BELIEVE&quot;). To receive the Holy Spirit is as easy as drinking. Even babies know how to drink - and those who are newly born again can be baptized with the Holy Spirit. That is how it was in the early days - as we read in the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot;. </span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="cs50909F0">&middot; &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(4) They DON&#39;T THIRST. They are not desperate enough. Jesus spoke a parable of a man who kept on knocking at his neighbour&#39;s door, UNTIL HE RECEIVED what he wanted. Then Jesus went on to say that our Heavenly Father would also give the Holy Spirit to those who asked, sought and knocked like that man (Read Luke 11:13 in the context of the previous verses, beginning at v.5). </span></p><p class="csACEA4482"><span class="cs50909F0">&middot; &nbsp;</span><span class="cs15323895">(5) They WAIT FOR SOME EXPERIENCE (tongues or thrills etc., ) similar to the one they heard someone else testify to. They are not willing to leave it to God to decide what gift or manifestation is best for them to have. The Holy Spirit is received by simple faith. Ask and ye shall receive (Gal.3:2; Luke 11:9-13). Don&#39;t wait for feelings. But ask God to give you an assurance. Leave it to Him as to how He gives you that assurance. Didn&#39;t He give you an assurance that your sins are forgiven and that you are His child? In the same way, He can also assure you that He has filled you with the Holy Spirit. What you need is not an experience, but POWER (Acts 1:8). </span></p><p class="csC45CCED"><span class="cs15323895">SO: THIRST - BELIEVE - AND RECEIVE. Now is the accepted time.

But I found a great lack of </span><span class="csC382D2BB">power</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in my ministry. In the church I attended, we studied the Bible, but it was like studying a history book &ndash; all intellectual! The messages I heard in the church-meetings too were heavy and boring, lacking the freshness and fire of the Holy Spirit.</span></p><p class="csA80D71DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus told the Sadducees once that they did not know the Scriptures or the power of God </span><span class="csC382D2BB">(Mt.22:29).</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> In my case, I knew the Scriptures - to some extent - but I certainly did not know the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">power</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of God. Jesus told His disciples that they would receive power only when they were baptized in the Holy Spirit (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Acts 1:5, 8)</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. But I discovered that different Christian churches taught differently on this subject. Some taught that every born-again Christian was automatically baptized in the Spirit at new birth whether he realized it or not. Others taught that one had to seek the Lord specifically for the baptism in the Spirit </span><span class="csC382D2BB">after</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> being born again. I was confused. But I saw that Jesus Himself was anointed with the Spirit before He began His ministry </span><span class="csC382D2BB">(Acts 10:38).</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Then how much more I needed this! Jesus also said that </span><span class="csC382D2BB">everyone</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> who believed in Him could have rivers of living water flowing out from him. But I found only a trickle flowing out from me. I realized that I was missing something. And so I decided to seek God for His power, without getting bogged down in a theological argument about the Holy Spirit. I wanted the rivers.</span></p><p class="csA80D71DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I visited a group of assemblies that emphasized the ministry of the Holy Spirit, to see if they could help me. They were very zealous, but I was disappointed with much that I saw in their midst. There was a lot of noise and emotionalism, but hardly any emphasis on victory over sin or Christlikeness of character (which is what the Holy Spirit came to give us primarily). Many of their pastors also seemed to be great lovers of money! One pastor asked me to keep on repeating the word &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; if I wanted to be baptized in the Spirit! I refused to do that, since I knew that that was not the way the apostles received the baptism in the Spirit. All this was certainly not the fulness of the Spirit that I was looking for. But the counterfeit only proved to me that the genuine article must be valuable - for people make counterfeits only of valuable articles! I told God that I did NOT want what I saw in those groups, but I did want the genuine baptism in the Holy Spirit that the apostles received on the day of Pentecost. And I cried out to God every day for that.</span></p><p class="csA80D71DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I saw from the Scriptures that Jesus was anointed with the Spirit when He chose to be baptized in water - which symbolized His choosing the way of death to the Self-life. The Lord showed me then that the Spirit-filled life was closely connected with the way of the cross. He told me that if I chose the way of the cross at all times, I would have His power upon me always too.</span></p><p class="csA80D71DE"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God filled me with His Spirit at that time. There was no physical manifestation. But I found a freshness, a liberty and a boldness in my ministry thereafter. I began to experience the gift of prophesying - to edify and encourage and challenge others </span><span class="csC382D2BB">(1 Cor.14:3).</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> I loved Jesus more fervently and I longed to serve Him wholeheartedly. The way of the cross became precious to me. And I had a burning passion to bring others to Christ. I did not speak in tongues at that time. That came 11 years later.</span></p><p class="cs80D9435B"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What I experienced then was only a beginning. Since then I have had to be filled with the Spirit again and again and again. (We read in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Acts</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of three times when Peter was filled with the Spirit.) A cup, a well and a river can all be full.
