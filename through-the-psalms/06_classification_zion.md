6. **Psalms of Zion** extol Zion, or Jerusalem, for its exalted role as the abode of Godâ€™s glory and as the religious and political capital of the nation (Chapters 15, 24, 46, 48, 50, 76, 81, 84, 87, 95, 122, 134). The Pilgrim Psalms (see below), are sometimes included here, but they do not really constitute a distinct literary type.
