Not only in the wilderness with manna, but everywhere else by his providence he has supplied the necessities of his believing people. Somewhere or other they have had food convenient for them, and that in times of great scarcity. As for spiritual meat, that has been plentifully furnished them in Christ Jesus; they have been fed with the finest of the wheat, and made to feast on royal dainties. His word is as nourishing to the soul as bread to the body, and there is such an abundance of it that no heir of heaven shall ever be famished. Truly the fear of the Lord is wisdom, since it secures to a man the supply of all that he needs for soul and body. He will ever be mindful of his covenant. He could not let his people lack meat because he was in covenant with them, and they can never want in the future, for he will continue to act upon the terms of that covenant. No promise of the Lord shall fall to the ground, nor will any part of the great compact of eternal love be revoked or allowed to sink into oblivion. The covenant of grace is the plan of the great work which the Lord works out for his people, and it will never be departed from: the Lord has set his hand and seal to it, his glory and honour are involved in it, yea, his very name hangs upon it, and he will not even in the least jot or tittle cease to be mindful of it. Of this the feeding of his people is the pledge: he would not so continually supply their needs if he meant after all to destroy them. Upon this most blessed earnest let us settle our minds; let us rest in the faithfulness of the Lord, and praise him with all our hearts every time that we eat bread or feed upon his word. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Verse 6.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">He hath shewed his people the power of his works.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> They have seen what he is able to do and what force he is prepared to put forth on their behalf. This power Israel saw in physical works, and we in spiritual wonders, for we behold the matchless energy of the Holy Ghost and feel it in our own souls. In times of dire distress the Lord has put forth such energy of grace that we have been astonished at his power; and this was part of his intent in bringing us into such conditions that he might reveal to us the arm of his strength. Could we ever have known it so well if we had not been in pressing need of his help? We may well turn this verse into a prayer and ask to see more and more the power of the Lord at work among us in these latter days. O Lord, let us now see how mightily thou canst work in the saving of sinners and in preserving and delivering thine own people. That he may give them the heritage of the heathen. He put forth all his power to drive out the Canaanites and bring in his people. Even thus may it please his infinite wisdom to give to his church the heathen for her inheritance in the name of Jesus. Nothing but great power can effect this, but it will surely be accomplished in due season. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Verse 7.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">The works of his hands are verity and judgment.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> Truth and justice are conspicuous in all that Jehovah does. Nothing like artifice or crooked policy can ever be seen in his proceedings; he acts faithfully and righteously towards his people, and with justice and impartiality to all mankind. This also should lead us to praise him, since it is of the utmost advantage to us to live under a sovereign whose laws, decrees, acts, and deeds are the essence of truth and justice. All his commandments are sure. All that he has appointed or decreed shall surely stand, and his precepts which he has proclaimed shall be found worthy of our obedience, for surely they are founded in justice and are meant for our lasting good. He is no fickle despot, commanding one thing one day and another another, but his commands remain absolutely unaltered, their necessity equally unquestionable, their excellence permanently proven, and their reward eternally secure. Take the word commandments to relate either to his decrees or his precepts, and we have in each case an important sense; but it seems more in accordance with the connection to take the first sense and consider the words to refer to the ordinances, appointments, or decrees of the great King. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csEF2D250D">Whatever the mighty Lord decrees,<br/>Shall stand for ever sure.<br/>The settled purpose of his heart<br/>To ages shall endure. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Verse 8.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">They stand fast for ever and ever.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> That is to say, his purposes, commands, and courses of action. The Lord is not swayed by transient motives, or moved by the circumstances of the hour; immutable principles rule in the courts of Jehovah, and he pursues his eternal purposes without the shadow of a turning. Our works are too often as wood, hay, and stubble, but his doings are as gold, silver, and precious stones. We take up a purpose for a while and then exchange it for another, but he is of one mind, and none can turn him: he acts in eternity and for eternity, and hence what he works abides for ever. Much of this lasting character arises out of the fact which is next mentioned, namely, that they are done in truth and uprightness. Nothing stands but that which is upright. Falsehood soon vanishes, for it is a mere show, but truth has salt in it which preserves it from decay. God always acts according to the glorious principles of truth and integrity, and hence there is no need of alteration or revocation; his works will endure till the end of time. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Verse 9.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">He sent redemption unto his people.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> When they were in Egypt he sent not only a deliverer, but an actual deliverance; not only a redeemer, but complete redemption. He has done the like spiritually for all his people, having first by blood purchased them out of the hand of the enemy, and then by power rescued them from the bondage of their sins. Redemption we can sing of as an accomplished act: it has been wrought for us, sent to us, and enjoyed by us, and we are in very deed the Lord&#39;s redeemed. He hath commanded his covenant for ever. His divine decree has made the covenant of his grace a settled and eternal institution: redemption by blood proves that the covenant cannot be altered, for it ratifies and establishes it beyond all recall. This, too, is reason for the loudest praise. Redemption is a fit theme for the heartiest music, and when it is seen to be connected with gracious engagements from which the Lord&#39;s truth cannot swerve, it becomes a subject fitted to arouse the soul to an ecstasy of gratitude. Redemption and the covenant are enough to make the tongue of the dumb sing. Holy and reverend is his name. Well may he say this. The whole name or character of God is worthy of profoundest awe, for it is perfect and complete, whole or holy. It ought not to be spoken without solemn thought, and never heard without profound homage. His name is to be trembled at, it is something terrible; even those who know him best rejoice with trembling before him. How good men can endure to be called &quot;reverend&quot; we know not. Being unable to discover any reason why our fellow men should reverence </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">us</span><span class="csEF2D250D">, we half suspect that in other men there is not very much which can entitle them to be called reverend, very reverend, right reverend, and so on. It may seem a trifling matter, but for that very reason we would urge that the foolish custom should be allowed to fall into disuse. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Verse 10.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> It is its first principle, but it is also its head and chief attainment. The word &quot;beginning&quot; in Scripture sometimes means the chief; and true religion is at once the first element of wisdom, and its chief fruit. To know God so as to walk aright before him is the greatest of all the applied sciences. Holy reverence of God leads us to praise him, and this is the point which the psalm drives at, for it is a wise act on the part of a creature towards his Creator. A good understanding have all they that do his commandments. Obedience to God proves that our judgment is sound. Why should he not be obeyed? Does not reason itself claim obedience for the Lord of all? Only a man void of understanding will ever justify rebellion against the holy God. Practical godliness is the test of wisdom. Men may know and be very orthodox, they may talk and be very eloquent, they may speculate and be very profound; but the best proof of their intelligence must be found in their actually doing the will of the Lord. The former part of the psalm taught us the doctrine of God&#39;s nature and character, by describing his works: the second part supplies the practical lesson by drawing the inference that to worship and obey him is the dictate of true wisdom. We joyfully own that it is so. His praise endureth for ever. The praises of God will never cease, because his works will always excite adoration, and it will always be the wisdom of men to extol their glorious Lord. Some regard this sentence as referring to those who fear the Lord&mdash;their praise shall endure for ever: and, indeed, it is true that those who lead obedient lives shall obtain honour of the Lord, and commendations which will abide for ever. A word of approbation from the mouth of God will be a mede of honour which will outshine all the decorations which kings and emperors can bestow. Lord, help us to study thy works, and henceforth to breathe out hallelujahs as long as we live. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csEF2D250D">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><a name="expl"><span class="csEF2D250D">EXPLANATORY NOTES AND QUAINT SAYINGS</span></a></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Whole Psalm.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> This is the first alphabetical psalm which is regular throughout.

They are connected in this way: Psalm 111 sets forth the greatness, mercy, and righteousness of God: Psalm 112 the reflection of these attributes in the greatness, Ps 112:2, mercy, Ps 112:5, and righteousness, Ps 112:4,9, of his chosen. The correspondence of purpose in the two psalms is important to the right appreciation of some difficulties connected with the latter psalm.&mdash;</span><span class="cs6EAD8497">Speaker&#39;s Commentary.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Whole Psalm.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> The scope of this Psalm is to stir up all to praise God, and that for so many reasons as there are verses in the psalm. The exhortation is in the first words, </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">&quot;Praise ye the Lord.&quot;</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> The reasons follow in order. The psalm is composed so after the order of the Hebrew alphabet, as every sentence or half verse begins with a several letter of the A B C in order, and all the psalm is of praise only. Whence we learn in general, </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csEF2D250D">1. Sometimes it is expedient to set all other things apart, and employ ourselves expressly to proclaim the praises of the Lord only; for so is done in this psalm. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csEF2D250D">2. The praises of the Lord are able to fill all the letters and words composed of letters, in all their possible junctures of composition; for so much doth the going through all the letters of the A B C point out unto us, he is Alpha and Omega, and all the middle letters of the A B C of praise. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csEF2D250D">3. The praises of the Lord are worthy to be kept in memory: for that this psalm may be the better remembered, it is composed after the manner of the A B C, and so it insinuated thus much to us.&mdash;</span><span class="cs6EAD8497">David Dickson.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Verse 1.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">Praise ye the LORD</span><span class="csEF2D250D">, etc. The exhortation is immediately succeeded by the expression of a firm resolve; the psalmist having commenced by urging the duty of gratitude upon others&mdash;</span><span class="cs6EAD8497">&quot;Praise ye</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">the LORD, &quot;</span><span class="csEF2D250D">forthwith announces his determination to act upon his own advice&mdash;</span><span class="cs6EAD8497">&quot;I will praise the LORD with my whole heart.&quot;</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> Such a conjunction of ideas is fraught with several most important lessons. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csEF2D250D">1. It teaches us, very emphatically, that our preaching, if it is to carry weight and conviction, must be backed and exemplified by our conduct; that we need never expect to persuade others by arguments which are too weak to influence ourselves. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csEF2D250D">2. Another inference is similarly suggested&mdash;that our own decision should be given without reference to the result of our appeal. The psalmist did not wait to ascertain whether those whom he addressed would attend to his exhortation, but, before he could receive a reply, declared unhesitatingly the course he would himself adopt.&mdash;</span><span class="cs6EAD8497">W.T.

Men are ever attempting to unite what the word of God has declared to be incapable of union&mdash;the love of the world and of God&mdash;to give half their heart to the world, and the other half to God. Just see the energy, the entireness of every thought and feeling and effort which a man throws into a work in which he is deeply interested; the very phrase we use to describe such an one is, that &quot;he gives his whole mind to it.&quot; Attempt to persuade him to divert his energies and divide his time with some other pursuit, and he would wonder at the folly and the ignorance that could suggest such a method of success. &quot;Just take a hint from Satan, &quot;says some one; &quot;see how he plies his powers on the individual, as if there were but that one, and as if he had nothing else to do but to ruin that one soul.&quot; It was a holy resolution of the Psalmist that he would praise God; and a wise one to add, </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">&quot;with thy whole heart.&quot;</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> And we have the result of this determination in the following verses of the psalm.&mdash;</span><span class="cs6EAD8497">Barton Bouchier.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs16E84F30">Verse 1.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> Two words are used, </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">assembly</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> and </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">congregation.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> The former implies a more private meeting of worshippers, the latter the more public.

It leads me to the inference, that from the contemplation of the great works of creation, God&#39;s makings, wonderful, and interesting, and useful as they are, the spiritual mind of God&#39;s servant rapidly passes to some greater deed which the Lord hath done, some more marvellous act which he has accomplished, and which he designates as an honourable and a glorious deed. Now, since I consider that he spoke before of Christ, as the visible and immediate agent in creation, without whom was not anything made that was made, can we hesitate long as to this greater work, the rather as to it is immediately subjoined the suggestive sentence, </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">And his</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> </span><span class="cs6EAD8497">righteousness endureth for ever.</span><span class="csEF2D250D"> Is not this doing, the making an end of sin, and the bringing in of an everlasting righteousness?

Has it no Aristotle, no Socrates, no Tacitus, no Goethe, no Gibbon? Let us understand what wisdom is. It is not any mere amount of knowledge that constitutes wisdom. Appropriate knowledge is essential to wisdom. A man who has not the knowledge appropriate to his position, who does not know himself in his relation to God and to his fellowmen, who is misinformed as to his duties, his dangers, his necessities, though he may have written innumerable works of a most exalted character, yet is he to be set down as a man without wisdom. What is it to you that your servant is acquainted with mathematics, if he is ignorant of your will, and of the way to do it? The genius of a Voltaire, a Spinoza, a Byron, only makes their folly the more striking. As though a man floating rapidly onwards to the falls of Niagara, should occupy himself in drawing a very admirable picture of the scenery. Men who are exceedingly great in the world&#39;s estimation have made the most signal blunders with regard to the most important things; and it is only because these things are not considered important by the world, that the reputation of these men remains. If you have learned to estimate things in some measure as God estimates them, to desire what he offers, to relinquish what he forbids, and to recognize the duties that he has appointed you, you are in the path of wisdom, and the great men we have been speaking about are far behind you&mdash;far from the narrow gate which you have entered.
