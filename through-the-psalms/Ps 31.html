She was healthy and happy, and completely unspoiled and devoted to her beloved. While the harem-types tended to be sickly and sulky, she was bursting with vigor and good spirits. The best the harem wives could manage was a sly smile, a spiteful sneer, or a lustful leer. The young Shulamite&#39;s laughter rang out across the meadow.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">As Solomon concluded his comments about how rich the model woman is, he indicated </span><span class="csD3860DFD">how she increases her means:</span><span class="csA521DC07"> &quot;She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff (Proverbs 31:18-19).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">She was running quite a business from her house. Her spinning wheel was always at work, late into the night. If she was not spinning thread, she was carding wool. If she was not carding wool, she was weaving cloth. Her husband was a second Jacob, well known for his skill in multiplying sheep, and her wares were famous for their quality, quantity, and noble prices. Solomon&#39;s buyers were old hands at negotiating lower prices, but she knew the value of her merchandise. It was fit for a king&#39;s palace, where some of it no doubt found its way.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt left 346.5pt;">
			<span class="cs75A07D5F">5. The Model Woman: How Responsive She Is (31:20)</span></h4>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">But the virtuous woman he wrote about was not greedy. Shrewd and thrifty though she was, and keen as her eye was to business, her heart went out to the poor. She was a Dorcas in Israel long before there was a Dorcas in the church (Acts 9:36-42). There wasn&#39;t a poor person or needy family in all that part of the country that did not have ample reason to bless her hard-working hands.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt left 346.5pt;">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.&quot; The original Hebrew wording suggests that the woman Solomon was describing provided a double change of raiment.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt left 346.5pt;">
			<span class="cs75A07D5F">7. The Model Woman: How Respected She Is (31:22-25)</span></h4>
		<h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt left 346.5pt;">
			<span class="cs987D718D">a. Her Personal Appearance (31:22)</span></h5>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.&quot; Solomon had seen his ideal woman in the village. Not even the pharaoh&#39;s daughter, his pampered and privileged queen who was raised in the lap of luxury, was better dressed than the Shulamite. The queen might send to Egypt for her linens and to India for her silks. Her embroidered robes and imperial purple coats might come from the Phoenician emporium. But Solomon&#39;s wife&mdash;in all her glory&mdash;was not arrayed more royally than the virtuous woman who so captivated the king. She had come up in the world and her attire befitted her station. Her devoted husband liked her to dress well. She had earned the right to wear silk and purple. She was a queen in her own right.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">Solomon could only sigh. When he first met the Shulamite, she was dressed in humble peasant garb. He offered to clothe her in garments laced with silver and gold (Song of Solomon 1:10-11), but she turned her back on him. Now she was more of a queen than the pharaoh&#39;s daughter would ever be. The ideal woman wore her fine clothes with grace and gladness.</span></p><h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt left 346.5pt;">
			<span class="cs987D718D">b. Her Public Applause (31:23)</span></h5>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">&quot;Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">He was &quot;known&quot; in the places where decisions were made. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">he was &quot;known&quot; because of his knowledge. His knowledge had earned him the respect of everyone at the city gate, which was the courtroom of his day. High and low, rich and poor, peasant and peer alike acknowledged him. In his own right, he was as great as a king.</span></p><h5 class="csA2081E9A" style="tab-stops:left 72pt left 346.5pt;">
			<span class="cs987D718D">c. Her Popular Approval (31:24-25)</span></h5>
		<p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">The virtuous woman has </span><span class="csD3860DFD">no trouble selling her merchandise:</span><span class="csA521DC07"> &quot;She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant&quot; (Proverbs 31:24).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">The Shulamite&#39;s workmanship, &nbsp;famous??? </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">The model woman is prepared for today and tomorrow, she has </span><span class="csD3860DFD">no trouble settling her mind:</span><span class="csA521DC07"> &quot;Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come&quot; (Proverbs 31:25).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">success did not go to her head. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">She was protected by her character and convictions.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt left 346.5pt;">

		<p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">She is right </span><span class="csD3860DFD">in what </span><span class="cs74CC927A">she says</span><span class="csD3860DFD">:</span><span class="csA521DC07"> &quot;She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness&quot; (Proverbs 31:26). The word rendered &quot;wisdom&quot; here is </span><span class="csD3860DFD">chokmah</span><span class="csA521DC07">, the same word Solomon used the first time he mentioned wisdom in the book of Proverbs (1:2). The last mention is in 31:26. The whole book had been one long search for wisdom, and there it was staring him in the face all the time, personalized in a virtuous woman.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">Solomon helped our understanding by personifying wisdom as a woman, but what was really needed was for wisdom to be incarnated in flesh and blood. Some hoped that Solomon himself might do just that. But then he married a pagan Egyptian, made her his queen, and started on a path that ended in complete folly. It would be nearly another thousand years before wisdom would be fully displayed in a man. That man was Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">Proverbs 31:26 says of the model woman that &quot;in her tongue is the law of kindness.&quot; She does not indulge in gossip, slander, or falsehoods. Even if a thought is true, if it isn&#39;t kind, she holds her tongue. She tries to say a compassionate or kind word for everyone. And being right in what she says makes her to pursue perfection (James 3:2).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2" style="tab-stops:left 346.5pt;"><span class="csA521DC07">The model woman is &nbsp;right </span><span class="csD3860DFD">in what </span><span class="cs74CC927A">she sees</span><span class="csD3860DFD">:</span><span class="csA521DC07"> &quot;She looketh well to the ways of her household [she oversees each servant], and eateth not the bread of idleness [she oversees each second]&quot; (Proverbs 31:27). she has learned the principles of good management and practices them. She keeps a tight control over employees and time. She is kind, compassionate, and considerate of others, but she is not &quot;a soft touch.&quot; She does not reward idle behavior in others any more than she tolerates it in herself.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt left 346.5pt;">
