Plumer, D.D., L.L.D., 1867.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The &quot;rod&quot; has a variety of meanings in Scripture. It might be of different materials, as it was employed for different purposes. At an early period, a wooden rod came into use as one of the insignia of royalty, under the name of sceptre. By degrees the sceptre grew in importance, and was regarded as characteristic of an empire, or of the reign of some particular king. A golden sceptre denoted wealth and pomp. The right, or straight sceptre, of which we read in <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ps+45%3A6"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Psalm 45:6</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">, is expressive of the justice and uprightness, the truth and equity, which shall distinguish Messiah&#39;s reign, after his kingdom on earth has been established. But when it is said in <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Rev+19%3A15"><span class="cs35BB5DCF">Revelation 19:15</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">, that he, &quot;whose name is called the Word of God,&quot; will smite the nations, and &quot;rule them with a rod of iron,&quot; if the rod signifies &quot;his sceptre,&quot; then the &quot;iron&quot; of which it is made must be designed to express the severity of the judgments which the omnipotent &quot;King of kings&quot; will inflict on all who resist his authority. But to me it appears doubtful whether the &quot;rod of iron&quot; symbolises the royal sceptre of the Son of God at his second advent. It is mentioned in connection with &quot;a sharp sword,&quot; which leads me to prefer the opinion that it also ought to be regarded as a weapon of war; at all events, the &quot;rod of iron&quot; mentioned in the Psalm we are endeavouring to explain. is evidently not the emblem of sovereign power, although represented as in the hands of a king, but an instrument of correction and punishment. In this sense the word &quot;rod&quot; is often used&hellip; When the correcting rod, which usually was a wand or cane, is represented as in this second Psalm, to be of &quot;iron,&quot; it only indicates how weighty, how severe, how effectual the threatened chastisement will be&mdash;it will not merely bruise, but it will break. &quot;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Now it is just such a complete breaking as would not readily be effected excepting by an iron rod, that is more fully expressed in the following clause of the verse, &quot;Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter&#39;s vessel.&quot; The completeness of the destruction, however, depends on two things. Even an iron rod, if gently used, or used against a hard and firm substance, might cause little injury; but, in the case before us, it is supposed to be applied with great force, &quot;Thou shalt dash them;&quot; and it is applied to what will prove as brittle and frangible as &quot;a potter&#39;s vessel&quot;&mdash;&quot;Thou shalt dash them in pieces.&quot;&hellip; Here, as in other respects, we must feel that the predictions and promises of this Psalm were but very partially fulfilled in the history of the literal David. Their real accomplishment, their awful completion, abides the day when the spiritual David shall come in glory and in majesty as Zion&#39;s King, with a rod of iron to dash in pieces the great antichristian confederacy of kings and peoples, and to take possession of his long-promised and dearly-purchased inheritance. And the signs of the times seem to indicate that the coming of the Lord draws nigh.&mdash;David Pitcairn.</span></p><h4 class="cs550128D4" style="tab-stops:left 54pt;">

It has served its purpose and has been shaken to its very foundation. It will be revived, of course, during the Millennium, but even the millennial age will be temporary and its kingdom transient. In contrast to that, believers have a place in God&#39;s ultimate kingdom, a kingdom that cannot be shaken at all. The relation of the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">eternal</span><span class="csA521DC07"> kingdom to the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">millennial</span><span class="csA521DC07"> kingdom is symbolized in Revelation by the relation of </span><span class="csD3860DFD">the New Jerusalem</span><span class="csA521DC07"> to the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">earthly Jerusalem.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> The heavenly Jerusalem hovers in space over the earthly Jerusalem. The one is heavenly, but the other earthly; the one eternal, the other destined to be burned up at the end of the Millennium. Believers, in the heavenly Jerusalem, will &quot;reign with Christ&quot; and have jurisdiction over the earth during the Millennium; their place and privilege is determined by their faithfulness on earth in this life. We should be moved by this glorious fact.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Moreover, we should be </span><span class="csD3860DFD">moved by God&#39;s gracious favor.</span><span class="csA521DC07"> &quot;Let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Out of a deep sense of the favor bestowed upon us by God, we should give Him back joyful service.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Far from sitting on the fence, as many of the Hebrews were doing, we should be flinging ourselves wholeheartedly into God&#39;s work, moved not only by God&#39;s gracious favor but </span><span class="csD3860DFD">moved by a godly fear</span><span class="csA521DC07"> as well. We should serve &quot;with reverence and godly fear: for our God is a consuming fire&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Grace gives us no license to forget God&#39;s holiness. He is our Father, but He is also a consuming fire. In the Old Testament, God put distance between the sacred Ark of the Covenant and the rank and file of the people even when the camp was on the march. The distance has now been removed, but the burning holiness remains.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Thus ends the last warning in the book. For a Hebrew believer to go back to Judaism in the light of all that has been said would simply prove that he is an apostate and not a regenerate person at all.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/></span></p></body>
