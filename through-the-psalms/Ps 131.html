David&#39;s trust challenges us to trust God. God has the power to deliver us from all enemies. No matter who or what the enemy is, God can and will deliver us. We must trust God, have faith in him. If we believe in God and trust God to empower us, He will infuse His power within us. God will strengthen us to withstand and conquer any trial or temptation. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs80275571">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csF42C4B08">BELIEVE</span><span class="cs75A07D5F"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="csA521DC07">Belief and trusting God are absolute essential. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Joh 3:15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs80275571">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Eph 6:16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs80275571">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Jas 1:5 &nbsp;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.
