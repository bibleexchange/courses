God had revealed himself to Agur through creation, and many of these lessons are drawn from his observation of nature &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pr 30:4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son&#39;s name, if thou canst tell?</span></p><p class="csCDDC8C82"><span class="cs75A07D5F">a. Guard against greed&mdash;never having enough (15-16).</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Agur was fully aware of the ugliness of greed. Remember, he had even prayed that God would give him only as much as he needed for his own sustenance (8-9). He prized contentment and he cautioned against covetousness. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Agur compared greedy people to leeches. Leeches attach themselves to living creatures and actually live off their blood. The leech&rsquo;s </span><span class="csD3860DFD">two daughters</span><span class="csA521DC07"> refers to that which it draws blood. They continuously cry, &ldquo;Give! Give!&rdquo; and are never satisfied. This is the selfish, detestable trait of the greedy; they never have enough. Agur gives four additional illustrations that describe the greedy:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs66EAF5C8"><span class="csA521DC07">The </span><span class="csD3860DFD">grave </span><span class="csA521DC07">(sheol)&mdash;the place that holds the dead (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Pr+27%3A20"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">27:20</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">; <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Hab+2%3A5"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Hab. 2:5</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). Death never retreats; it never claims its last life. It continues to crave corpses and never rejects any body. Likewise, the greedy are always craving far more, never feeling satisfied or fulfilled.</span></li><li class="cs66EAF5C8"><span class="csA521DC07">The </span><span class="csD3860DFD">barren womb</span><span class="csA521DC07">. The pain a woman suffers who desires children but cannot bear them is endless and tormenting. She feels empty and hurt. Consider the bitter desperation of Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah (<a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+16%3A1-2"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Ge.16:1-2</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">; <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=Ge+30%3A1"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">30:1</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">; <a class="cs5822FE11" href="http://www.crossbooks.com/verse.asp?ref=1Sa+1%3A5-11"><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">1 Sa.1:5-11</span></a></span><span class="csA521DC07">). Nothing can satisfy the childless woman&rsquo;s craving for a baby to hold in her arms. So it is with the greedy: a sense of desire always gnaws at their hearts and nothing ever satisfies their craving.</span></li><li class="cs66EAF5C8"><span class="csA521DC07">The </span><span class="csD3860DFD">earth that is never fully watered</span><span class="csA521DC07">. Agur lived in a dry region that suffered from frequent droughts. The land in Palestine and the surrounding areas was always thirsty. It desperately absorbed every drop of rain that fell. Just like the dry, unwatered earth, the greedy thirst for more and more, never getting enough.</span></li><li class="cs66EAF5C8"><span class="csA521DC07">The raging </span><span class="csD3860DFD">fire</span><span class="csA521DC07"> that burns out of control in the dry, brittle wilderness. It never stops, but continues to <br/>advance and spread its flames without boundaries. Greed can eat at the human soul until its flames are unquench-able&mdash;totally out of control.</span></li></ol>

As Agur observed and meditated on the world around him, he cited four natural acts that were marvelous beyond his understanding. Note that these proverbs are united by the word </span><span class="csD3860DFD">way</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (derek). Throughout </span><span class="csD3860DFD">Proverbs, </span><span class="csA521DC07">this word is commonly used to refer to the paths of the righteous and wicked. Agur marveled at the way these four marvels moved and acted. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">1) The soaring of the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">eagle</span><span class="csA521DC07"> through the air (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">v. 19a</span><span class="csA521DC07">). </span><span class="csD3860DFD">Eagle</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (nesher) is a Hebrew word for large birds in general. The same word is previously used in Pr 30:17 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the </span><span class="csF42C4B08">young eagles shall eat it</span><span class="csA521DC07">. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">The context in which it is used determines which species is in view. Eagles are known for their strength, majesty, and swiftness. Lesser birds, such as the raven and vulture, were typified as dirty scavengers. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">2) The slithering of the </span><span class="csD3860DFD">snake</span><span class="csA521DC07"> on a rock (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">v. 19b</span><span class="csA521DC07">). The snake is in contrast to the eagle. The eagle&rsquo;s strong wings lift it to great heights and catch the wind as it looks down on the earth. The snake, however, cannot move itself above the earth. It looks up at the rest of the world. It has no limbs whatsoever, but knows how to propel itself along. One travels the sky; the other crawls the earth. One glides on the wind; the other slithers on a rock. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">3) The sailing of a </span><span class="csD3860DFD">ship</span><span class="csA521DC07"> upon the open sea (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">v. 19c</span><span class="csA521DC07">). Who can look upon the great oceans without catching a glimpse of the glory and power of God? &nbsp;Agur observed ships sailing through the waves, he marveled at the wisdom and goodness of God. God has given humans the ability to design large vessels that will ride on the mighty waters without sinking. The sailor launches into the deep and with no land in sight he navigates the proper course. How? By the natural signs within the world, signs that God has placed in the sky above and the earth below.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">4) The intimacy of a </span><span class="csD3860DFD">man</span><span class="csA521DC07"> with a woman (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">v. 19d</span><span class="csA521DC07">). a beautiful, holy gift from God to a husband and wife. </span><span class="csD3860DFD">Maid </span><span class="csA521DC07">or</span><span class="csD3860DFD"> maiden</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (&lsquo;almah, also translated </span><span class="csD3860DFD">virgin</span><span class="csA521DC07">) suggests that Agur is referring to the first time a young husband and wife enjoy the full expression of their love. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">How tragic sin has so defiled this pure, beautiful gift.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Agur beheld these amazing movements, he saw a glorious God of great variety, design, purpose, beauty, and wisdom.

The secret to their strength is their unity: they are a </span><span class="csD3860DFD">people</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (&lsquo;am)&mdash;a tribe, a collective unit. They work together as one to accomplish what they are too small to do individually. If we wish to be successful in life, we, like the ant, must have foresight (plan ahead), be disciplined, unified (work with others), and work tirelessly to accomplish our tasks.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">2) The </span><span class="csD3860DFD">coney </span><span class="csA521DC07">or</span><span class="csD3860DFD"> rock badger</span><span class="csA521DC07"> (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">v. 26</span><span class="csA521DC07">). it hides itself in places where it is safe from danger.

Like the ant, they also find that their strength is their unity and their great organization. They have no recognized leader, yet they are massive and mighty:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Pr 30:27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">As an army, they march in a regular order, camp in the field at night, and in the morning rise with the sun, dry their wings, and fly in the direction of the wind. They number in the billions, covering an area up to ten miles in length and five miles wide, and have been known to fly seventeen hours at a time, covering over 1500 miles. Their vast number can blot out the sun bringing a temporary darkness over the earth. Nothing stops them - not ditch, fire, wall, door, or window. Their appetite is never satisfied; they devour all the vegetation in their path. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">God used locusts as a plague to persuade Pharaoh to release the Israelites from the bondage of slavery (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Ex.10:12-20</span><span class="csA521DC07">) and in His judgment against Judah (</span><span class="cs7C7C2F7F">Joel 1-2</span><span class="csA521DC07">).
