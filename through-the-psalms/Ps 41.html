LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Pr 4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;3 For I was my father&#39;s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not;
