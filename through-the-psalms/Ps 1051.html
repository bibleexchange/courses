For myself, I confess, that there is no care or sorrow, by which I am so severely harassed, as when I feel myself guilty of ingratitude to my most kind Lord. It not seldom appears to be a fault so inexplicable, that I am alarmed when I read these words, inasmuch as I consider them addressed to myself, and others like me. Remember, O ye forgetful, thoughtless, and ungrateful, the works of God, which he hath done to us, with so many signs and proofs of his goodness. What more could he have done, which he hath not done?&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Folengius.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 5.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Remember his marvellous works that he hath done.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Memory is never better employed than upon such topics. Alas, we are far more ready to recollect foolish and evil things than to retain in our minds the glorious deeds of Jehovah. If we would keep these in remembrance our faith would be stronger, our gratitude warmer, our devotion more fervent, and our love more intense. Shame upon us that we should let slip what it would seem impossible to forget. We ought to need no exhortation to remember such wonders, especially as he has wrought them all on the behalf of his people. His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth&mdash;these also should be had in memory. The judgments of his mouth are as memorable as the marvels of his band.

Biblical concepts of God&#39;s covenants with man.</span></p><p class="cs435601E0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A. Conditional factor in the covenant arrangements of God with man.<br/>1. There is a singularity and commonality to all of God&#39;s covenant arrangements with man.<br/>a. God created man as a choosing creature with freedom of choice.<br/>b. God always respects man&#39;s created freedom of choice<br/>c. God&#39;s divinely initiated and arranged actions toward man<br/>(1). allow for man&#39;s response and responsibility<br/>(2). expect man&#39;s receptivity to God&#39;s activity - Faith<br/>d. This condition of chosen receptivity and availability does not create a contingency of <br/>&quot;conditionalism&quot; whereby God is limited to act only when man acts.<br/>e. There are consequences to man&#39;s choices<br/>(1) Blessings and cursings<br/>Lev. 26:1-39<br/>Deut. 28:1-68<br/>(2) Privileges and penalties<br/>2. God&#39;s covenantal arrangement with physical Israel<br/>a. God made a unilateral arrangement with Moses at Sinai<br/>b. Physical peoples of Israel were expected to obey, keep, remember, do, and walk in the <br/>covenant arrangements.<br/>c. They forgot, did not continue in (Heb. 8:9), transgressed (Heb. 9:15), profaned, rejected, <br/>broke (Jere. 31:32), and sinned against those arrangements.<br/>d. They experienced the promised consequences of &quot;curses,&quot; war, sickness, exile, death, <br/>and the termination of the covenant arrangement.<br/>3. God&#39;s new covenant arrangement with Christians<br/>a. God made unilateral arrangement with mankind through His Son, Jesus Christ.<br/>John 3:16 - &quot;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son..&quot;<br/>b. Men are expected to receive God&#39;s grace in Christ by the receptivity of faith <br/>Eph. 2:8,9 - &quot;for by grace you have been saved through faith&quot;<br/>c. Such receptivity of faith must be maintained in the dynamic relationship of the <br/>Christian life<br/>Col. 2:6 - &quot;As you have received Christ Jesus, so walk in Him&quot;<br/>d. There are consequences to our choices<br/>Col. 3:25 - &quot;he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he <br/>has done, without partiality&quot;<br/>I Cor. 3:13 - &quot;the fire will test the quality of each man&#39;s work&quot;<br/>B. Change in God&#39;s covenant arrangement with man does not impinge upon the immutable, <br/>unchanging character of God.<br/>1. God is immutable and unchanging<br/>Mal. 3:6 - &quot;I, the Lord, do not change&quot;<br/>Heb. 6:17,18 - &quot;unchangeableness of His purposes&quot;<br/>2. God can change what He does, His </span><span class="csC382D2BB">modus operandi</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, without changing who He is or His <br/>purpose and objective.<br/>a. Must not make God&#39;s being and character contingent on His performance and activity; <br/>Not: &quot;To do is to be&quot;<br/>b. A change in covenant arrangement is not a change in God<br/>3. God can have predetermined change within His unchanging purpose.<br/>a. The transition from old covenant arrangement to new covenant arrangements was part <br/>of God&#39;s eternal plan; not &quot;Plan B&quot;<br/>b. The unchanging continuity of God&#39;s purpose is in Jesus Christ; no duality of purpose.<br/>C. Eternality of God&#39;s covenants with man.<br/>1. God is eternal<br/>a.

God&#39;s covenant arrangements are referred to as &quot;eternal&quot;<br/>a. old covenant - Gen. 9:16; 17:7,13,19; Lev. 24:8; II Sam. 23:5; I Chron. 16:7; Ps. 105:10;<br/>Isa. 24:5; 55:3;61:8; Jere. 32:40; 50:5; Ezek. 37:26 <br/>(1) Hebrew word can mean &quot;long time&quot; or &quot;long duration&quot; - cf. Isa. 42:14; 57:69; 64:5<br/>(2) Such &quot;eternal&quot; covenants superseded and fulfilled according to spiritual intent<br/>(a) Gen. 17:13 - Rom. 2:28,29<br/>(b) Exod. 40:15 - Heb. 7:24<br/>b. new covenant - Heb. 13:20<br/>3. The eternality of God should not be attributed to some &quot;thing,&quot; such as a covenant <br/>arrangement<br/>a. God&#39;s eternality is expressed ontologically<br/>b. When the Being of God is being expressed in the midst of His covenant arrangements, <br/>then quantitative and qualitative eternality is functioning.<br/>D. Covenant differentiated from &quot;contract&quot;<br/>1. Binding contracts can be covenant arrangements<br/>2. God&#39;s new covenant arrangements with man should not be cast primarily into <br/>legal-contractual context.<br/>a. A contract, if unilateral, becomes a deterministic imposition by a superior party<br/>b. A contract, if bilateral between equal parties, often allows for unenforceable liberties to <br/>violate with impunity.<br/>c. Legal contracts usually have categorical imperatives: &quot;Thou shalt...&quot;, Do this...<br/>(1) stipulations, requirements, binding conditions<br/>(2) leads to legalism and &quot;works&quot;<br/>d. Such obligatory obedience often makes God&#39;s action contingent on man&#39;s action.<br/>3. God&#39;s new covenant arrangements do not have contractual features<br/>a. Initiated by God&#39;s grace, maintained and preserved by God&#39;s grace<br/>b. God acts indicative of His Being, rather than imposing imperatives.<br/>(1) Promises<br/>(2) I AM..; I will..; This is how it is designed to function<br/>c.

Religion always tries to turn &quot;covenant&quot; into &quot;contract&quot;<br/>a. False view of obedience<br/>b. Bargain with God<br/>E. Covenant not to be equated with &quot;testament&quot;<br/>1. A &quot;last will and testament&quot; can be a covenant arrangement<br/>a. Two passages in NT often interpreted in such context<br/>Gal. 3:15<br/>Heb. 9:15-17<br/>b. These two passages are not necessarily to be interpreted in such a testator/testamental <br/>context<br/>2. The idea of covenant arrangement is much broader than a legal death and distribution <br/>document<br/>3. The human titling of the &quot;New Testament&quot; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">He Kaine Diatheke</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) can give a wrong <br/>impression of new covenant realities in Christ<br/>a. projecting such as inheritance &quot;rights&quot; in the future at our death<br/>b. allowing a body of literature to be regarded as &quot;covenant&quot;<br/>(1) Old testament literature referred to as &quot;book of covenant&quot; - Exod 24:8; II Kgs. 23:2; <br/>II Cor. 3:14<br/>(2) The literature itself must not be regarded as the &quot;covenant&quot; or &quot;written contract&quot;</span></p><p class="cs435601E0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">III.

The comprehensive context of the New Testament refers to the differentiation between the <br/>old covenant and the new covenant arrangements of God with man.<br/>1. There is not an arbitrary sequence of covenants<br/>2. There are two major covenantal arrangements (Gal. 4:24)<br/>3. The epistle to the Hebrews in particular refers to the old covenant and the new covenant. <br/>(Heb. 8:8; 9:15; 12:24)<br/>a. The new is &quot;better&quot; than the old (Heb. 7:22; 8:6)<br/>b.

Constancy of God&#39;s spiritual operation throughout time<br/>d. Salvific efficacy and existence of Church prior to redemptive work of Jesus Christ.<br/>C. Addressing the tenets and concerns of the popular theologies<br/>1. The new covenant is not a renegotiated and modified renewal or extension of the old <br/>covenant. (Covenant theology)<br/>2. A new covenant arrangement does not impinge upon the immutability, unchangeableness <br/>of God (Covenant theology&#39;s concern)<br/>3. The new covenant is not a postponed fulfillment of the physical promises of God to the <br/>Jewish people (Dispensational theology)<br/>4. The new covenant is not an abandonment or rejection of the Jewish people <br/>(Dispensational theology&#39;s concern)<br/>5. The new covenant was God&#39;s intent from the beginning to fulfill His promises and restore <br/>mankind spiritually by His Son, Jesus Christ.<br/>D. Christocentric theology<br/>1. Recognizes that all of God&#39;s intents and purposes are centered in Jesus Christ.<br/>2. Commences with the ontological character of God.<br/>a.

Our last psalm sang the opening chapters of Genesis, and this takes up its closing chapters and conducts us into Exodus and Numbers. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The first verses are full of joyful praise, and call upon the people to extol Jehovah, Ps 105:1-7; then the earliest days of the infant nation, are described, Ps 105:8-15; the going into Egypt, Ps 105:16-23, the coming forth from it with the Lord&#39;s outstretched arm, Ps 105:24-38, the journeying through the wilderness and the entrance into Canaan. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">We are now among the long Psalms, as at other times we have been among the short ones. These varying lengths of the sacred poems should teach us not to lay down any law either of brevity or prolixity in either prayer or praise. Short petitions and single verses of hymns are often the best for public occasions, but there are seasons when a whole night of wrestling or an entire day of psalm slinging will be none too long. The Spirit is ever free in his operations, and is not to be confined with, the rules of conventional propriety. The wind bloweth as it listeth, and at one time rushes in short and rapid sweep, while at another it continues to refresh the earth hour after hour with its reviving breath. </span></p><p class="cs40314EBF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCF6BBF71">EXPOSITION</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 1.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> O give thanks unto the Lord. Jehovah is the author of all our benefits, therefore let him have all our gratitude. Call upon his name, or call him by his name; proclaim his titles and fill the world with his renown. Make known his deeds among the people, or among the nations. Let the heathen hear of our God, that they may forsake their idols and learn to worship him. The removal of the ark was a fit occasion for proclaiming aloud the glories of the Great King, and for publishing to all mankind the greatness of his doings, for it had a history in connection with the nations which it was well for them to remember with reverence. The rest of the psalm is a sermon, of which these first verses constitute the text. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 2.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Sing unto him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Bring your best thoughts and express them in the best language to the sweetest sounds. Take care that your singing is &quot;unto him, &quot;and not merely for the sake of the music or to delight the ears of others. Singing is so delightful an exercise that it is a pity so much or it should be wasted upon trifles or worse than trifles. O ye who can emulate the nightingale, and almost rival the angels, we do most earnestly pray that your hearts may be renewed that so your floods of melody may be poured out at your Maker&#39;s and Redeemer&#39;s feet. Talk ye of all his wondrous works. Men love to speak of marvels, and others are generally glad to hear of surprising things; surely the believer in the living God has before him the most amazing series of wonders ever heard of or imagined, his themes are inexhaustible and they are such as should hold men spellbound. We ought to have more of this &quot;talk&quot;: no one would be blamed as a Mr. Talkative if this were his constant theme. Talk ye, all of you: you all know something by experience of the marvellous loving kindness of the Lord&mdash;&quot;talk ye.&quot; In this way, by all dwelling on this blessed subject, &quot;all&quot; his wondrous works will be published. One cannot do it, nor ten thousand times ten thousand, but if all speak to the Lord&#39;s honour, they will at least come nearer to accomplishing the deed. We ought to have a wide range when conversing upon the Lord&#39;s doings, and should not shut our eyes to any part of them. Talk ye of his wondrous works in creation and in grace, in judgment and in mercy, in providential interpositions and in spiritual comforting; leave out none, or it will be to your damage. Obedience to this verse will give every sanctified tongue some work to do: the trained musicians can sing, and the commoner voices can talk, and in both ways the Lord will receive a measure of the thanks due to him, and his deeds will be made known among the people. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 3.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Glory ye in his holy name.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Make it a matter of joy that you have such a God. His character and attributes are such as will never make you blush to call him your God. Idolaters may well be ashamed of the actions attributed to their fancied deities, their names are foul with lust and red with blood, but Jehovah is wholly glorious; every deed of his will bear the strictest scrutiny; his name is holy, his character is holy, his law is holy, his government is holy, his influence is holy. In all this we may make our boast, nor can any deny our right to do so. Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. If they have not yet found him so fully as they desire, yet even to be allowed and enabled to seek after such a God is cause for gladness, To worship the Lord and seek his kingdom and righteousness is the sure way to happiness, mad indeed there is no other. True seekers throw their hearts into the engagement, hence their hearts receive joy; according to the text they have a permit to rejoice and they have the promise that they shall do so. How happy all these sentences are! Where can men&#39;s ears be when they talk of the gloom of psalm singing? What worldly songs are fuller of real mirth? One hears the sound of the timbrel and the harp in every verse. Even seekers find bliss in the name of the Lord Jesus, but as for the finders, we may say with the poet, </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;And those who find thee find a bliss,<br/>Nor tongue nor pen Call show:<br/>The love of Jesus what it is,<br/>None but his loved ones know.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 4.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Seek the Loan and his strength.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Put yourselves under his protection. Regard him not as a puny God, but look unto his omnipotence, and seek to know the power of his grace. We all need strength; let us look to the strong One for it. We need infinite power to bear us safely to our eternal resting place, let us look to the Almighty Jehovah for it. Seek his face evermore. Seek, seek, seek, we have the word three times, and though the words differ in the Hebrew, the sense is the same. It must be a blessed thing to seek, or we should not be thus stirred up to do so. To seek his face is to desire his presence, his smile, his favour consciously enjoyed. First we seek him, then his strength and then his face; from the personal reverence, we pass on to the imparted power, and then to the conscious favour. This seeking must never cease&mdash;the more we know the more we must seek to know. Finding him, we must &quot;our minds inflame to seek him more and more.&quot; He seeks spiritual worshippers, and spiritual worshippers seek him; they are therefore sure to meet face to face ere long. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 5.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Remember his marvellous works that he hath done.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Memory is never better employed than upon such topics. Alas, we are far more ready to recollect foolish and evil things than to retain in our minds the glorious deeds of Jehovah. If we would keep these in remembrance our faith would be stronger, our gratitude warmer, our devotion more fervent, and our love more intense. Shame upon us that we should let slip what it would seem impossible to forget. We ought to need no exhortation to remember such wonders, especially as he has wrought them all on the behalf of his people. His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth&mdash;these also should be had in memory. The judgments of his mouth are as memorable as the marvels of his band. God had but to speak and the enemies of his people were sorely afflicted; his threats were not mere words, but smote his adversaries terribly. As the Word of God is the salvation of his saints, so is it the destruction of the ungodly: out of his mouth goeth a two edged sword with which he will slay the wicked. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 6.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">chosen.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Should all the world forget, ye are bound to remember. Your father Abraham saw his wonders and judgments upon Sodom, and upon the kings who came from far, and Jacob also saw the Lord&#39;s marvellous works in visiting the nations with famine, yet providing for his chosen a choice inheritance in a goodly land; therefore let the children praise their father&#39;s God. The Israelites were the Lord&#39;s elect nation, and they were bound to imitate their progenitor, who was the Lord&#39;s faithful servant and walked before him in holy faith: the seed of Abraham should not be unbelieving, nor should the children of so true a servant become rebels. As we read this pointed appeal to the chosen seed we should recognise the special claims which the Lord has upon ourselves, since we too have been favoured above all others. Election is not a couch for case, but an argument for sevenfold diligence. If God has set his choice upon us, let us aim to be choice men. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs1B16EEB5">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 7.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He is the Lord our God.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Blessed be his name. Jehovah condescends to be our God. This sentence contains a greater wealth of meaning than all the eloquence of orators can compass, and there is more joy in it than in all the sonnets of them that make merry. His judgments are in all the earth, or in all the land, for the whole of the country was instructed by his law, ruled by his statutes, and protected by his authority. What a joy it is that our God is never absent from us, he is never nonresident, never an absentee ruler, his judgments are in all the places in which we dwell. If the second clause of this verse refers to the whole world, it is very beautiful to see the speciality of Israel&#39;s election united with the universality of Jehovah&#39;s reign. Not alone to the one nation did the Lord reveal himself, but his glory flashed around the globe. It is wonderful that the Jewish people should have become so exclusive, and have so utterly lost the missionary spirit, for their sacred literature is full of the broad and generous sympathies which are so consistent with the worship of &quot;the God of the whole earth.&quot; Nor is it less painful to observe that among a certain class of believers in God&#39;s election of grace there lingers a hard exclusive spirit, fatal to compassion and zeal. It would be well for these also to remember that their Redeemer is &quot;the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 8.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He hath remembered his covenant for ever.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Here is the basis of all his dealings with his people: he had entered into covenant with them in their father Abraham, and to this covenant he remained faithful. The exhortation to remember (Ps 105:5) receives great force from the fact that God has remembered. If the Lord has his promise in memory surely we ought not to forget the wonderful manner in which he keeps it. To us it should be matter for deepest joy that never in any instance has the Lord been unmindful of his covenant engagements, nor will he be so world without end. O that we were as mindful of them as he is. The word which he commanded to a thousand generations. This is only an amplification of the former statement, and serves to set before us the immutable fidelity of the Lord during the changing generations of men. His judgments are threatened upon the third and fourth generations of them that hate him, but his love runs on for ever, even to &quot;a thousand generations.&quot; His promise is here said to be commanded, or vested with all the authority of a law. It is a proclamation from a sovereign, the firman of an Emperor whose laws shall stand fast in every jot and tittle though heaven and earth shall pass away. Therefore let us give thanks unto the Lord and talk of all his wondrous works, so wonderful for their faithfulness and truth. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 9.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Which covenant he made with Abraham.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> When the victims were divided and the burning lamp passed between the pieces (Gen. 15.) then the Lord made, or ratified, the covenant with the patriarch. This was a solemn deed, performed not without blood, and the cutting in pieces of the sacrifice; it points us to the greater covenant which in Christ Jesus is signed, sealed, and ratified, that it may stand fast for ever and ever. And his oath unto Isaac. Isaac did not in vision see the solemn making of the covenant, but the Lord renewed unto him his oath (Ge 26:2-5). This was enough for him, and must have established his faith in the Most High. We have the privilege of seeing in our Lord Jesus both the sacrificial seal, and the eternal oath of God, by which every promise of the covenant is made yea and amen to all the chosen seed. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 10.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Jacob in his wondrous dream (Ge 28:10-15) received a pledge that the Lord&#39;s mode of procedure with him would be in accordance with covenant relations: for said Jehovah, &quot;I will not leave thee till I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.&quot; Thus, if we may so speak with all reverence, the covenant became a law unto the Lord himself by which he bound himself to act. O matchless condescension, that the most free and sovereign Lord should put himself under covenant bonds to Iris chosen, and make a law for himself, though he is above all law. And to Israel for an everlasting covenant. When he changed Jacob&#39;s name he did not change his covenant, but it is written, &quot;he blessed him there&quot; (Ge 32:29), and it was with the old blessing, according to the unchangeable word of abiding grace. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 11.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">of your inheritance.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> This repetition of the great covenant promise is recorded in Ge 35:9-12 in connection with the change of Jacob&#39;s name, and very soon after that slaughter of the Shechemites, which had put the patriarch into such great alarm and caused him to use language almost identical with that of the next verse. When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers </span><span class="csC382D2BB">in it.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, &quot;Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, and my house.&quot; Thus the fears of the man of God declared themselves, and they were reasonable if we look only at the circumstances in which he was placed, but they are soon seen to be groundless when we remember that the covenant promise, which guaranteed the possession of the land, necessarily implied the preservation of the race to whom the promise was made. We often fear where no fear is. The blessings promised to the seed of Abraham were not dependent upon the number of his descendants, or their position in this world. The covenant was made with one man, and consequently the number could never be less, and that one man was not the owner of a foot of soil in all the land, save only a cave in which to bury his dead, and therefore his seed could not have less inheritance than he. The smallness of a church, and the poverty of its members, are no barriers to the divine blessing, if it be sought earnestly by pleading the promise. Were not the apostles few, and the disciples feeble, when the good work began? Neither because we are strangers and foreigners here below, as our fathers were, are we in any the more danger: we are like sheep in the midst of wolves, but the wolves cannot hurt us, for our shepherd is near. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 12.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">When they were but a few men in number.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> bpom ytm.

The little wandering family might have been cut off root and branch had not a special mandate been issued from the throne for their protection. It was not the gentleness of their neighbours which screened them; they were hedged about by the mysterious guardianship of heaven. Whether in Egypt, or in Philistia, or in Canaan, the heirs of the promises, dwelling in their tents, were always secure. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 14.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He suffered no man to do them wrong.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Men cannot wrong us unless he suffers them to do so; the greatest of them must wait his permission before they can place a finger upon us. The wicked would devour us if they could, but they cannot even cheat us of a farthing without divine sufferance. Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes. Pharaoh and Abimelech must both be made to respect the singular strangers who had come to sojourn in their land; the greatest kings are very second rate persons with God in comparison with his chosen servants. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 15.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Saying, touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">harm.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Abraham and his seed were in the midst of the world a generation of priests anointed to present sacrifice unto the most High God; since to them the oracles were committed, they were also the prophets of mankind; and they were kings too&mdash;a royal priesthood; hence they had received a threefold anointing. Their holy office surrounded them with a sacredness which rendered it sacrilege to molest them. The Lord was pleased to impress the wild tribes of Canaan with a respectful awe of the pious strangers who had come to abide with them, so that they came not near them to do them ill. The words here mentioned may not have been actually spoken, but the impression of awe which fell upon the nations is thus poetically described. God will not have those touched who have been set apart unto himself He calls them his own, saying, &quot;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Mine</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> anointed&quot; he declares that he has </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;anointed&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> them to be prophets, priests, and kings unto himself, and yet again he claims them as his prophets&mdash;&quot;Do </span><span class="csC382D2BB">my</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">prophets</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> no harm.&quot; All through the many years in which the three great fathers dwelt in Canaan no man was able to injure them; they were not able to defend themselves by force of arms; but the eternal God was their refuge. Even so at this present time the remnant according to the election of grace cannot be destroyed, nay, nor so much as touched, without the divine consent. Against the church of Christ the gates of hell cannot prevail. In all this we see reasons for giving thanks unto the Lord, and proclaiming his name according to the exhortation of the first verse of the Psalm. Here ends the portion which was sung at the moving of the ark: its fitness to be used for such a purpose is very manifest, for the ark was the symbol both of the covenant and of that mystic dwelling of God with Israel which was at once her glory and her defence. None could touch the Lord&#39;s peculiar ones, for the Lord was among them, flaming forth in majesty between the cherubims. The presence of God having remained with his chosen ones while they sojourned in Canaan, it did not desert them when they were called to go down into Egypt. They did not go there of their own choice, but under divine direction, and hence the Lord prepared their way and prospered them until he saw fit to conduct them again to the land of promise. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 16.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Moreover he called for a famine upon the land.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> He had only to call for it as a man calls for his servant, and it came at once. How grateful ought we to be that he does not often call in that terrible servant of his, so meagre and gaunt, and grim, so pitiless to the women and the children, so bitter to the strong men, who utterly fail before it. He brake the whole staff of bread. Man&#39;s feeble life cannot stand without its staff&mdash;if bread fail him he fails. As a cripple with a broken staff falls to the ground, so does man when broad no longer sustains him. To God it is as easy to make a famine as to break a stall He could make that famine universal, too, so that all countries should be in like case: then would the race of man fall indeed, and its staff would be broken for ever. There is this sweet comfort in the matter, that the Lord has wise ends to serve even by famine: he meant his people to go down into Egypt, and the scarcity of food was his method of leading them there, for &quot;they heard that there was corn in Egypt.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 17.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He sent a man before them, even Joseph.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> He was the advance guard and pioneer for the whole clan. His brethren sold him, but God sent him. Where the hand of the wicked is visible God&#39;s hand may be invisibly at work, overruling their malice. No one was more of a man, or more fit to lead the van than Joseph: an interpreter of dreams was wanted, and his brethren had said of him, &quot;Behold, this dreamer cometh.&quot; Who was sold for a servant, or rather for a slave. Joseph&#39;s journey into Egypt was not so costly as Jonah&#39;s voyage when he paid his own fare: his free passage was provided by the Midianites, who also secured his introduction to a great officer of state by handing him over as a Slave. His way to a position in which he could feed his family lay through the pit, the slaver&#39;s caravan, the slave market and the prison, and who shall deny but what it was the right way, the surest way, the wisest way, and perhaps the shortest way. Yet assuredly it seemed not so. Were we to send a man on such an errand we should furnish him with money&mdash;Joseph goes as a pauper; we should clothe him with authority&mdash;Joseph goes as a slave; we should leave him at full liberty&mdash;Joseph is a bondman: yet money would have been of little use when corn was so dear, authority would have been irritating rather than influential with Pharaoh, and freedom might not have thrown Joseph into connection with Pharaoh&#39;s captain and his other servants, and so the knowledge of his skill in interpretation might not have reached the monarch&#39;s ear. God way is the way. Our Lord&#39;s path to his mediatorial throne ran by the cross of Calvary; our road to glory runs by the rivers of grief. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 18.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Whose feet they hurt with fetters.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> From this we learn a little more of Joseph&#39;s sufferings than we find in the book of Genesis: inspiration had not ceased, and David was as accurate an historian as Moses, for the same Spirit guided his pen. He was laid in iron, or &quot;into iron came his soul.&quot; The prayer book version, &quot;the iron entered into his soul, &quot;is ungrammatical, but probably expresses much the same truth. His fetters hurt his mind as well as his body, and well did Jacob say, &quot;The archers shot at him, and sorely grieved him.&quot; Under the cruelly false accusation, which he could not disprove, his mind was, as it were, belted and bolted around with iron, and had not the Lord been with him he might have sunk under his sufferings. In all this, and a thousand things besides, he was an admirable type of him who in the highest sense is &quot;the Shepherd, the stone of Israel.&quot; The iron fetters were preparing him to wear chains of gold, and making his feet ready to stand on high places. It is even so with all the Lord&#39;s afflicted ones, they too shall one day step from their prisons to their thrones. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 19.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Until the time that his word came.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> God has his times, and his children must wait till his &quot;until&quot; is fulfilled. Joseph was tried as in a furnace, until the Lord&#39;s assaying work was fully accomplished. The word of the chief butler was nothing, he had to wait until God&#39;s word came, and meanwhile the word of the Lord tried him. He believed the promise, but his faith was sorely exercised. A delayed blessing tests men, and proves their metal, whether their faith is of that precious kind which can endure the fire. Of many a choice promise we may say with Daniel &quot;the thing was true, but the time appointed was long.&quot; If the vision tarry it is good to wait for it with patience. There is a trying word and a delivering word, and we must bear the one till the other comes to us. How meekly Joseph endured his afflictions, and with what fortitude he looked forward to the clearing of his slandered character we may readily imagine: it will be better still if under similar trials we are able to imitate him, and come forth from the furnace as thoroughly purified as he was, and as well prepared to bear the yet harder ordeal of honour and power. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 20.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The king sent and loosed him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> He was thrust into the roundhouse by an officer, but he was released by the monarch himself. Even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. The tide had turned, so that Egypt&#39;s haughty potentate gave him a call from the prison to the palace. He had interpreted the dreams of captives, himself a captive; he must now interpret for a ruler and become a ruler himself. When God means to enlarge his prisoners, kings become his turnkeys. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 21.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He made him lord of his house.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Reserving no power, but saying &quot;only in the throne will I be greater than thou.&quot; The servitor of slaves becomes lord over nobles. How soon the Lord lifteth his chosen from the dunghill to set them among princes. And ruler of all his substance. He empowered him to manage the storing of the seven plenteous harvests, and to dispense the provisions in the coming days of scarcity. All the treasures of Egypt were under his lock and key, yea, the granaries of the world were sealed or opened at his bidding. Thus was he in the best conceivable position for preserving alive the house of Israel with whom the covenant was made. As our Lord was himself secured in Egypt from Herod&#39;s enmity, so, ages before, the redeemed race found an equally available shelter, in the hour of need. God has always a refuge for his saints, and if the whole earth could not afford them sanctuary, the Lord himself would be their dwelling place, and take them up to lie in his own bosom. We are always sure to be fed if all the world should starve. It is delightful to think of our greater Joseph ruling the nations for the good of his own household, and it becomes us to abide in quiet confidence in every political disaster, since Jesus is on the throne of providence, King of kings and Lord of lords, and will be so till this dispensation ends. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 22.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">To bind his princes at his pleasure.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> He who was bound obtains authority to bind. He is no longer kept in prison, but keeps all the prisons, and casts into them the greatest nobles when justice demands it. And teach his senators wisdom. The heads of the various peoples, the elders of the nations, learned from him the science of government, the art of providing for the people. Joseph was a great instructor in political economy, and we doubt not that he mingled with it the purest morals, the most upright jurisprudence, and something of that divine wisdom without which the most able senators remain in darkness. The king&#39;s authority made him absolute both in the executive and in the legislative courts, and the Lord instructed him to use his power with discretion. What responsibilities and honours loaded the man who had been rejected by his brothers, and sold for twenty pieces of silver! What glories crown the head of that greater one who was &quot;separated from his brethren.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 23.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Israel also came into Egypt.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The aged patriarch came, and with him that increasing company which bore his name. He was hard to bring there. Perhaps nothing short of the hope of seeing Joseph could have drawn him to take so long a journey from the tombs of his forefathers; but the divine will was accomplished and the church of God was removed into an enemy&#39;s country, where for a while it was nourished. And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. Shem the blessed came to lodge awhile with Ham the accursed: the dove was in the vulture&#39;s nest. God so willed it for a time, and therefore it was safe and right: still it was only a sojourn, not a settlement. The fairest Goshen in Egypt was not the covenant blessing, neither did the Lord mean his people to think it so; even so to us &quot;earth is our lodge&quot; but only our lodge, for heaven is our home. When we are best housed we ought still to remember that here we have no continuing city. It were ill news for us if we were doomed to reside in Egypt for ever, for all its riches are not worthy to be compared with the reproach of Christ. Thus the song rehearsed the removals of the Lord&#39;s people, and was a most fit accompaniment to the bearing up of the ark, as the priest carried it into the city of David, where the Lord had appointed it a resting place. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 24.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">And he increased his people greatly.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> In Goshen they seem to have increased rapidly from the first, and this excited the fears of the Egypt, inns, so that they tried to retard their increase by oppression, but the Lord continued to bless them, And made them stronger than their enemies. Both in physical strength and in numbers they threatened to become the more powerful race. Nor was this growth of the nation impeded by tyrannical measures, but the very reverse took place, thus giving an early instance of what has since become a proverb in the church&mdash;&quot;the more they oppressed them the more they multiplied.&quot; It is idle to contend either with God or his people. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 25.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He turned their hearts to hate his people.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> It was his goodness to Israel which called forth the ill will of the Egyptian court, and so far the Lord caused it, and moreover he made use of this feeling to lead on to the discomfort of his people, and so to their readiness to leave the land to which they had evidently become greatly attached. Thus far but no further did the Lord turn the hearts of the Egyptians. God cannot in any sense be the author of sin so far as to be morally responsible for its existence, but it often happens through the evil which is inherent in human nature that the acts of the Lord arouse the ill feelings of ungodly men. Is the sun to be blamed because while it softens wax it hardens clay? Is the orb of day to be accused of creating the foul exhalations which are drawn by its warmth from the pestilential marsh? The sun causes the reek of the dunghill only in a certain sense had it been a bed of flowers his beams would have called forth fragrance. The evil is in men, and the honour of turning it to good and useful purposes is with the Lord. Hatred is often allied with cunning, and so in the case of the Egyptians, they began to deal subtilly with his servants. They treated them in a fraudulent manner, they reduced them to bondage by their exactions, they secretly concerted the destruction of their male children, and at length openly ordained that cruel measure, and all with the view of checking their increase, lest in time of war they should side with invaders in order to obtain their liberty. Surely the depths of Satanic policy were here reached, but vain was the cunning of man against the chosen seed. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 26.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> When the oppression was at the worst, Moses came. For the second time we have here the expression, &quot;he sent&quot;; he who sent Joseph sent also Moses and his eloquent brother. The Lord had the men in readiness and all he had to do was to commission them and thrust them forward. They were two, for mutual comfort and strength, even as the apostles and the seventy in our Lord&#39;s day were sent forth two and two. The men differed, and so the one became the supplement of the other, and together they were able to accomplish far more than if they had been exactly alike: the main point was that they were both sent, and hence both clothed with divine might. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 27.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">of Ham.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The miracles which were wrought by Moses were the Lord&#39;s, not his own: signs, as being the marks of Jehovah&#39;s presence hence they are here called &quot;his&quot; and power. The plagues were &quot;words of his signs&quot; (see margin), that is to say, they were speaking marvels, which testified more plainly than words to the omnipotence of Jehovah, to his determination to be obeyed, to his anger at the obstinacy of Pharaoh. Never were discourses more plain, pointed, personal, or powerful, and yet it took ten of them to accomplish the end designed. In the preaching of the gospel there are words, and signs, and wonders and these leave men without excuse for their impenitence; to have the kingdom of God come nigh unto them, and yet to remain rebellious is the unhappy sin of obstinate spirits. Those are wonders of sin who see wonders of grace, and yet are unaffected by them: bad as he was, Pharaoh had not this guilt, for the prodigies which lie beheld were marvels of judgment and not of mercy. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 28.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He sent darkness, and made it dark.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> It was no natural or common darkness to be accounted for by the blinding dust of the simoon, it was beyond all precedent and out of the range of ordinary events. It was a horrible palpable obscurity which men felt clinging about them as though it were a robe of death. It was a thick darkness, a total darkness, a darkness which lasted three days, a darkness in which no one dared to stir. What a condition to be in! This plague is first mentioned, thought it is not first in order, because it fitly describes all the period of the plagues: the land was in the darkness of sorrow, and in the darkness of sin all the time. If we shudder as we think of that long and terrible gloom, let us reflect upon the gross darkness which still covers heathen lands as the result of sin, for it is one of the chief plagues which iniquity creates for itself. May the day soon come when the people which sit in darkness shall see a great light. And they rebelled not against his word. Moses and Aaron did as they were bidden, and during the darkness the Egyptians were so cowed that even when it cleared away they were anxious for Israel to be gone, and had it not been for the pride of Pharaoh they would have rejoiced to speed them on their journey there and then. God can force men to obey, and even make the stoutest hearts eager to pay respect to his will, for fear his plagues should be multiplied. Possibly, however, the sentence before us neither refers to Moses nor the Egyptians, but to the plagues which came at the Lord&#39;s bidding. The darkness, the hail, the frogs, the murrain, were all so many obedient servants of the great Lord of all. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 29.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> So that the plague was not a mere colouring of the water with red earth, as some suppose, but the river was offensive and fatal to the fish. The beloved Nile and other streams were all equally tainted and ensanguined. Their commonest mercy became their greatest curse. Water is one of the greatest blessings, and the more plentiful it is the better, but blood is a hideous sight to look upon, and to see rivers and pools of it is frightful indeed. Fish in Egypt furnished a large part of the food supply, and it was no small affliction to see them floating dead and white upon a stream of crimson. The hand of the Lord thus smote them where all classes of the people would become aware of it and suffer from it. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 30.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Their land brought forth frogs in abundance.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> If fish could not live frogs might, yea, they multiplied both on land and in the water till they swarmed beyond all count. In the chambers of their kings. They penetrated the choicest rooms of the palace, and were found upon the couches of state. The Lord called for them and they marched forth. Obnoxious and even loathsome their multitudes became, but there was no resisting them; they seemed to spring out of the ground, the very land brought them forth. Their universal presence must have inspired horror and disgust which would cause sickness and make life a burden; their swarming even in the king&#39;s own chambers was a rebuke to his face, which his pride must have felt. Kings are no more than other men with God, nay less than others when they are first in rebellion; if the frogs had abounded elsewhere, but had been kept out of his select apartments, the monarch would have cared little, for he was a heartless being, but God took care that there should be a special horde of the invaders for the palace; they were more than ordinarily abundant in the chambers of their kings. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 31.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He spake.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> See the power of the divine word. He had only to say it and it was done: and there came divers sorts of flies. Insects of various annoying kinds came up in infinite hordes, a mixture of biting, stinging, buzzing gnats, mosquitos, files, beetles, and other vermin such as make men&#39;s flesh their prey, the place of deposit for their eggs, and the seat of peculiar torments. And lice in all their coasts. These unutterably loathsome forms of life were as the dust of the ground, and covered their persons, their garments, and all they ate. Nothing is too small to master man when God commands it to assail him. The sons of Ham had despised the Israelites and now they were made to loathe themselves. The meanest beggars were more approachable than the proud Egyptians; they were reduced to the meanest condition of filthiness, and the most painful state of irritation. What armies the Lord can send forth when once his right arm is bared for war! And what scorn he pours on proud nations when he fights them, not with angels, but with lice! Pharaoh had little left to be proud of when his own person was invaded by filthy parasites. It was a slap in the face which ought to have humbled his heart, but, alas, man, when he is altogether polluted, still maintains his self conceit, and when he is the most disgusting object in the universe he still vaunts himself. Surely pride is moral madness. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 32.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He gave them hail for rain.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> They seldom had rain, but now the showers assumed the form of heavy, destructive hail storms, and being accompanied with a hurricane and thunderstorm, they were overwhelming, terrible, and destructive. And flaming fire in their land. The lightning was peculiarly vivid, and seemed to run along upon the ground, or fall in fiery flakes. Thus all the fruit of the trees and the harvests of the fields were either broken to pieces or burned on the spot, and universal fear bowed the hearts of men to the dust. No phenomena are more appalling to the most of mankind than those which attend a thunderstorm; even the most audacious blasphemers quail when the dread artillery of heaven opens fire upon the earth. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 33.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He smote their vines also and their fig trees.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> So that all hope of gathering their best fruits was gone, and the trees were injured for future bearing. All the crops were destroyed, and these are mentioned as being the more prominent forms of their produce, used by them both at festivals and in common meals. And brake the trees of their coasts. From end to end of Egypt the trees were battered and broken by the terrible hailstorm. God is in earnest when he deals with proud spirits, he will either end them or mend them. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 34.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He spoke, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> One word from the Captain and the armies leap forward. The expression is very striking, and sets forth the immediate result of the divine word. The caterpillar is called the licker, because it seems to lick up every green thing as in a moment. Perhaps the caterpillar here meant is still the locust in another form. That locusts swarm in countless armies is a fact of ordinary observation, and the case would be worse on this occasion. We have ourselves ridden for miles through armies of locusts, and we have seen with our own eyes how completely they devour every green thing. The description is not strained when we read, &quot;And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.&quot; Nothing escapes these ravenous creatures, they even climb the trees to reach any remnant of foliage which may survive. Commissioned as these were by God, we may be sure they would do their work thoroughly, and leave behind them nothing but a desolate wilderness. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 35.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Did eat up all the herbs.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> The locusts had devoured every green herb and every blade of grass; and had it not been for the reeds, on which our cattle entirely subsisted while we skirted the banks of the river, the journey must have been discontinued, at least in the line that had been proposed. The larvae, as generally is the case in this class of nature, are much more voracious than the perfect insect; nothing that is green seems to come amiss to them. The traces of their route over the country are very obvious for many weeks after they have passed it, the surface appearing as if swept by a broom, or as if a harrow had been drawn over it. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">John Barrow</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, 1764-1849. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 36.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Are smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">of all their strength.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Now came the master blow. The Lord spoke before, but now he smites; before he only smote vines, but now he strikes men themselves. The glory of the household dies in a single night, the prime and pick of the nation are cut off, the flower of the troops, the heirs of the rich, and the hopes of the poor all die at midnight. Now the target was struck in the centre, there was no confronting this plague. Pharaoh feels it as much as the woman slave at the mill: he had smitten Israel, the Lord&#39;s firstborn, and the Lord repaid him to his face. What a cry went up throughout the land of Egypt when every house wailed its firstborn at the dead of night! O Jehovah, thou didst triumph in that hour, and with an outstretched arm didst thou deliver thy people. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 37.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He brought them forth also with silver and gold.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> This they asked of the Egyptians, perhaps even demanded, and well they might, for they had been robbed and spoiled for many a day, and it was not meet that they should go forth empty handed. Glad were the Egyptians to hand over their jewels to propitiate a people who had such a terrible friend above; they needed no undue pressure, they feared them too much to deny them their requests. The Israelites were compelled to leave their houses and lands behind them, and it was but justice that they should be able to turn these into portable property. And there was not one feeble person among their tribes&mdash;a great marvel indeed. The number of their army was very great and yet there was not one in hospital, not one carried in an ambulance, or limping in the rear. Poverty and oppression had not enfeebled them. JEHOVAH ROPHI had healed them; they carried none of the diseases of Egypt with them, and felt none of the exhaustion which sore bondage produces. When God calls his people to a long journey he fits them for it; in the pilgrimage of life our strength shall be equal to our day. See the contrast between Egypt and Israel&mdash;in Egypt one dead in every house, and among the Israelites not one so much as limping. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 38.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Egypt was glad when they departed,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> which would not have been the case had the gold and silver been borrowed by the Israelites, for men do not carry their goods into a far country. The awe of God like to see borrowers lad to nay them to be was on Egypt, and they feared his people and were glad to pay them to be gone. What a change from the time when the sons of Jacob were the drudges of the land, the offscouring of all things, the brick makers whose toil was only requited by the lash or the stick. Now they were reverenced as prophets and priests; for the fear of them fell upon them, the people proceeded even to a superstitious terror them. Thus with cheers and good wishes their former taskmasters sent them on their way: Pharaoh was foiled and the chosen people were once more on the move, journeying to the place which the Lord had given to them by a covenant of salt. &quot;O give thanks unto Jehovah; call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 39.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He spread a cloud for a covering.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Never people were so favoured. What would not travellers in the desert now give for such a canopy? The sun could not scorch them with its burning ray; their whole camp was screened like a king in his pavilion. Nothing seemed to be too good for God to give his chosen nation, their comfort was studied in every way. And fire to give light in the night. While cities were swathed in darkness, their town of tents enjoyed a light which modern art with all its appliances cannot equal. God himself was their sun and shield, their glory and their defence. Could they be unbelieving while so graciously shaded, or rebellious while they walked at midnight in such a light? Alas, the tale of their sin is as extraordinary as this story of His love; but this Psalm selects the happier theme and dwells only upon covenant love and faithfulness. O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good. We, too, have found the Lord all this to us, for he has been our sun and shield, and has preserved us alike from the perils of joys and the evils of grief; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&quot;He hath been my joy in woe,<br/>Cheered my heart when it was low;<br/>And with warnings softly sad<br/>Calmed my heart when it was glad.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">So has the promise been fulfilled to us, &quot;the sun shall not hurt thee by day, nor the moon by night.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 40.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The people asked.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> But how badly, how wickedly! And yet his grace forgave the sin of their murmuring and heard its meaning: or perhaps we may consider that while the multitude murmured there were a few, who were really gracious people, who prayed, and therefore the blessing came. He brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. He gave them what they asked amiss as well as what was good for them, mingling judgment with goodness, for their discipline. The quails were more a curse than a blessing in the end, because of their greed and lust, but in themselves they were a peculiar indulgence, and favour: it was their own fault, that the dainty meat brought death with it. As for the manna it was unmingled good to them, and really satisfied them, which the quails never did. It was bread from heaven, and the bread of heaven, sent by heaven; it was a pity that they were not led to look up to heaven whence it came, and fear and love the God who out of heaven rained it upon them. Thus they were housed beneath the Lord&#39;s canopy and fed with food from his own table; never people were so lodged and boarded. O house of Israel, praise ye the Lord. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 41.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> With Moses&#39; rod and his own word he cleft the rock in the desert, and forth leaped abundant floods for their drinking where they had feared to die of thirst. From most unlikely sources the all sufficient God can supply his people&#39;s needs; hard rocks become springing fountains at the Lord&#39;s command. They ran in the dry places like a river: so that those at a distance from the rock could stoop down and refresh themselves, and the stream flowed on, so that in future journeyings they were supplied. The desert sand would naturally swallow up the streams, and yet it did not so, the refreshing river ran &quot;in the dry places.&quot; We know that the rock set forth our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom there flows a fountain of living waters which shall never be exhausted till the last pilgrim has crossed the Jordan and entered Canaan. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 42.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">servant.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Here is the secret reason for all this grace.

In our case the Lord&#39;s eye is upon his beloved Son, and his engagements with him.

And they inherited the labour of the people, they dwelt in houses which they had not built, and gathered fruit front vines and olives which they had not planted.

Here is the nearness and the dearness of the saints unto God. They are dearer to him than kings and states, simply considered; that is, otherwise than as they in their persons are also saints; for you see that for their sakes he reproved kings, and so sheweth that he prefers them to kings. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2. Here is the great danger to kings and states, to deal with his saints otherwise than well. Which appeareth many ways; for he doth not only in words give a charge not to touch them, but he carries it in a high way (for so God will do when he pleads their cause). Touch them not; as if he had said, Let me see if you dare so much as touch them; and it is with an intimation of the highest threatening if they should; upon your peril if you do so; for that is the scope of such a speech. And accordingly in deeds he made this good; for the text saith he suffered no man to do them wrong; not that he did altogether prevent all wrong and injuries, for they received many as they went through those lands; but at no time did lie let it go unpunished. In that sense he suffered them not. You know how he plagued Pharaoh, king of Egypt, with great plagues, and all his household, for Abraham&#39;s wife&#39;s sake, Gen. 7. And so Abimelech, king of Gerar, the Lord cometh upon him with a greatness, and his first word is in Ge 2:3, &quot;Behold, thou art but a dead man, &quot;afore he had first told him why or wherefore, though then he adds the reason; he brings him upon his knees, verse 4, bids him look to it, that he give satisfaction to Abraham, and restore his wife to him again, verse 7; and well he escaped so; and tells him also that he must be beholden to Abraham&#39;s prayers for his life. &quot;He is a prophet, &quot;saith he, &quot;and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3. The third is the care and protection which God had over them, set and amplified, 1, by the number and condition of the persons whom he defended; though </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;few men in number, &quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">that is, soon reckoned, for their power and strength a few, or very small, eivs mikron, so the Septuagint in the parallel place, 1Ch 16:19; as also, 2, by what he did for them: He suffered no man, how great soever, to do them any wrong, how small soever; not without recompense and satisfaction; not to do it, though they had a mind to it. Though the people had an ill eye at them, Ge 26:11, God causeth Abimelech to make a law on purpose; Abimelech charged all his people in Isaac&#39;s behalf, and spake in the very words of the text, &quot;He that toucheth this man or his wife shall be put to death.&quot;&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Thomas Goodwin.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 15.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Mine anointed.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had no external anointing.

They are &quot;his anointed ones, &quot;&quot;having the residue of his Spirit&quot;; they are his prophets, to whom is intrusted the word of life, that they may be witnesses in the world. To these he gives as it were a safe passport through the world. Though they have ever been but men of number, accounted as a vile thing, they are precious in his sight. They are not distinguished by external dignity, numbers and power, as Rome sets forth the marks of her communion. They are in the midst of kingdoms, but not of them. They form usually the humblest portions of most communities, and yet they receive honour from God. Despised by the world, but unto God kings and priests, ordained and anointed to reign with Christ for ever. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">W.

It was of the Divine Spirit within them. &quot;The prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, &quot;2Pe 1:21.

Joseph was delivered out of prison, and we ransomed out of the house of bondage; there was redemption.

Lastly, Joseph was clothed in glorious apparel, and adorned with golden chains, and made to ride in the second chariot of Egypt: so our last step is to be advanced to high honour, even the glory of the celestial court; &quot;This honour have all the saints, &quot; Ps 149:9. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Thomas Adams.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 17.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> In many circumstances concerning Joseph&mdash;in his being beloved of his father&mdash;in his being hated of his brethren&mdash;in his sufferings and deep abasement&mdash;in his being brought out of prison&mdash;in his advancement and exaltation&mdash;in his wisdom and prudence&mdash;in his providing for his father&#39;s family&mdash;in his free forgiveness of the injuries he had sustained from his brethren&mdash;it maybe truly said, we have Christ delineated therein, and set forth thereby, in type, figure, and representatively.

By &quot;the word of the Lord&quot; that &quot;tried him, &quot;the psalmist evidently refers to the dreams of his future destiny which were sent to Joseph from God; and in saying that they tried him &quot;until his word came, &quot;he evidently means that his faith in those promises was tested by his long imprisonment, until the day of his deliverance dawned. Consider for a moment his position, and you will see the purpose of that trial. A youth educated amidst all the quiet simplicity of the early patriarchal life, he was haunted by dream visions of a mighty destiny. Those visions were mysteriously foretelling his government in Egypt, and the blessings which his wise and just rule would confer on the land; but while unable to comprehend them, he yet believed that they were voices of the future, and promises of God. But the quietude of that shepherd life was not the preparation for the fulfilment of his promised destiny. The education that would form the man who could withstand, firmly, the temptations of Egyptian life with its cities and civilization; the education that would form the ruler whose clear eye should judge between the good and the evil, and discern the course of safety in the hour of a nation&#39;s peril&mdash;all this was not to be gained under the shadow of his father&#39;s tent; it must come through trial, and through trial arising from the very promise of God in which he believed. Hence, a great and startling change crossed his life, that seemed to forbid the fulfilment of that dream promise, and tempted him to doubt its truth. Sold into Egypt as a slave, cast into prison through his fidelity to God, the word of the Lord most powerfully tried his soul. In the gloom of that imprisonment it was most hard to believe in God&#39;s faithfulness, when his affliction had risen from his obedience; and most hard to keep the promise clearly before him, when his mighty trouble would perpetually tempt him to regard it as an idle dream. But through the temptation, he gained the strong trust which the pomp and glory of the Egyptian court would have no power to destroy; and when the word of deliverance came, the man came forth, strong through trial, to fulfil his glorious destiny of ruling Egypt in the name of God, and securing for it the blessings of heaven. Thus his trial by the word of the Lord&mdash;his temptation to doubt its truth&mdash;was a divine discipline preparing him for the fulfilment of the promise. And looking at it in this aspect, this verse presents to us a deep spiritual truth: The promises of God try man, that through the trial he may be prepared for their fulfilment. Our subject then is this: The trial of man by the promises of God. This verse suggests three great facts which exhibit the three aspects of that trial. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1. God&#39;s promises must try man. Every promise of the Lord is of necessity a trial. Now, this necessity arises from two sources; from man&#39;s secret unbelief, and from God&#39;s purposes of discipline. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(a) God&#39;s word must try man by revealing his secret unbelief. We never know our want of faith till some glorious promise rouses the soul into the attitude of belief; then the coldness and unfaithfulness of the heart are lighted up by that flash of belief, and the promise is a trial. Thus Paul with his profound insight into the facts of spiritual experience, says, &quot;The word of the Lord is sharper than a two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a </span><span class="csC382D2BB">discerner of the</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">thoughts and intents of the heart.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> In illustration of this we may observe that many promises of the Lord come to us, as they came to Joseph, like dream visions of the future. Visions come to the Christian soul, as grand and wonderful as those which came to the Hebrew youth of old; and they, too, are prophecies of what we are destined to be. There comes a time when the voice of God is more clearly heard, and the great inheritance revealed. No dream of the night&mdash;no spirit of the dead&mdash;has visited us; but like a spirit some truth of God has entered the soul&#39;s presence chamber and summoned it to noble aspiration and Christ like endeavour. Then the earnest of the future gleams on life&#39;s horizon. The Sabbath of eternity, with all its balm and music, seems near, and rapt with its glory, we are roused to all surrendering zeal. But I appeal to your experience whether it is not true that such revelations of the promise rapidly become limes of trial. Then the mocking voice of unbelief tells us that aspiration is vain. The cold cross currents of indifference chill the fiery impulses of the heart. We are in prison like Joseph, by no material bars indeed, but by the invisible bonds of unbelief; and we find it most hard to keep the promise clear and bright, while tempted to believe that our aspirations were merely idle dreams. And there is that arousing, by the promise, of the soul&#39;s hidden unbelief, which makes every promise an inevitable trial. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(b) Again: </span><span class="csC382D2BB">God causes his promises to try nature that he may</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">accomplish his own purposes of discipline</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. It is a law of our nature that no belief in any unseen thing can ever pass into the active form of strong endeavour to attain it, until we are tempted to disbelieve it. Thus the great idea of an undiscovered land across the wastes of the Atlantic smote the soul of Columbus; but it remained a dreamy faith until by opposition and ridicule he was tempted to regard it as a dream, and then it became heroic endeavour, and the land was found. Thus with all men of genius. They stand in the front of their age, with thoughts which the world cannot understand; but those thoughts are dreams until suffering and scorn try the men, and then they are awakened into effort to realise them. Hence God leads us into circumstances in which we are tempted to doubt his promises, that by temptation he may discipline faith into power. There is a wilderness of temptation in every life, and like Christ, we are often led into it, from the solemn hour when we heard the voice, &quot;Thou art my son; &quot; but like Christ, we come forth strong, through the long, silent wrestling with temptation, to do our Father&#39;s will. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">2. God sends the Hour of Deliverance: </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;until the time that his</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">word came.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> When the discipline was perfected, Joseph came forth ready for his mission. But our deliverance does not always come in this way. Take from the Bible histories the four great methods by which God sends deliverance. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Sometimes by death.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Thus with Elijah Weariness, loneliness, failure, had wrung from by death the strong man the cry, &quot;Take away my life for I and not better than my fathers.&quot; The temptation was becoming too strong, and God sent deliverance in the chariot of fire. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Sometimes by</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> transforming </span><span class="csC382D2BB">the height of trial</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">into the height of blessing</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The three youths in Babylon had clenched their nerves for the climax of agony, when the fire became a Paradise. So, now, God makes the climax of trial the herald of spiritual blessedness. By suffering we are loosened from the bonds of time and sense; there is one near to us like the Son of God; and deliverance has come. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Sometimes by the glance of love on the</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">falling soul</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Thus with Peter. The temptation was mastering him; one glance of that eye, and he went out weeping and delivered. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Sometimes</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">by continuing the trial</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, but increasing the power to endure it. Thus with Paul. After the vision of the third heaven came &quot;the thorn in the flesh, &quot;The temptation made him cry thrice to, God; the trial remained, but here was the deliverance&quot; my grace is sufficient for thee.&quot; The suffering lost none of its pressure, but he learned to glory in infirmity; and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">then</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> came his delivering hour. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">3. God makes the Trial by Promise fulfil the Promise itself. In Joseph the temptation to doubt the word of God silently meetened him for its fulfilment. So with us all. We hope not for an Egyptian kingdom, our dream vision is of a heavenly inheritance, and the palace of a heavenly King. But every temptation resisted, every mocking voice of doubt overcome, is an aid upwards and onwards. Trials, sufferings, struggles, are angels arraying the souls in the white robes of the heavenly world, and crowning it with the crown that fadeth not away. And when the end comes, then it will be seen that the long dreary endeavour to hold fast the dream promise&mdash;the firm resolute &quot;no&quot; to the temptation to disbelieve, are all more than recompensed with &quot;the exceeding and eternal weight of glory.&quot;&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">Edward Zuscombe</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">&quot;Sermons preached at Kings Lynn.&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> 1867. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 19.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The word of the Lord tried him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> As we try God&#39;s word, so God&#39;s word tries us; and happy if, when we are tried, we come forth as gold; and the trial of our faith proves more precious than that of gold which perisheth, though it be tried with fire. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">William Jay.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Verse 19.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Tried him.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> I doubt not that Joseph&#39;s brethren were humbled, yet Joseph may be more, he must be cast into the ditch, and into the prison, and the iron must enter not only into his legs, but into his soul.

Joel speaks of the day of God&#39;s vengeance as &quot;a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness&quot; (Joe 2:2); and Zephaniah employs nearly the same language (Ps 1:15). The pillar that went before the Israelites, and gave them light, was to the Egyptians &quot;a cloud and darkness&quot; (Ex 14:20). The darkness which was upon the face of the earth &quot;in the beginning, &quot;is described by Jehovah in the book of Job as a cloud: &quot;When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it&quot; (Job 38:9). So now the land of Egypt may have been wrapped about by a thick palpable cloud, cold, damp, impenetrable: the people would feel it upon their limbs, as swaddling bands; the sun would be blotted out by it, and all things reduced almost to a state of death&mdash;of which this ninth plague was in a certain sense the shadow cast before. Such a cloud would be even more terrible in Egypt, sunny Egypt, than in other countries; for there the sky is almost always clear, and heavy rains unknown. But in any place, and under any conditions, it must have been full of horror and misery. Nothing could represent this more forcibly than the short sentence, &quot;Neither rose any from his place for three days.&quot; It was an horror of great darkness; it rested on them like a pall; they knew not what dangers might be around them, what judgment was next to happen: they had not been forewarned of this plague, and they could not tell but it might be only a prelude to some more awful visitation: their soul melted in them, for fear of those things that might come upon them: they dared not move from chamber to chamber, nor even from seat to seat: wherever they chanced to be at the moment when the darkness fell upon them, there they must remain. Pharaoh might call in vain for his guards; they could not come to him. Moses and Aaron were no longer within reach, for none could go to seek them. Masters could not command their slaves, nor slaves hasten to obey their master&#39;s call; the wife could not flee to her husband nor the child cling to its parents: the same fear was upon all, both high and low; the same paralysing terror and dismay possessed them every one. As says the patriarch Job, they &quot;laid hold on horror&quot; (Job 18:20). And this continued for three days and nights: they had no lamps nor torches; either they could not kindle them, or they dared not move to procure them: they were silent in darkness, like men already dead. Hope and expectation of returning light might at first support them; but hope delayed through seventy-two weary hours would presently die out, and leave them to despair. The darkness would become more oppressive and intolerable the longer it continued; &quot;felt&quot; upon their bodies as a physical infliction, and &quot;felt&quot; even more in their souls in agonies of fear and apprehension; such a darkness as that which, in the book of Revelation, the fifth angel pours out upon the seat of the beast&mdash;&quot;Whose kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds&quot; (Re 16:10,11). If there be any truth in the traditions of the Jews on this subject, there were yet greater alarms under this canopy of darkness, this palpable obscurity, than any which would arise out of the physical infliction. Darkness is a type of Satan&#39;s kingdom; and Satan had some liberty in Egypt to walk up and down upon the land, and to go to and fro in it. The Jewish Rabbis tell us that the devil and his angels were let loose during these three dreadful days; that they had a wider range and greater liberty than usual for working mischief. They describe these evil spirits going among the wretched people, glued to their scats as they were, with terror; frightening them with fearful apparitions; piercing their ears with hideous shrieks and groans; driving them almost to madness with the intensity of their fears; making their flesh creep, and the hair of their head to stand on end. Such a climax seems to be referred to by the Psalmist, &quot;He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them&quot; (Ps 78:40). </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Thomas S.

The Nile, according to Pliny, was the &quot;only source from whence the Egyptians obtained water for drinking&quot; (Hist. Nat. 76, c. 33). This water was considered particularly sweet and refreshing; so much so that the people were in the habit of provoking thirst in order that they might partake more freely of its soft and pleasant draughts.

The quantity of fish in Egypt was a very great boon to the poor classes, and when the Nile overflowed the country inhabitants of the inland villages benefited by this annual gift of the river, as the land did by the fertilizing mud deposited upon it. The canals, ponds, and pools, on the low lands, continued to abound in fish, even after the inundation had ceased; and it was then that their return to the Nile was intercepted by closing the mouths of the canals. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Sir J.

The Nile, its branches, and the great canals of irrigation are all bank full, and the exuberant moisture has aroused from their summer torpor, into life and activity, the frogs of the Nile, in numbers inconceivable to those who have not been in hot countries. Even in ordinary years the annoyance of these loathsome creatures night and day, gives some idea of what this plague must have been, and renders abundantly reasonable the creation of a goddess, Ranipula, {1} at the very commencement of the mythology of ancient Egypt.

Even the gods, the oxen, and goats, and cats, were defiled with the vermin. The Egyptians not only writhed under the loathsome scourge, but felt themselves humbled and disgraced by it. Josephus notices this:&mdash;&quot;Pharaoh, &quot;he says, &quot;was so confounded at this new plague, that, what with the danger, the scandal, and the nastiness of it, he was half sorry for what he had done&quot; (b. it. c. 14). The plague assumed the form of a disease, being &quot;in the people.&quot; Ex 8:17. As Josephus says again, &quot;The bodies of the people bred them, and they were all covered over with them, gnawing and tearing intolerably, and no remedy, for baths and ointments did no good.&quot; But, however distressing to their bodies, the foul and disgraceful character of the plague, and the offence brought upon their religion by the defilement of their deities and the interruption of all their religious ceremonies, was its most offensive feature. </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Thomas S.
