Christianity...does not promote sects and sectarianism; but unity and brotherhood, love, peace, and quietness.does not promote selfishness, worldliness, indulgence, extravagance, wealth, injustice, or disorderliness. It promotes care and concern, ministry and help, giving and justice, government and obedience to law.</span></p><p class="cs9CB010B4"><span class="csC05134DD">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Charge 3: he was a profaner of the temple.

A leopard&#39;s spots cannot be changed and a fool will remain a fool, as Solomon well knew from bitter personal experience.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">One of the greatest fools mentioned in Scripture is Esau, Jacob&#39;s twin brother. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">Esau was born into a family with every earthly and heavenly advantage. </span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">God had sovereignly decreed that Jacob would receive the birthright and the blessing, but Esau was still left with enormous advantages over the rest of mankind. His father was Isaac. His grandfather was Abraham. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Heb 11:10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">But Esau lacked spiritual vision and went by vain imaginations. He had no eye for the unseen, the spiritual, and the eternal. He had no interest in those &quot;exceeding great and precious promises&quot; that God had given to Abraham and confirmed to Isaac and his seed</span></p><p class="csAED485B0"><span class="csA521DC07">Though Esau was born with so many advantages he became a fool. He was born in the home of believers, but failed to benefit from that advantage.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Esau quickly developed a love for this world. He became a skilled hunter. He had an eye like a hawk, he could move through tall grass like a leopard, and his arrow never missed. He was bold, brave, rugged, hairy, and sunburned, but he was a heathen. A little boy in a big body; full body and empty soul... a profane person, who failed of the grace of God.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Esau&#39;s preoccupation with this world blinded him to the world to come. So he sold his birthright, which was never his to sell, then wept bitter tears when Jacob stole what really was already his: the undiluted blessing of God. The pestle and mortar were busy enough that day. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Ge 27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Esau &quot;cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry,&quot; But Esau was a fool and soon forgot and wandered away from what he had been taught.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Pr 27:8 &para; As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">He wandered away from the old homestead to find more agreeable friends among the vile Canaanites. In many a home Esau was welcome because of his venison or fresh-caught fish and because of his hunting stories and tales. </span></p><p class="cs44694EDE"><span class="csA521DC07">Esau, was a true Canaanite at heart. Son of Isaac and Rebekah, and grandson of Abraham and Sarah, as he was, Esau had nothing of his forefathers or his foremothers in him, but the dregs of their remaining vices. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">What a shock and disappointment it must have been to Isaac and Rebekah to learn that Esau was going to marry two Hittite women.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Ge 26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife </span><span class="csF42C4B08">Judith</span><span class="csA521DC07"> the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and </span><span class="csF42C4B08">Bashemath</span><span class="csA521DC07"> the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF42C4B08">Judith </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csF42C4B08">Bashemath</span><span class="csA521DC07"> </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">These godless marriages &quot;were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah&quot; </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">two raw pagans in their covenantal camp. Isaac and Rebekah&#39;s disapproval put the pestle and mortar to work again, but Esau was too big a fool to profit much from his mistake and its consequences.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">One day Esau overheard his mother say to his father: &quot;I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth:</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Ge 27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Esau saw Jacob leave home to seek a wife among his mother&#39;s people in Mesopotamia. </span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">Esau saw that his marriages had broken his parents&#39; hearts. </span></p><p class="cs30664B8A"><span class="csA521DC07">Ge 28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;</span></p><p class="cs30664B8A"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram;</span></p><p class="cs30664B8A"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; </span></p><p class="cs30664B8A"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;9 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham&#39;s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. </span></p><p class="cs30664B8A"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs30664B8A"><span class="csA521DC07">The thought never occurred to Esau that Ishmael was as pagan as the Canaanites and that a marriage to a daughter of Ishmael would no more please his parents than his marriages to Judith and Bashemath.</span></p><p class="cs30664B8A"><span class="csA521DC07">Esau bdid this with a sincere desire to obey and please his parents. &nbsp;Having heard the pious advice which Isaac gave to Jacob, he therefore went and took a wife from the family of his grandfather Abraham, as Jacob was desired to do out of the family of his maternal uncle Laban. &nbsp;Mahalath, whom he took to wife, stood in the same degree of relationship to Isaac his father as Rachel did to his mother Rebekah. &nbsp;Esau married his father&#39;s niece; Jacob married his mother&#39;s niece. &nbsp;It was obviously to please his parents that Esau took this additional wife. &nbsp;It is supposed that Ishmael must have been dead thirteen or fourteen years before this time, and that going to Ishmael signifies only going to the family of Ishmael. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs30664B8A"><span class="csA521DC07">Isaac was now about one hundred and thirty-six or one hundred and thirty-seven years of age, and Jacob seventy-seven, and as Ishmael died in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of his age, which according to the scripture was the one hundred and twenty-third of Isaac, then Ishmael must have been dead about fourteen years.</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="csA521DC07">After that there was no more pestle and mortar. The fool was left to his folly. But other fools might have thought that Esau was a sensible fellow. After all, he got on well in this world. He settled in mount Seir and became the patriarch of the formidable Edomite race. One of his grandsons, Amalek, founded another nation that was bitterly hostile to Israel. And the Edomite race spawned Herod the Great, the infamous ruler who massacred the babes of Bethlehem in an attempt to murder the infant Christ of God.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/></span></p></body>
