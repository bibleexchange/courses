This, in fact, became Tyndale&#39;s life passion, aptly summed up in the words of his mentor, Erasmus: &quot;Christ desires his mysteries to be published abroad as widely as possible. I would that [the Gospels and the epistles of Paul] were translated into all languages, of all Christian people, and that they might be read and known.&quot;</span></p><table class="cs2D2816FE" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="200" align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse;">

		<p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">He was a native of Gloucester and began his studies at Oxford in 1510, later moving on to Cambridge. By 1523 his passion had been ignited; in that year he sought permission and funds from the bishop of London to translate the New Testament. The bishop denied his request, and further queries convinced Tyndale the project would not be welcomed anywhere in England.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">To find a hospitable environment, he traveled to the free cities of Europe&mdash;Hamburg, Wittenberg, Cologne, and finally to the Lutheran city of Worms. There, in 1525, his New Testament emerged: the first translation from Greek into the English language. It was quickly smuggled into England, where it received a less-than-enthusiastic response from the authorities. King Henry VIII, Cardinal Wolsey, and Sir Thomas More, among others, were furious. It was, said More, &quot;not worthy to be called Christ&#39;s testament, but either Tyndale&#39;s own testament or the testament of his master Antichrist.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">Authorities bought up copies of the translation (which, ironically, only financed Tyndale&#39;s further work) and hatched plans to silence Tyndale.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">Meanwhile Tyndale had moved to Antwerp, a city in which he was relatively free from both English agents and those of the Holy Roman (and Catholic) Empire. For nine years he managed with the help of friends to evade authorities, revise his New Testament, and begin translating the Old.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">His translations, it would turn out, became decisive in the history of the English Bible, and of the English language. Nearly a century later, when translators of the Authorized, or King James Version, debated how to translate the original languages, eight of ten times, they agreed that Tyndale had it best to begin with.</span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csCD23F8B5">Betrayal</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">During these years, Tyndale also gave himself methodically to good works because, as he said, &quot;My part be not in Christ if mine heart be not to follow and live according as I teach.&quot; On Mondays he visited other religious refugees from England. On Saturdays he walked Antwerp&#39;s streets, seeking to minister to the poor. On Sundays he dined in merchants&#39; homes, reading Scripture before and after dinner. The rest of the week he devoted to writing tracts and books and translating the Bible.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">We do not know who planned and financed the plot that ended his life (whether English or continental authorities), but we do know it was carried out by Henry Phillips, a man who had been accused of robbing his father and of gambling himself into poverty. Phillips became Tyndale&#39;s guest at meals and soon was one of the few privileged to look at Tyndale&#39;s books and papers.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">In May 1535, Phillips lured Tyndale away from the safety of his quarters and into the arms of soldiers. Tyndale was immediately taken to the Castle of Vilvorde, the great state prison of the Low Countries, and accused of heresy.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">Trials for heresy in the Netherlands were in the hands of special commissioners of the Holy Roman Empire. It took months for the law to take its course. During this time, Tyndale had many hours to reflect on his own teachings, such as this passage from one of his tracts:</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">&quot;Let it not make thee despair, neither yet discourage thee, O reader, that it is forbidden thee in pain of life and goods, or that it is made breaking of the king&#39;s peace, or treason unto his highness, to read the Word of thy soul&#39;s health&mdash;for if God be on our side, what matter maketh it who be against us, be they bishops, cardinals, popes.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">Finally, in early August 1536, Tyndale was condemned as a heretic, degraded from the priesthood, and delivered to the secular authorities for punishment.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">On Friday, October 6, after local officials took their seats, Tyndale was brought to the cross in the middle of the town square and given a chance to recant. That refused, he was given a moment to pray. English historian John Foxe said he cried out, &quot;Lord, open the King of England&#39;s eyes!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">Then he was bound to the beam, and both an iron chain and a rope were put around his neck. Gunpowder was added to the brush and logs. At the signal of a local official, the executioner, standing behind Tyndale, quickly tightened the noose, strangling him. Then an official took up a lighted torch and handed it to the executioner, who set the wood ablaze.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">One other brief report of that distant scene has come down to us. It is found in a letter from an English agent to Lord Cromwell two months later.</span></p><p class="cs35586"><span class="cs15323895">&quot;They speak much,&quot; he wrote, &quot;of the patient sufferance of Master Tyndale at the time of his execution.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs778DBFE2"><span class="cs15323895">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA521DC07">Patrick Hamilton Pioneer of Reformation</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">(1504 &ndash; February 29, 1528) was a <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland"><span class="csB2A6C030">Scottish</span></a></span><span class="csA7555675"> churchman and an early Protestant <a class="csF61EF4EB" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation"><span class="csB2A6C030">Reformer</span></a></span><span class="csA7555675"> in Scotland.

		<p class="cs309987F"><span class="cs1B2EF427">Progressively, people began to respect the truth displayed in Wycliffe&#39;s life, yet his enemies still raged fiercely against him. He was honored nationwide. Feeling threatened, the pope and his supporters were greatly upset by his works. In 1377, John Wycliffe was called before the Bishop of London. Two of Wycliffe&#39;s influential friends traveled with him to the hearing. Soon, the bishop began arguing with one of Wycliffe&#39;s friends and the chaotic situation soon forced the trial to be closed. One year later, in April of 1378, Wycliffe was called to another trial. Yet, God&#39;s hand was upon His servant, for in the middle if the trial, a message from the queen mother was delivered, stating that Wycliffe should not be harmed, and the trial was closed. </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="cs1B2EF427">It was shortly thereafter that John Wycliffe became very ill. Wishful friars, hoping to hear some death-bed recanting of his beliefs, hurriedly arrived at his bedside, only to hear the bold words of faith &quot;I shall not die, but live, and declare the evil deeds of the friars.&quot; This statement proved to be true, and Wycliffe was restored to health. </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="cs1B2EF427">The third trial arrived in 1382, and again Wycliffe was appearing before the Bishop of London. Perhaps God was angry that men would again try to harm his servant, because this time, He caused the earth to shake. Despite the fact that Wycliffe was condemned at this trial, god&#39;s mighty hand had been displayed, and Wycliffe was not harmed for the rest of his life. </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csB1C3C0FA">As time passed, Wycliffe made the decision to return to his home and live the rest of his life quietly shining a light to the next generation. Though he was aged, his influence did not end. Wycliffe himself worked on translating and overseeing the translation of the first English Bible in 1,000 years. He also trained men to share the gospel and instructed them in the truths of scripture. These followers of Wycliffe who continued his legacy of living with the Word of God as ultimate truth were known as the Lollards. They came to twelve basic conclusions including subject matter such as the state of the church, the priesthood, transubstantiation, prayers for the dead, pilgrimages, and confessions. What really separated Wycliffe and the Lollards from the general population of the time was their faithfulness to the Bible, and their belief that it was the absolute truth. </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csB1C3C0FA">Wycliffe lived many years before the period we now know as the Reformation began with men such as <a class="cs1B4AC004" href="http://www.hyperhistory.net/apwh/bios/b2mluther_p1ij.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">Martin Luther </span></a></span><span class="csB1C3C0FA">or <a class="cs1B4AC004" href="http://www.hyperhistory.net/apwh/bios/b2calvinj.htm"><span class="cs92015F65">John Calvin</span></a></span><span class="csB1C3C0FA">. Although we do not think of the Reformation beginning in the 1300s, it truly did. Though he lived many years before the reformation period, John Wycliffe, a &quot;man ahead of his time&quot;, truly was the &quot;Morning Star of the Reformation.&quot; </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="csB1C3C0FA">In 1384, Wycliffe suffered from his second or third stroke and went to be with his Lord. Death did not silence his influence, however. In fact, he had caused such disturbance in the minds and hearts of those who most hated him, that thirty years after his departure, he was officially condemned by the church for a second time. Instructions were given for his bones to be dug up and burnt as well as his writings, and finally, his ashes thrown into the river. Throwing his ashes into the river turned out to be quite an ironic act, as William Wordsworth explains in his poem on the subject:</span></p><p class="cs82B48371"><span class="csAAD03ED1"><br/>Wycliffe is disinhumed<br/>Yea his dry bones to ashes are consumed <br/>And flung into the brook which travels near<br/>[.]Into the Avon-Avon to the[.]<br/>main ocean they- this deed accursed<br/>An emblem yields to friends and enemies<br/>How the bold Teacher&#39;s Doctrine sanctified<br/>By truth, shall throughout the world dispersed. </span></p><p class="cs309987F"><span class="cs1B2EF427">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="cs4CEB16C3">
