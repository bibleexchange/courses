In blind flying, a pilot is deprived of visual references and he also loses his ability to distinguish between the usual forces of gravity and the &quot;g-forces&quot; of turning, diving, or climbing. Instrument flying is based on the principle that the pilot must have an accurate standard of reference outside of himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must obey it whether he feels like it or not. </span></p><p class="csC540B806"><span class="csA521DC07">Have trust in the instruments and the instruments bring you safely through the clouds, the fog, and the darkness to a pinpoint landing on an airstrip at your destination.</span></p><p class="csC540B806"><span class="csA521DC07">The modern man has decided he needs no outside standard of reference. He has given birth to a permissive society which has no absolute standards of right and wrong. Everybody does his own thing. As a result homes are breaking up at an alarming rate; children in school experiment with dangerous drugs; men and women live promiscuously, ignoring the inevitable consequences of divine judgment; the most horrible forms of perversion are allowed to express themselves openly; pornography is allowed to propagate itself; crime goes very largely unpunished.</span></p><p class="csC540B806"><span class="csA521DC07">The arguments of those who espouse these things sound reasonable but that is only because society has abandoned the objective standards God has provided. </span></p><p class="csC540B806"><span class="csA521DC07">There </span><span class="csD3860DFD">are</span><span class="csA521DC07"> absolutes of morality.

One light year is six trillion miles.</span></p><p class="csC540B806"><span class="csA521DC07">This discovery of an expanding universe has upset the old theory of a steady-state universe&mdash;one in which the universe was believed to have been eternal and without beginning.
