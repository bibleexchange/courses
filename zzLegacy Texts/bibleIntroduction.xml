<text id='' class='h2'><eng>Course Description</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>As we are giving an overview of the Bible&#44; we will mainly consider general facts concerning the Scriptures. Much more time and study will be given in other courses to dig into the wealth and depth of Scripture. Because there is not &quot;one size fits all&quot; when it comes to teaching&#44; each Bible Student will find they already know some things and other things never heard. Even the things heard&#44; maybe you have forgotten and this course will serve as a good review for you that are somewhat familiar with the Bible and will serve as an introduction for those of you who are not so familiar. No matter what your familiarity with Scripture&#44; I am sure you can glean from information given in this study.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>Bible Introduction is an introduction to the Holy Bible and to why we believe it is the infallible&#44; inerrant&#44; unadulterated&#44; and inspired Word of God and free from contradictions.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h2'><eng>Overview of Course</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>Bible Introduction will include the study of:</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Chapter 1: General Information of the Bible</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The sixty-six books of the Bible and their general contents&#44; principal characters&#44; places&#44; facts and events of the Bible.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Chapter 2: Unity &amp; Inspiration of the Bible</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The awesome and beautiful design of Scripture and the process by which God chose to deliver his message through the pens of holy men.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Chapter 3: Canonization of the Bible</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>Answer the question&#44; &quot;How did we settle on the 66 books we call the Bible? Why are other old manuscripts not included in the Biblical canon and why are the Books that are included there?&quot; </eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Chapter 4: God&apos;s Word Into English</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The amazing history of how God has preserved his Word through the ancient languages and then oversaw its translation into English.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Chapter 5: Modern Versions of the Bible</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>A careful look at Modern Versions of the Bible with important concerns and cautions.</eng> <swa/></text>

<text id='' class='h1'><eng>The Bible Is&hellip; &amp; Names of the Bible</eng> <swa/></text> <video id='bi_intro' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/iGYWRgGjhyE' /> 
<text id='' class='h2'><eng>The Bible Is&hellip;</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>The Bible is God&apos;s written Revelation of His will to men. </eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>God wrote no other book than the Bible. There is no other physical evidence of the details of God&apos;s will and His person than the Bible. Only by reading the Bible can we be sure of so many questions regarding God.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>Who is God?</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>What is God like?</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>What does God want?</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>What is God&apos;s plan?</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>Why does God do what He does?&#44; Etc.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>In the Bible&#44; God has provided the details of His will and the expression of His love for humanity. All other supposed revelation must harmonize with this great Book. The Holy Bible is the standard for all life--temporal and eternal!</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>The Bible is all about Salvation through Jesus Christ.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The Bible&apos;s central theme is salvation through Jesus Christ. (&quot;central&quot; main&#44; chief&#44; basic theme - a topic&#44; as of a lecture.) </eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>The Bible is Translated Today from Much Older Languages</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew (with a small percentage in Aramaic.) The New Testament was originally written in Greek. The English King James Version is a translation from these original languages. To &quot;translate&quot; means to change from one language to another.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>The Bible is ONE</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The Bible is one book&#44; one history&#44; and one story--HIS STORY [God&apos;s Story]! We call it the HOLY Bible because it is God&apos;s Word and not merely the story of men. The word HOLY means sacred&#44; pure&#44; blameless&#44; or religious&#44; consecrated. The Bible is a divine book yet God used people to express His Divine truths. Holy men (human element) wrote as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost (Divine element). Because it is God&apos;s Word&#44; we cannot dispose of one book or passage of the Bible.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The Bible has 66 books&#44; 39 in the OT and 27 in the NT. The Divine revelation of the Bible moves smoothly from the beginning in Genesis to its ending in Revelation. Genesis is a book of origins; Revelation is a book of endings. The books of the Bible in-between are God&apos;s redeeming words to a wrecked&#44; ruined world. Each book of the Bible has its own message&#44; yet in its entirety a complete message of salvation to man can be seen.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h2'><eng>Names of the Bible</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Holy Bible</eng> <swa/></text>The actual word bible appears nowhere within the text of the Bible. The word bible comes to us from the Greek word biblios which means &quot;books&quot;. The word biblios was originally used to refer to the papyrus reed used in the making of ancient paper. The English word bible means &quot;books&quot;. The Holy Bible refers to the collection of Holy books. 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>The Bible&apos;s Names for Itself</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>The Book</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>Genesis 5:1--This is the book of the generations of Adam.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>Psalm 40:7--Then said I&#44; Lo&#44; I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me&#44; (Heb. 10:7)</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>Matthew 1:1--The book of the generation of Jesus Christ&#44; the son of David&#44; the son of Abraham.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>Luke 4:17--And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book&#44; he found the place where it was written&#44; </eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>Testament</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The word testament means covenant or agreement. The Bible books under the old covenant are called the Old Testament and the Bible books under the new covenant are called the New Testament.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>II Corinthians 3:14--But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>II Corinthians 3:6--;Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter&#44; but of the spirit: for the letter killeth&#44; but the spirit giveth life.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>Scripture</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The word scripture means &quot;writings&quot;. This word is used to refer to sacred writings&#44; and is usually used in connection with the Bible. Jesus refers to the writings of the prophet Isaiah as the Scripture (Lk. 4:21). Jesus questions the chief priests and elders: &quot;Did ye never read in the Scriptures&#8230;&quot; (Mt. 21:42) Jesus again used this word when talking to the Sadducces: &quot;Ye do err&#44; not knowing the scriptures&#44; nor the power of God&quot;. (Mt. 22:29) Other references: Lk. 24:27&#44; Rom. 1:2&#44; Rom. 15:4&#44; II Tim. 3:15-16; I Peter 1:20</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>The Word of God</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>This is the most significant&#44; powerful&#44; and complete name for the Holy Bible. The Bible is the God&apos;s written and recorded word to man. The Bible is not the word of man. The Bible is the Word of God. References: Mk. 7:13&#44; Rom. 10:17&#44; II Cor. 2:17.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>Hebrews 4:12--;For the word of God is quick&#44; and powerful&#44; and sharper than any twoedged sword&#44; piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit&#44; and of the joints and marrow&#44; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</eng> <swa/></text> </div> <div class='chapter' id='s1c4'>

<text id='' class='h2'><eng>OLD TESTAMENT &amp; NEW TESTAMENT: COMPARED</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Both begin with Divinity.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>The Old Testament begins with God. -- Genesis 1:1</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>The New Testament begins with Christ. -- Matthew 1:1</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Both share the same theme.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>Salvation through Jesus Christ is the central theme of both Testaments.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>Romans 1:16; I Peter 1:10; Isaiah 56:1; 59:17</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>The Old Testament looks forward by faith to the cross. Redemption through the blood of Jesus was God&apos;s plan for the Old Testament&#44; and is God&apos;s plan for the New Testament.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>Revelation 13:8--And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him&#44; whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='p'><eng>The plan of God since the beginning of time was for Jesus who is the Lamb of God to shed His Divine Blood to purchase our salvation.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>The New Testament looks back at the finished work of the cross.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Both center on Christ.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h4'><eng>The Old Testament is full of prophecies of Christ. These are called Messianic Prophecies. The Old Testament contains many shadows and types that point to Christ. The law is a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. -- Gal. 3:24 Christ is the fulfilling of the law. (Galatians 3:24; Romans 10:4)</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>Matthew 5:17--Think not that I am come to destroy the law&#44; or the prophets: I am not come to destroy&#44; but to fulfil.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h5'><eng>Christ is the predominant person of the New Testament. Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant. -- Heb. 12:24 (Heb. 8:6; 9:15)</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h2'><eng>OLD TESTAMENT &amp; NEW TESTAMENT: CATEGORIZED</eng> <swa/></text> <image id='book_shelf' class='' alt='bookShelf' src='images/bookShelf.gif' /> </div><div class='chapter' id='s1c5'> 
<text id='' class='h1'><eng>The Purpose of the Bible</eng> <swa/></text> <video id='bi_intro' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/66msO0OyYfo' />
<text id='' class='h2'><eng>The Bible was written that men might believe&#44; understand&#44; know&#44; love&#44; and follow Christ.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>That men might believe that Jesus is the Christ. The main theme of the Bible is redemption through Jesus Christ. The word christ means &quot;the anointed one&quot;&#44; and refers to the Messiah. Men need to believe that Jesus is the Savior. The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes. (Rom. 1:16)</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>John 20:31--But these are written&#44; that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ&#44; the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>That men might understand who Christ is. Jesus reveals Himself through His Word. The Bible tells us that the Scriptures testify of Jesus. Men need to understand through the Word that Jesus is the messiah; He is the savior and the only source of Salvation.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>John 5:39--Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>That men might know Christ. The Bible helps men to know Christ. The songwriter stated&#44; &quot;I&apos;m glad I know who Jesus is!&quot; Paul desired to know Christ in a greater way. Christians can know who Jesus is&#44; and also know Him in a personal way sharing fellowship with Him.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>John 17:3--And this is life eternal&#44; that they might know thee the only true God&#44; and Jesus Christ&#44; whom thou hast sent.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>That men might love Christ. According to the Scripture&#44; in order for a man to love Christ he must keep the Words of Christ which are contained in the Bible. We need to study the Bible so that we can obey the Word of God and love Jesus.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>John 14:23--&#8230;a man love me&#44; he will keep my words: and my Father will love him&#8230;</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>I John 2:5--But whoso keepeth his word&#44; in him verily is the love of God perfected&#8230;</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>That men might follow Christ. The word Christian means &quot;one who follows Christ.&quot; The Bible was written that men might follow Christ.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>John 10:27--My sheep hear my voice&#44; and I know them&#44; and they follow me:</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>John 12:26--If any man serve me&#44; let him follow me&#8230;</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h2'><eng>The Bible reveals the purpose and plan of God.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Concerning Salvation. The Bible explains that salvation is received through faith in Jesus and reveals man&apos;s need of salvation.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>John 3:16--For God so loved the world&#44; that he gave his only begotten Son&#44; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish&#44; but have everlasting life.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Concerning the Church. The plan of God for His Church is that she should be glorious&#44; holy and without blemish. There is much instruction given to the Church in the Bible. </eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>Ephesians 5:27--That he might present it to himself a glorious church&#44; not having spot&#44; or wrinkle&#44; or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>Concerning the last days. The Bible reveals God&apos;s plan for the last days. We understand from the Bible that we are living in the last days and God gave us warning of what would come to pass in these last days.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>II Timothy 3:1--This know also&#44; that in the last days perilous times shall come.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h2'><eng>The Bible is God&apos;s written Word to man.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>1. It is a sure Word of prophecy. The Bible is the infallible Word of God. It does not merely contain God&apos;s Word&#44; but is God&apos;s Word. The Bible is a sure word in a dark hour.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>II Peter 1:19-21--For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; where unto ye do well that ye take heed&#44; as unto a light that shineth in a dark place&#44; until the day dawn&#44; and the day star arise in your hearts: 20 Knowing this first&#44; that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>It is a solid foundation. (I Cor. 3:11) The Word of God is a solid foundation of our faith. Jesus is the Rock of our salvation. Jesus is the Word that became flesh. When everything else is sinking; the Word of God will not fail.</eng><swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='blockquote'><eng>I Corinthian 3:11--For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid&#44; which is Jesus Christ.</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text id='' class='h3'><eng>It is the infallible&#44; inspired Word of God. The word inspiration means &quot;God breathed.&quot; There is life in the Word which is the very breath of God. God&apos;s Word is without error or contradiction.</eng> <swa/></text>

	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>Perfect Unity of the Bible: Redemption</eng> <swa/></text>

<text class='p'>Redemption is the one main theme of the Bible. </text> 	
<text class='h2'>Redemption is the action of purchasing or paying in full.</text> 	
<text class='p'>Man has been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ. Jesus has paid the price in full with His shed blood upon the cross for the salvation of man. Salvation through the blood of Jesus is the main theme of the Bible. This theme can be found from Genesis to Revelation. The first promise of redemption is given in Gen. 3:15.</text> 
<text class='blockquote'>Genesis 3:15--And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</text> 	
<text class='p'>This is a prophecy that The Messiah who would come from the seed of the woman would one day bruise the head of the serpent. The theme continues to the Book of Revelation.</text> 	
<text class='blockquote'>Revelation 5:9--And they sung a new song,saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred,and tongue, and people, and nation; </text> 	
<text class='p'>This Scripture refers to the resurrected Christ who redeemed us by his blood.</text> 	
<text class='h2'>Christ the Redeemer is the main Person of the Bible.</text> 	
<text class='p'>The blood sacrifices in the OT were a type of Jesus who is the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world. <i>&quot;Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and</i> blessing.&quot; (Rev. 5:12) The OT looks forward by faith to the cross of Christ. The Gospels portray Christ and His death upon the cross. The NT looks back upon the finished work of the cross.</text> 	

<text class='p'>Christ manifests Himself in the OT at different times in various ways. Christ is portrayed in type and in prophecy as the coming Messiah. </text>

<text class='h3'>From Adam to Abraham we see the beginning of the human race. &#13;&#10;</text>
<text class='p'>Genesis 1:26, 27; 4:1; 5:1-5, 32; 6:9,10; 7:17-23; 9:1; 11:10, 27 &#13;&#10;</text>

<text class='h3'>From Abraham to Christ we see the beginning of a chosen race. &#13;&#10;The Hebrew nation. &#13;&#10;</text>
<text class='p'>Genesis 12:1, 2; 22:15-18; 32:9-12; Joshua 1:1-3; Matthew 1:1,2, 16 &#13;&#10;</text>

	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>Perfect Unity of the Bible: The Bible is One</eng> <swa/></text> 

<text class='h2'>The Bible is without contradiction.</text> 	
<text class='p'>There is no error in the Bible. The Bible is the infallible Word ofGod. God&apos;s Word is without error or contradiction. The Bible is accurate and complete. The Bible is historically and scientifically accurate. There is no contradiction between true science and the Bible. True historical record andArcheological record are in complete agreement with the Bible.</text> 	
<text class='p'>There is complete harmony in the Bible itself. What has been written in one part of the Bible will be in agreement with what has been written in another part of the Bible. There is total unity within the Bible itself.</text> 	

<text class='h2'>The Bible is One in Prophecy</text> 	
<text class='p'>The OT contains much prophecy. Prophecy is a declaration of something to come. It is history written in advance. All of these prophecies are in agreement with each other. Some of the OT prophesies have been fulfilled at a later date within the OT. Many OT prophesies were describing the coming of theMessiah. </text> 	
<text class='p'>The NT fulfils much of the OT prophesy. The prophecies are fulfilled in great detail confirming their accuracy. The prophetic note in every book is consistent with that in all the others. </text> 	

<text class='h2'>The Bible is One in Doctrine</text> 	
<text class='p'>Doctrine is the fundamental truths of the Bible arranged in systematic form. The truths of the Bible remain the same throughout the Word of God. There is perfect unity of Doctrine in the Bible. This unity is carried through from the Old to the New Testament. The Bible is the complete written revelation to man with perfect harmony of every doctrine and truth.</text> 	
<text class='p'>The Bible is a perfect union of truth. Truth does not change. Webster&apos;s Dictionary defines truth as : 	<i>Conformity to fact or reality;</i> 	<i>&quot;exact accordance with that which is, or has been, or shall be.&quot;</i> 	The Bible truths remain the same from Genesis to Revelation. </text> 	
<text class='blockquote'>John 17:17--Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</text> 	

<text class='h2'>The Bible is One in Purpose.</text> 	
<text class='p'>The purpose of the Bible is to reveal God&apos;s will to man. The Bible reveals God&apos;s plan throughout the ages. The Word gives instruction and guidance to the souls of men. The plan of redemption is revealed to man in the Bible. </text> 	
<text class='p'>Each Book of the Bible heralds the one purpose of the Bible. God has revealed His will to different people at different times throughout the Bible.The entire Bible directs men to Christ and the plan of redemption which is the central theme of the Bible.</text> 	

<text class='h2'>The Bible is One in Structure.</text> 		
<text class='p'>Each Testament is composed of three main divisions -- history,instruction, and prophecy.</text> 	
<text class='p'>There is but one Bible composed of both New and Old Testaments.</text> 	

<text class='p'>The New is in the Old contained; the Old is by the New explained; <br />The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is by the New revealed; <br />The New is in the Old foreshown; the Old is in the New full-grown.</text>

<text class='p'>All of this intricate complexity of the Bible in content and design, with its cohesion, unanimity, and mutual confirmation, would be remarkable and impressive enough had it been achieved by a group of scholars working in close collaboration with constant interchange of information and ideas. Even under such conditions, with each writer&apos;s assigned portion edited by a master mind and approved by the group at large, the composite unity of the Scriptures would be a phenomenal achievement. BUT, theBible was not written that way! It was composed by forty or more writers who lived over a period of at least sixteen hundred years in about thirteen different countries and on three continents, and who wrote from vastly different backgrounds and experiences. They were shepherds, kings, soldiers,princes, priests, fishermen, scholars, historians, professional men, and common laborers. Their work was done in fields, deserts, caves, palaces, prisons,ships, and homes. They wrote on manifold subjects in many styles and at least three languages. And yet, in spite of such diversities and difficulties their heterogeneous works fit together with unfailing precision and uniformity,obviously designed one for the other.</text>

 <text id='' class='h1'><eng>Inspiration: Definition</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text class='h2'>What is meant by the term inspiration?</text>
<text class='h3'>Webster&apos;s dictionary defines inspiration as: The act of breathing into anything.</text>
<text class='h3'>The word inspiration is derived from the Latin <i>in spiro </i>meaning to &apos;breathe in&apos;. </text>
<text class='h3'>The word inspiration literally means <i>God breathed</i></text>
<text class='blockquote'>2 Timothy 3:16--All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.</text>
<text class='p'>The phrase given by inspiration ofGod is translated from the one Greek word: <i>theopneustos, </i>which is derived from <i>Theos</i> - God and <i>pneuma</i>The Holy Ghost. <i>Pneuma</i>is derived from a word that means breath. The literal translation of this phrase (given by inspiration of God) is: <b>GOD BREATHED.</b></text>
<text class='h2'>The word inspiration is used in reference to the Divine origin of the Scriptures. The Bible was not just written by the mind and hand of man. The Holy Ghost breathed the Word into the men who were the human tools of the Divine Author.</text>
<text class='blockquote'>II Peter 1:21--For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</text>
<text class='p'>The prophecy in this context refers back to verse 20 which says: <i>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</i> These verses refer to the prophecy contained in the Scripture. The Scripture did not come to us by man. The men were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. This Divine action of God moving upon man to give them the Word is what is meant by inspiration.</text>
<text class='p'>Do we have an inspired Word of God?Yes, we do! But, simply answering yes to this question is certainly not enough. Every Believer must know beyond all doubt that their Bible is none other than the breath of the Almighty God. (2 Samuel 23:2; Acts 1:16; Mark12:36)</text>
<text class='p'>All Scripture is excellent inspirit, beautiful in language and grand in prophetic imagery, but its superiority is not in natural talents nor is Scripture words of mere human invention, but its excellence lies in the fact its <b><u>words are breathed byGod.</u></b></text>
<text class='p'>(Heb. 3:7,8,15; John 13:18,21; Hab. 3:2,16; Isa. 51:16;59:21; Jer. 1:9; 5:14; 20:9; 23:18-19,22,29)</text> 
</div> 
<div class='chapter' id='s2c5'> 
 <text id='' class='h1'><eng>Inspiration: Deceptive Views</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text class='h2'>The Bible was produced by natural inspiration.</text>
<text class='p'>This false view holds that theBible is the product of genius of a high order, but not supernatural, orDivine. This is the type of inspiration that Milton, Shakespeare, or Confucius show in their writings. No man of intelligence, however, can go from readingShakespeare to reading the Bible without feeling that the difference between the two is more than just by degree. A book can be inspiring without being inspired. The Bible far supersedes the books of men. </text>
<text class='h2'>God used levels of inspiration to give us the Bible.</text>
<text class='p'>This false view claims thatGod used different levels of control at different times in the process of inspiration. This view advocates that sometimes God used Divine inspiration and at other times, God only offered suggestions or promptings of instruction.</text>
<text class='p'>This is totally contrary to true Biblical inspiration.</text>
<text class='h2'>God only gave the concepts or thoughts to the men who wrote the Bible. </text>
<text class='p'>Those who promote this false view advocate that only concepts or thoughts were given by inspiration. This position leaves the wording of the text to the minds of men. This again is contrary to the correct meaning of true Biblical inspiration. </text>
<text class='h2'>Only portions of the Bible are inspired.</text>
<text class='p'>This is a dangerous false doctrine referred to as partial inspiration. This position states that the Bible contains the Word of God, but is not all of Scripture is inspired. Who then decides what is and what is not inspired? Such a theory leaves man in awful and fatal uncertainty. </text>
<text class='h2'>What is the correct understanding of the inspiration of the Bible? </text>
<text class='p'>&quot;Verbal and plenary inspiration&quot; is the correct view. (Will be explained in greater detail next)</text> 
</div> 
<div class='chapter' id='s2c6'> 
 <text id='' class='h1'><eng>Inspiration: Declarations</eng> <swa/></text> 
<text class='h2'>The entire Bible is inspired of God.</text>
<text class='blockquote'>II Timothy3:16--<u>All scripture</u> is given by inspiration of God&hellip;</text>
<text class='p'><b>The view that the Bible in its entirety is inspired of God is called <i>plenary </i>inspiration. </b>Plenary means full or complete. The Complete Bible from Genesis to Revelation is the inspired Word of God. All Scripture is equally inspired.</text>
<text class='p'>Because it is inspired of God,the Bible is <i>infallible</i>. Infallible means <i>to be totally exempt from the possibility of mistake</i>. This word is applied to God who is not capable of error or mistake. Used in reference to the Bible, infallible refers to theDivine Authorship of Scripture. The Divine Author is infallible and thereforeHis Word is infallible.</text>
<text class='h2'>TheOld Testament is inspired by God.</text>
<text class='p'>Over and over again we can find the following phrases in the Old Testament:</text>
<text class='p'>&quot;Word of the Lord&quot;</text>
<text class='p'>&quot;God said/spake&quot;</text>
<text class='p'>&quot;God commanded&quot;</text>
<text class='p'> &quot;God appeared&quot;</text>
<text class='p'>&quot;the Lord said/spake&quot;</text>
<text class='p'>&quot;thus saith the Lord&quot;</text>
<text class='p'>These phrases affirm the inspiration of the Old Testament. The validity of these claims of inspiration is evident from the minuteness and detail as to names, times, and places which characterized their messages, and from the exact literal fulfillment of their prophecies.</text>
<text class='blockquote'>Acts 28:25--And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</text>
<text class='blockquote'>2 Peter 1:21--For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</text>
<text class='blockquote'>Hebrews 1:1--God,who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</text>
<text class='blockquote'>Dt.18:18-22--v.22 <b>When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not,nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.</b></text>
<text class='h2'>TheNew Testament is inspired by God</text>
<text class='p'>The writers of the NT claim inspiration for OT writers as well as for themselves:</text>
<text class='blockquote'>Acts 1:16--&hellip;this scripture must needs have been fulfilled,which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus..,</text>
<text class='h2'>The Men were Inspired</text>
<text class='p'> The Scripture declares that Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. -- 2 Peter 1:21 God breathed His Word through the men that were the human instruments to write the Bible. The prophet&quot;s spoken words from God were used by God to communicate with His people. The Lord instructed many of these men to write down His Words. The men were inspired and instructed by God to give His Word to the people.</text>
<text class='p'>1 Thessalonians2:13; John 6:63; Eph. 3:8-9</text>
<text class='h2'>The Words were Inspired</text>
<text class='p'>Not only were the men inspired by God, but the very choice of words came straight from the throne of God. God inspired the choice of the words of Scripture.<b> This is referred to as verbal inspiration.</b> The writers were not left absolutely to themselves in the choice of words that they should use. God guided the very wording of the Bible.</text>

<text class='blockquote'>Jude 17--But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of ourLord Jesus Christ;</text>
<text class='blockquote'>2 Peter 3:2--That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets,and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour</text>
<text class='blockquote'>John 12:48--He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</text>
<text class='h2'>The Letters were Inspired</text>
<text class='p'>The very letters of the words of the Bible are Divinely inspired. For example, let us look at the doctrine of&quot;one seed and not many&quot; through Christ which is established by the use of a single letter: &quot;s.&quot;</text>
<text class='blockquote'>Galatians 3:16--Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.[comp. Gen.22:16-18]</text>

<text class='p'>The &quot;s&quot; in this verse makes ALL the difference. The &quot;s&quot; makes the difference between singularity and plurality and most important the difference of stating that there is one mediator or stating there are many mediators. Had God said &quot;seeds&quot; instead of &quot;seed&quot; the promises could have come through Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed, the Pope or anyone else that chose this claim of fame. By definite use of singularity, God closes the door on false messengers and exalts Christ as the ONLY way to God. The promised seed could only be Christ and not Christ and Buddha or Christ and Mohammed. Jesus Christ alone was and is the promised seed.</text>

<text class='h2'>Every Iota was Inspired</text>
<text class='blockquote'>Matthew 5:18--For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</text>
<text class='p'>A <i>jot</i> could be equalled by an apostrophe (&apos;) and a <i>tittle</i> equalled by a hyphen (-).</text>
<text class='p'>&quot;The Bible is none other than the voice of Him that sitteth on the throne. Every book of it, every chapter, every verse, every word, every syllable, every letter is the direct utterance of <u>TheMost High</u>.&quot;--Dan Burgon</text>

 <text id='' class='h1'><eng>Inspiration: Definite Proofs</eng><swa/></text> 
<text class='p'>There are crystal clear proofs of the inspiration of the Bible. Besides the declarations of the text itself, multitudes of Biblical facts indicate that Scripture was Divinely inspired.</text>
<text class='h2'>Its Unbroken and Perfect Unity</text>
<text class='p'>The Bible contains 66 books written by approximately 40 different men in four languages spanning a period of 1600 years, by men living as far as 1500 miles apart. The men used were from all walks of life; they were kings, doctors,prophets, shepherds, servants, fisherman, and even a tax collector. Yet there is unbroken and perfect unity throughout the entire Bible. This could only be the work of God.</text>
<text class='h2'>Its Fearless Foretelling</text>
<text class='p'> The Bible foretells events many years and even centuries before they took place. The timing of the writing of the Old Testament prophecies can be historically documented because an accurate record of the history between theTestaments has survived. This historical record confirms the date of the ending of the Old Testament placing a four hundred year biblical silence between the last of O.T. prophecy and the start of N.T. fulfillments. The dates when the Bible books were written can be historically documented. TheSeptuagint, which is a Greek translation of the Old Testament, can be accurately placed at least two-hundred and fifty years before the birth ofChrist. Since the Greek Septuagint was translated from the Hebrew text there had to have been the Hebrew Old Testament in existence at least two-hundred and fifty years before the New Testament. This is historical proof that these prophecies were written hundreds of years in advance of their detailed fulfillment in the New Testament. There is no possible way that man could have made such accurate predictions. This is a definite and inarguable proof of theInspiration of Scripture.</text>
<text class='p'>EXAMPLES OF ACCURATELY FULFILLED PROPHECY:</text>
<text class='h3'>The Prophecies of Christ</text>
<text class='p'>He would be of the seed of Abraham -- Gen. 22:18 -- Mt. 1:1</text>
<text class='p'>He would be a descendant of David -- Jer. 23:5 -- Mt. 1:1</text>
<text class='p'>He would come from the tribe of Judah -- Micah 5:2 -- Mt. 1:2, Heb. 7:14</text>
<text class='p'>He would be born in Bethlehem -- Micah 5:2 -- Mt. 2:1</text>
<text class='p'>There were 29 prophesies fulfilled in one day during the events of the crucifixion ofJesus which were accurately predicted in great detail centuries before His death.</text>
<text class='p'>There are over 300 Messianic prophecies that were fulfilled in Christ.</text>
<text class='blockquote'>Acts 3:18--But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled. </text>
<text class='p'>Jesus fulfilled all the O.T. prophecies concerning Him despite improbability. No man is able to choose his lineage before he is born, yetJesus was born exactly according to the lineage as prophesied. There were other people involved in the fulfillments of these prophecies such as the Roman soldiers who parted Jesus garments among them and cast lots for His robe. Even the darkness that took place at the death of Christ can be historically documented and verified. The prophet Amos foretold of this darkness approximately 700 years before it occurred. There is no human explanation as to the accurate fulfillment of these Messianic prophecies. <b>This is a clear proof of the inspiration of the Bible!</b></text>
<text class='h3'>The Prophecies of Israel</text>
<text class='p'>Moses prophesied of the future of Israel. -- Deut. 4:23-38.</text>
<text class='p'>They would become captives because of their sin. --Is. 22:17, Jer.20:6.</text>
<text class='p'>They would be scattered into all lands. -- Deut. 30:1-3.</text>
<text class='p'>They would be persecuted. -- Lk. 19:41-44.</text>
<text class='p'>Preceding the time of Christ&quot;s return, Israel would be gathered again to her own land. (Luke 21:29-32; Eze. 36-37) This was fulfilled May 14,1948.</text>
<text class='p'>Ezekiel 36:24--For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.</text>
<text class='p'>God stated that He would watch over the people of Israel like a shepherd (Jeremiah 31:10). Less than 24 hours after Israel declared independence in 1948, its surrounding countries (Egypt,Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon) attacked Israel, hoping to replace the Jewish state with an Arab state. These countries are much larger than Israel, but tinyIsrael prevailed in that war and was able to capture additional land! Israel also prevailed in two other major wars that followed (Six-Day War, 1967 and YomKippur War, 1973).</text>

<text class='h3'>The Prophecies of Nations</text>
<text class='p'>Babylon was overthrown and brought down like Sodom as prophesied (Isa. 13:19; Jer.51:37). Daniel 5 describes the transfer of power to the Medes and Persians.</text>
<text class='p'>The Grecian Empire was the third kingdom described in the prophetic dream in Daniel2:39 with Babylon being the first Kingdom. Alexander the Great conquered the world exactly as was foretold in this prophecy. (This prophetic dream is studied in depth in the 3<sup>rd</sup> year <i>Prophecy</i> course.)</text>
<text class='p'>The division of the Roman Empire is also foretold in the division of the legs of the same image in Nebuchadnezzar&quot;s dream in Daniel 2.</text>
<text class='p'>Nineveh was laid waste by fierce nomadic peoples. Nahum (1-3, 3:7) foretold that the gates would be <i>set wide open to thine enemies</i> (3:13). The Tigris river flooded at the time of the attack and washed away much of the walls including the gates of the city.</text>
<text class='p'>Tyre was to be destroyed according to Ezekiel 26:3-14. This is a very specific prophecy given approximately 588 BC. The Scripture declares that many nations would come against Tyre. v. 3. God said he would bring the king of Babylon against them. v.7. The prophecy states that the stones, the timber and the dust would be cast into the water. v. 12. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did lay siege to Tyre for thirteen years. Alexander the Great took the city ofTyre on the Island in 332 BC by building a land bridge to the Island. They used stones, timber from the destroyed buildings and earthen fill to make what is called a mole (earthen bridge) in the water. The soldiers put the stones,timber, and dust into the water exactly according to the prophecy. This specific fulfilled event is beyond the mere speculation of man. The Bible is the inspired Word of God. The mole of Alexander the Great is still in existence today.</text>
<text class='p'>Jesus foretold of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. -- Mt. 24:1-2, Mk.13:1-3. The city of Jerusalem was destroyed in AD 70 under the Roman GeneralTitus. The temple was burned and the gold melted between the stones. The soldiers literally took apart the Temple stone by stone to retrieve the gold. Again the prophecy was fulfilled in detail exactly as Jesus said it would be.</text>
<text class='h3'>The Prophecies of the Last Days</text>
<text class='p'>2Timothy 3:1-9--v. 1 This know also, that in the last days&hellip;</text>

<text class='p'> There are numerous accurate descriptions of the last days found inScripture. These are just some of the prophecies that describe the condition of our day:</text>
<text class='p'>An increase of knowledge -- Dan. 12:4</text>
<text class='p'> Think of all the new innovations that have taken place within the last one hundred years. The Wright brothers &quot; first flight was in 1903 and today air travel is a common mode of transportation. There has been so much advancement in technology in a very short time.</text>
<text class='p'>Many false prophets -- Mt. 24:5,11</text>
<text class='p'>Wars and rumors of wars -- Mt. 24:6</text>
<text class='p'>Famines, pestilences and earthquakes -- Mt. 24:7</text>
<text class='p'>Iniquity shall abound -- Mt. 24:12</text>
<text class='p'>Gospel preached in the entire the world -- Mt. 24:14</text>
<text class='p'>Eating, drinking and marrying -- Mt. 24:38</text>
<text class='p'>As it was in the days of Lot -- Luke 17: 28-29</text>

<text class='h2'>Its Historical Accuracy</text>

<text class='p'>Archaeology is about learning about the past by finding things that were used by ancient peoples. These ancient artifacts tell us information about the people that used them. There have been many archaeological finds that support the historical accuracy of the Bible. As a matter of fact, no archaeological find has yet to contradict the Bible. Critics have argued that the Bible is not historically accurate, yet archaeology continues to validate the Bible as true.</text>
<text class='p'>A Hittite library was discovered in Turkey in 1906 confirming the accuracy of the Biblical record of the Hittite people.</text>
<text class='p'>There have been skeletons found of giant people confirming the description of giants in the Bible.</text>
<text class='p'>The remains of a crucifixion victim were found in Jerusalem in 1968. The victim&quot;s feet had one nail hole that penetrated through both feet and one nail hole in each of the lower arms. The man was believed to have been executed by the Romans in the Jewish uprising of AD 70. This confirms that crucifixion was indeed a means of execution used by the Romans as described in the Biblical account of the crucifixion of Jesus.</text>
<text class='p'>The Book of Acts has been confirmed to be historically accurate.</text>
<text class='p'>There have been inscriptions found containing the names of people described in the Bible in the locations the Bible places the people in.</text>
<text class='p'>There have been many archaeological finds that continue to confirm the historical accuracy of the Bible. This is more evidence that testifies to the inspiration of Scripture.</text>
<text class='h2'>Its Scientific Accuracy</text>

<text class='p'>The Bible is scientifically accurate. There are things described in theBible that the men that wrote them would have no way of knowing. God is the author of Scripture and knows all things.</text>
<text class='p'>The descriptions in the Bible are true and scientifically accurate.</text>
<text class='p'>The dimensions of Noah&quot;s Ark given to Noah by God are in perfect proportion for a most seaworthy vessel. Modern vessels that have been designed with advanced understanding of physics and the use of computer technology use the same proportions that Noah did. There is no way that Noah could have had access to this knowledge. The only logical conclusion is to believe theBiblical account that God give these dimensions to Noah.</text>
<text class='p'>The book of Job refers to the parting of light. Job 38:24 Light can be separated into parts with a prism. There is no way that Job which is the oldest book in the Bible could have known that light can be divided.</text>
<text class='p'>Ecclesiastes refers to the circuits of the wind. There are wind currents and patterns that have been discovered by modern science with the aid of satellites and computers. The men of the O.T. times would not have had access to such information, yet again the Bible accurately refers to the circuits of the wind.</text>
<text class='p'>How did the writer of Ecclesiastes know that the rivers run into the sea.--Eccl. 1:7</text>
<text class='p'>Isaiah spoke of God sitting upon the circle of the earth. Is. 40:22. The earth was not proven to be round until Magellan&quot;s expedition sailed around the world in the 1500&quot;s. Isaiah did not have access to such information. This again is a testimony to the Inspiration of Scripture.</text>

<text class='h2'>Its Peerless Power</text>

<text class='p'>Romans 1:16--For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</text>
<text class='p'>The Bible is more than just a book. The Bible is the Word of God. TheBible was written by Holy men of God moved upon by the Holy Ghost. The Bible is to be understood by the Holy Ghost moving upon you. Those who earnestly read the Bible in faith can be changed by the power of God. God can use the Bible to change men&quot;s lives. Many lives have been changed by the power of God by simply reading and believing the Bible.</text>
<text class='p'>The Bible has power to save people from all walks of life: drunkards, drug addicts, prostitutes, thieves, murderers, all sinners. All can be saved throughJesus Christ. Without exception, counsel and direction for every situation of life can be found in the Word of God. Unequalled and unrivalled, the Bible stands prominently above any and all other written works. Simply, the Bible is the only book God moved upon man to write for a pattern for eternity.</text>

	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>Definition of Canonization</eng> <swa/></text>
	<text class='p'>The process of the Bible books being gathered together into their current form is what is meant by: <i> Canonization of the Bible</i>. This process did not happen overnight. Remember that each individual book had to be laboriously copied by hand. The books were used and distributed by the religious leaders of the day. There were also other books written that claimed inspiration that were not included as part of our Bible. There were religious and historical books that were also in distribution at the time of this process of judging which books should be included into the Canon. This process of recognizing which books were inspired and which books were not is what we will study in this section. We will try to answer the question: How did the Bible come into its present form?</text> 

<text class='h2'>The word Canon comes from the root word <i> reed </i> .</text> 
<text class='p'>The reed was used as a measuring device. The English word is <i> cane </i> and the Greek word is <i>kanon</i> . The word canon means a rod, rule or measuring device. 3rd century church leader Origen used the word <i> canon</i> to refer to <i> the rule of faith. </i></text> 
<text class='h2'>The word Canon refers to the books that were judged to be of Divine origin.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The Biblical canon is the inspired books that have been collected together in the Holy Bible. Remember the word Bible means books and the Holy Bible is a collection of Holy books. The word Canon is simply the word that is used to refer to this collection of Holy books that we call the Bible which is the inspired Word of God.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The Old Testament Canon refers to the Old Testament books that were judged to be divinely inspired and included in the part of the Bible we call the Old Testament.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The New Testament Canon refers to the New Testament books that were judged to be divinely inspired and included in the part of the Bible we call the New Testament.</text> 
<text class='h2'>Canonization is the process of placing writings in the Biblical canon.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The Divine Author gave the Scriptures to Holy men of God.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The manuscripts were carefully copied by hand.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The books were not collected together in their current form immediately.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The Jewish scribes and religious leaders gathered the books together that were judged to be of Divine origin into the Old Testament Canon.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The early church leaders gathered the books together that were judged to be of Divine origin into the New Testament Canon.</text> 
<text class='h2'><i> Canonicity</i> refers to the fact that a book has been judged to be of Divine origin and has been included in the Canon.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Example: The Canonicity of the Book of Isaiah was recognized because it was deemed to be inspired by God.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Canonization in this context should not be confused with the Roman Catholic usage referring to the process of making dead people saints.</text> 
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='s3c3'> 
	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>Determination of Canonization</eng><swa/></text>
	<text class='p'>What determined which books would be included in the Bible and which books would not be included in the Canon of Scripture? This is an important question which must be able to be answered by the serious student of the Bible. You must know beyond doubt that the Bible in its current form is THE INSPIRED WORD OF GOD.</text> 
<text class='h2'>Incorrect Views on the Determination of Canonicity</text> 
<text class='h3'>The religious leaders determined Canonicity.</text> 
<text class='p'>Religious councils did not determine Canonicity. The councils of man can not make a book Scripture which in its own nature is not Scripture.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Critics will assert man had to decide which books to include in the Canon therefore placing doubt on the reliability of the Bible.</text> 
<text class='h3'>It has been argued that men chose only books that were in agreement with their religious views to be in the Canon.</text> 
<text class='p'>This is therefore said to be the only reason for the unity and harmony of the Scriptures. The argument is that men excluded books that did not agree with their views and included only books that did agree with their views. This false view places man as the determiner of theCanon.</text> 
<text class='h2'>CorrectViews on the Determination of Canonicity</text> 
<text class='h3'>God determined Canonicity.</text> 

<text class='p'>God gave to man the books that He wanted to be included in the Bible. God protected and preserved the books thatHe inspired and safeguarded their collection into the Canon.</text> 
<text class='h3'>TheDivine Inspiration of a book determined Canonicity.</text> 

<text class='p'>A book was included in the Canon because it was recognized to be the Divine Inspired Word of God. A book thatwas not deemed to be of Divine authority was not included as part of the Canon of Scripture.</text> 

</div>
<div class='chapter' id='s3c4'> 
	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>Description of Canonization</eng><swa/></text>
	<text class='h2'>The Old Testament Canon was divided into three categories.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>The Law &mdash; the writings of Moses.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>The Prophets &mdash; the writings of men who held the office of a prophet.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>The Writings &mdash; with the exception of Ruth and Lamentations the writingsof men who did not hold the office of a prophet. This section is also referredto as the Hagiographa in many of the Jewish texts.</text> 
<text class='h2'>TheMasoretic Text (MT)</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>The word <i> masoretic</i> means <i> traditional</i> . <i> Masoretic Text</i> refers to the traditionally accepted Hebrew Scriptures. The Masoretic Textswere originally controlled by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>The MT is the authoritative text of the 24 books of the Jewish canon ( <i> Tanakh</i> or <i> Hebrew Bible</i> ) complete with explanatory, grammar, pronunciation and spelling notations and significant textual details. (i. , the total number of letters on a given page could be found noted in the margin of a MasoreticText. )</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>The goal of the Masoretes was to wholly preserve the very form, words and meaning of the Scriptures. Any loss or change at all was inexcusable.</text> 
<text class='h2'>TheHebrew Scriptures were preserved by the priests.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>It was a priestly duty to preserve the written revelation of theScriptures. The priests were the divinely appointed guardians and teachers ofthe Law.</text> 

<text class='blockquote'>Deuteronomy31:24-26--And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded theLevites&hellip; Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.</text> 
<text class='p'>The law was placed in the charge of the priests to be kept by them alongside the Ark of the Covenant. The priests were also commanded to read the law every seven years.</text> 

<text class='h3'>The priests oversaw the task of making correct copies of the law for the use of kings and rulers.</text> 

<text class='h2'>Great care was taken to protect and preserve the inspired manuscripts.</text> 

<text class='h3'>Christ was faithful to His promise that the OT Scriptures would not perish.</text> 
<text class='blockquote'>Matthew 5:18--For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The scribes used various techniques to insure the accuracy of the copied manuscripts of the Hebrew text. They used tests such as counting vowelpatterns and checking for the placement of certain words within the text when checking the accuracy of a newly completed copy. The entire manuscript wouldbe discarded if it was found to contain an error.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>From the end of the first century until the Protestant Reformation, theHebrew Old Testament was preserved by the Jews.</text> 
<text class='p'>Jewish scribes carefully copied and preserved the manuscripts of the Old Testament. Augustine said, the Jewish scribes were the librarians of the Christian Church. The earliest of these scribes were called Tannaim (teachers). They copied the text of the OT with great accuracy. The Tannaim were followed by a group of scribes called Amoraim (Expositors). These were scholars who worked not only as copyists, but also produced TheTalmud which is a book of exposition on the laws and traditions of the Jews.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The traditional (Masoretic) text was printed at the end of the medieval period. The Psalms were printed in 1477. And in 1488 the entire Hebrew Biblewas printed for the first time.</text> 
<text class='h2'>The burial of the Hebrew manuscripts.</text> 
<text class='p'>The Jewish Rabbis held the copies of the HolyScriptures in great esteem. When a manuscript was too old and worn to be of any further use, they were reverently retired. It was believed to be better to give them an honorable burial than to allow the risk of them to be improperly used or profaned. This is the reason that there are only so many surviving copiesof Old Testament manuscripts.</text> 
<text class='h2'>The division of the Hebrew text into chapters and verses.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The division of the Scripture into verses is quite an early practice and were fixed by the Masoretic family of ben Asher about AD 900.</text> 
<text class='h3'>This system divides the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament (as we reckon them in our English Bible) into 23,100 verses. The Hebrew text is also divided into paragraphs.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The division into chapters was first done by Cardinal Hugh of St. Cherin 1244.</text>

	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>Discovery of the O.T. Canon</eng><swa/></text>
	<text class='h2'>InternalCross-Referencing</text> 
 
<text class='h2'>There is no complete historical record of the acceptance of each O. book; therefore, the narratives of theBible itself are the best historical records we have.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The <i> Books of the Law</i> were accepted immediately by Israel. -Ex. 24: 3-4</text> 
<text class='h3'>Joshua wrote in the book of the Law of God. &mdash;Joshua 24:26.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Samuel&apos;s book was placed before the Lord. &mdash;I Samuel 10:25.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The <i> Book of the Law</i> was re-established in Josiah&apos;s time. -IIKings 22:8-11,23:1-2</text> 
<text class='h3'>Ezra and Nehemiah admonished the people to pledge allegiance to the books of the Law of Moses. &mdash;Nehemiah chapter 8 and 10:28-29</text> 
<text class='h3'>Later writers recognized earlier writings as being God&apos;s authoritativeWord.</text> 
<text class='h4'>Daniel recognized the book of Jeremiah to be from the Lord. &mdash; Dan. 9:2</text> 
<text class='h4'>The books of the Law of Moses are mentioned in other books of the OT. -Josh. 1:8,8:31, I Kings 2:3, II Kings 14:6, 21:8, 23:25, Dan. 9:11-13, Mal 4:4</text> 
<text class='h4'>Solomon&apos;s writings are referred to in I Kings 4:32</text> 
<text class='h4'>Jeremiah mentioned Micah&apos;s prophecy from a century before. -26:17-29</text> 

<text class='h2'> Tests of Old Testament Canonicity</text> 
<text class='p'>There were tests used by the Jewish leaders to judge the canonicity of a book. These principals have been determined from the writers of Biblical and Church history. There was a systematic approach to the recognition of the Canonicity of a book. This section makes mention of theBiblical <i> writers</i> of the canonical books. These references are only in respect to the fact that they were the human tools of the <i>Divine Author</i>.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Was it written by Moses?</text> 
<text class='p'>Mosaic authorship of a book was considered a valid test of Inspiration by the Jews from time immemorial. Moses is reverenced as the great prophet of the Jews. The books that were written byMoses were considered to be of Divine origin from the earliest of the Jewish historical record. The evidence of archaeology in Palestine strongly supports this traditional view. Jesus confirmed that Moses was the human vessel who received the Law. Did not Moses give you the Law &mdash; John 7:19. As was already stated the Biblical account records the immediate acceptance of the books of the law as being given by God.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Was it written by a known prophet of God?</text> 
<text class='p'>If the book was written by a known prophet ofGod who was considered to be an oracle of God; then the book was believed to be the Word of God.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Was its writer confirmed by acts of God?</text> 
<text class='p'>The writer was considered to be a man of God ifhe had the witness of the power of God in his life. If the writer was considered to be a man of God then his writings were also considered to be fromGod. The sons of the prophets recognized the authority of Elisha when they saw him take up the mantle of Elijah and part the Jordan River. &mdash; II Kings 2:15.</text>

<text class='h3'>Is it in agreement with the rest of Canonical Scripture?</text> 
<text class='p'>There must be perfect unity of Scripture. Doctrine in one part of Scripture must agree with the truths contained in other parts of Scripture. As has already been stated some will argue that books were only chosen that agreed with the views of the leaders who chose them. Yet, a book could not be considered as Canonical if it was not in agreement with the rest of the received Scripture. A book was recognized as being Canonical because it was inspired. This as we can see was not the only test of theCanonicity of a book. And obviously a book of Divine origin would not contradict another book of Divine origin.</text> 

<text class='h3'> Does it tell the truth about God?</text> 
<text class='p'>The book must be accurate in its description of God and the things of God. The book would be rejected as being divinely inspired if it contained error concerning theology.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Was it accepted by the Jewish leaders as being authoritativeScripture?</text> 
<text class='p'>Some books were accepted by the Jewish leaders as being Canonical while others were not. This is a testimony that the Jewish leaders recognized the books that were included in their Canon to be authoritativeScripture.</text>

<text class='h1'>New Testament Testimony of the Old Testament Canon</text> 
<text class='h2'>Jesus confirmed the authority of the Old Testament Canon.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Jesus referred to the three divisions of the OT Canon: the Law, theProphets, and the Writings.</text> 
<text class='blockquote'>Luke 24:44--&hellip;all things must be fulfilled, which were written in <u> the law of Moses</u> ,and in <u> the prophets</u> , and in <u> the psalms</u> , concerning me.</text> 
<text class='h3'>It was common knowledge at the time of Christ that the OT was divided into these three sections. By mentioning these sections, Jesus was confirming the authority of the OT Canon as divided. The Jews of Jesus day would have understood that He was referring to the <u> complete Canon</u> (of the Old Testament) in this statement:</text> 
<text class='h4'>Jesus questioned the Jews: Did not Moses give you the Law? --John7:19</text> 
<text class='h4'>Jesus mentions the Law and the prophets. -Mt. 5:17; 22:40.</text> 
<text class='h4'><i> Psalms</i> generally refer to the section more commonly called <i>The Writings</i>.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Jesus read from the book of Isaiah. Lk. 4:17-21. Jesus referred to this passage as Scripture and thus confirmed the authority and inspiration of the text.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Jesus would not have quoted the OT books if they were not inspired.</text> 
<text class='h2'>TheNew Testament confirms the authority of the Old Testament.</text> 
<text class='h3'>There are about 263 direct quotations from the OT in the NT. The use of these quotes in the NT indicates that they were considered to be theAuthoritative Word of God.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>Paul referred to the OT writings as <i> Scripture</i>. Rom. 10:11; 11:2;Gal. 3:8</text> 
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='s3c7'> 
	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>Description of the N.T. Canon</eng><swa/></text>
	<text class='h2'>The New Testament Canon is divided into five categories.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Gospels: Matthew,Mark, Luke, John</text> 
<text class='h3'>History: Acts</text> 
<text class='h3'>Pauline Epistles: Romans,1&amp;2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1&amp;2Thessalonians, 1&amp;2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews*</text> 
<text class='h3'>General Epistles:(Hebrews*) James, I&amp;2 Peter, 1,2&amp;3 John, Jude</text> 
<text class='h3'>Prophecy: Revelation</text> 

<text class='h2'>The Textus Receptus</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>The Latin phrase <i> TextusReceptus</i> means <i> Received Text and refers to</i> the Greek New Testament manuscripts as they were commonly accepted by the early church. There is aclear traceable stream of the inspired text that was commonly accepted by the early church. God has preserved His Word through the ages.</text> 
<text class='h3'>99 % of over 5,200 manuscripts of the Greek New Testament agree with the KJV andErasmus&apos; Greek New Testament. Less then 1% (. 08%) agree with the odd omissions and changes in the TNIV, NIV, ESV, HCSB, NASB, NRSV, NLB, CEV, NCV, NAB, andNJB. (G. Riplinger, &quot;In Awe of the Word&quot;, 2003)</text> 
<text class='h3'>The <i> Textus Receptus</i> are theMSS which were used by the Reformers. TheChristian church recognizes the twenty-seven books of the <i> Textus Receptus</i> as being the New Testament Canon and all other MSS that remain are so contradictory and mixed up they cannot be considered trustworthy.</text> 
<text class='h2'>The first printed Greek New Testament</text> 
<text class='h3'>Erasmus published a Greek New Testament text in 1516. Erasmus used every available manuscript to print his Greek New Testament. He even referred to theLatin Vulgate which he believed to be greatly flawed and corrupt to insure that he looked to every possible source. He looked to gain the pure original meaning of the Holy Spirit inspired text. Erasmus&apos; Greek New Testament was a faithful consensus of the handwritten Greek texts which were used before the printing press. He used every manuscript available and compared them with great care to insure a correct Greek New Testament would be printed and circulated for the first time.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Erasmus did not create the <i> Textus Receptus</i> ; he <i> collected</i> and <i> printed.</i> He collected the many <i> handwritten</i> copies of Scripture in circulation and comparing one with the other discerned a true consensus among the MSS from which he printed his N.</text> 
<text class='blockquote'>We should not attribute to Erasmus the creation of a &apos;received text,&apos; but only the transmission from a manuscript text, already commonly received, to a <b> printed</b> form, in which this text would continue to prevail for three centuries. &quot; -- Kenneth W. Clark, Greek manuscript scholar (emphasis added)</text> 
<text class='h2'>The Holy Ghost guarded and preserved the true New Testament Text.</text> 
<text class='h3'>God&apos;s Word will not pass away.</text> 
<text class='blockquote'>Mathew24:35--Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</text> 
<text class='blockquote'> I Peter1:23--Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by theword of God which liveth and abideth for ever.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>The Holy Ghost taught the Christians which books were inspired.</text> 
<text class='blockquote'>John 14:25-26--These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter,which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>The Holy Spirit also led the Christians as to which books were not inspired. Some books were mistakenly regarded as canonical by some of the early Christians. For example, Ireneus considered &quot;The Shepherd of Hermes&quot; to be inspired. The Holy Spirit would eventually fix the canon in its current form of the 27 books of the New Testament.</text> 
 
<text class='h2'>The Received Text of the NT was preserved by the leaders of the Church.</text> 
 
<text class='h3'>In the very beginning of the church the Apostles instructed the church as to which books were inspired and which books were not. Remember John, the last of the original Apostles, was instrumental in instructing the Church and passing on the true inspired manuscripts of the New Testament until approximately AD 100.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The early church leaders passed on the manuscripts of theNew Testament. Ignatius and Polycarp, leaders of the early church, were taught by the Apostle John giving them direct Apostolic instruction as to the knowledge of the inspired manuscripts. Polycarp taught Irenaeus who would continue as a leader in the church. The leaders instructed their successors in the truth of God&apos;s Word.</text> 
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='s3c8'> 
	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>Discovery of the N.T. Canon</eng><swa/></text>
	<text class='h2'>There is some historical account as to the acceptance of the New Testament Canon.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The first New Testament books to be assembled together were the Epistles of Paul. A collection of Paul's Epistles was in circulation at the beginning of the second century. Ignatius a leader in the second century referred toPaul&apos;s epistles as Scripture. A collection of the Pauline epistles existed atthe time Polycarp wrote to the Philippians and when Ignatius wrote his seven letters to the churches of Asia Minor about AD 115.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The four Gospels were collected together in a compiled format sometime in the earlier part of the second century. The exact date when the Four Gospels were collected together is unknown. It is generally agreed that they must have been collected together and accepted before AD 170,because the four canonical Gospels are used by Tatian, a church leader, in his harmony of the Gospels written in AD 170. Irenæus , in his work &quot;Against Heresies&quot; (A. 182-88),names the four Gospels of the New Testament and refers to them as Scripture.</text> 

<text class='h3'>The four Gospels referred to as <i> The Gospel</i> and the Pauline Epistles referred to as <i> the Apostle</i> were in circulation as separate collections in the early years of the second century. These two parts were to be connected by the Book of Acts which brought the two collections together into one collection of books. This was the beginning stages of the collecting of the New Testament books into one complete Canon.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Before AD 200 the Epistles of Paul, theGospels, Acts, I Peter and I John were recognized as Scripture by the Christian church. The writings of Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian indicate the acceptance of these books as inspired and Canonical and accorded an authority equal to that of the Old Testament Scriptures.</text> 
<text class='h3'>The seven remaining books, 2 and 3 John, 2Peter, Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation, were accepted as Scripture aroundAD 300.</text> 

<text class='h2'>A testimony within the New Testament itself.</text> 

<text class='h3'>The Apostle Peter, shortly before he died, referred to Paul&apos;s Epistles as Scripture, and also makes mention of the rest of Scripture indicating thathe esteemed the other completed inspired books as Scripture. &mdash; II Peter3:15-16.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Revelation refers to itself as a book of prophecy. &mdash; Rev. 1:3, 22:18,19.</text> 

<text class='h2'>There is historical evidence of the use of the N. books by the early church leaders.</text> 

<text class='p'>Clement of Rome (97-140) wrote much from and about the New Testament. Clement of Rome in AD 95 wrote a letter inthe name of the Christians of Rome to those in Corinth. In this letter he uses material found in Matthew and Luke.</text> 
<text class='p'>Ignatius (AD35-116) refers to large portions of the New Testament. The Epistles of Ignatius (AD115) uses language from nearly all of the Pauline epistles. The Epistle to Polycarp mentions portions of Philipians and cites nine of the other Pauline epistles. Ignatius quotes from Matthew and also from I Peter and I John.</text> 
<text class='p'>Polycarp (AD 69- 155) refers much to the writings of the New Testament.</text> 

<text class='h2'>Thereis historical testimony of the acceptance of the Canon by church leaders.</text> 

<text class='p'>Theophilus (AD 115-188}, Bishop of Antioch AD 168, refers to <i> the evangelists</i> and <i> the Holy Scriptures</i> of the New Testament.</text> 
<text class='p'>Clement of Alexandria (AD115-188) in the latter part of the second century refers to the collection of the fourGospels as being recognized as Scripture.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Irenaeus (AD 130-200) refers to the New Testament writings as the Holy Scriptures. He quotes from every N. book except Philemon and IIIJohn. The New Testament Canon recognized by Irenaeus was very close to what we hold today.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Tertullian (AD 160-221) uses for the first time the termNew Testament, and calls the whole Bible the whole instrument of both Testaments.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Eusebius (AD 260-340) in approximately AD 330 divides all the 27 books of the New Testament into the disputed and non disputed categories.</text> 
<text class='h3'>Athanius (AD298-373), Bishop of Alexandria, in his Easter letter of AD 367 lists the 27 books of the New Testament and he used the phrase <i> being canonized</i> in regards to them.</text> 

<text class='h2'>Tests of New Testament Canonicity</text> 

<text class='p'>There were tests that were used by the early church to judge the Canonicity of a book. There were many church leaders involved at different times who judged which books were inspired and which books were not. The following four guidelines was used by these leaders in their discovery of the New TestamentCanon.</text> 
<text class='h3'> Was the book written by an Apostle?</text> 
<text class='p'>We understand that God is the author of the New Testament. The Apostles were some of the Holy men of God that The Divine Author spoke through. If a book could be proven to have been written by one of the original Apostles of Jesus it was considered to be of Divine origin. Much weight was put on the teaching and instruction of the original Apostles. The writings attributed to the apostles circulated amongst the earliest Christian communities.</text> 
<text class='h3'> Was the book approved by an apostle?</text> 
<text class='p'> It was believed that the original Apostles would know which books were inspired and which books were not. A book not written by an Apostle that had Apostolic approval was considered to be of Divine origin.</text> 
<text class='h3'> Was the book universally accepted by the early church by the end of the fourth century?</text> 
<text class='p'>There were certain books that were accepted almost immediately by the early church as being Divine Scripture. These books were readily included in the Canon. There were other books that took time to be accepted by the church as being Canon.</text> 
<text class='h3'> Was the book read publicly when the early church gathered for theLord&apos;s Supper?</text> 
<text class='p'>We have historical records from the early church leaders that indicate which books were read at church gatherings. These books were used by the church because they were considered to be inspired.</text> 
<text class='h3'> Was the book consistent with the rest of accepted Scripture?</text> 
<text class='p'>As has been stated in regards to the acceptance of Old Testament Scripture that a book must be in perfect harmony with the rest of the accepted Canon. Even so the New Testament books that were received must also be in harmony with both the Old Testament Canon and the New Testament Canon of Scripture.</text>
</div>

<div class='chapter' id='s3c9'> 
<text class='h1'>Homologoumena&#44; Antilegomena and Apocryphal</text> 
<text class='h2'>Homologoumena means <i> acknowledged</i> and refers to the readily accepted books of the New Testament.</text> 
<text class='p'>Twenty out of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament were readily and universally accepted as genuine, and called the Homologoumena. These twenty books were the fourGospels, the Acts, the epistles of Paul (except Hebrews), and the first epistles of John and Peter.</text> 
<text class='h2'>Antilegomena means <i> disputed</i> and refers to the books that were not readily accepted by the church leaders and took more time to be accepted into the Canon of Scripture.</text> 
<text class='p'>The seven books were Hebrews, II and III John, II Peter, Jude, James, Revelation. These were disputed for a time and called the Antilegomena</text> 
<text class='p'>There were various questions with regard to the books called Antilegomena. One question was that of whether they were really written by the men who were called their authors. Hebrews bore no name of its author, and differed in style from the acknowledgedPauline epistles; II Peter differed in style from I Peter; James and Jude called themselves servants; and not apostles; the writer of II and III John called himself an elder and not an apostle. Apostolic authorship was considered an important factor in recognizing the Canonicity of a book. There were many forgeries claiming apostolic authority, therefore these books were scrutinized more carefully before they were admitted into the Canon.</text> 
<text class='p'>Another question was that Jude recorded accounts not mentioned anywhere else in Scripture and makes mention of Enoch which was thought to be associated with the Apocrypha. The book of Revelation was not understood by many of the church leaders and therefore was questionable in their minds. These books were not at once accepted into their place in the Canon. After a deliberate examination,however, they were at last received as genuine, the very delay proving the close scrutiny which was involved in the process of Canonization. At the beginning of the fourth century they were received by most of the churches, andat the end of the fourth century they were received by all.</text> 

	<text id='' class='h2'><eng>Apocryphal Books</eng><swa/></text>
	<text class='p'>The Apocrypha generally refers to the books placed between the Old and New Testaments and included as an addendum to some Canons.</text> 
<text class='p'>These books derive their name from a Greek word, <i>apokruphos</i> ,which means hidden. They are called this because they are hidden and of unknownauthority.</text> 
<text class='p'>The Roman Catholic Church accepts the Apocrypha as part of their Canon of Scripture.</text> 
<text class='p'> The Jews regarded them as being a valuable history of their nation.</text> 
<text class='p'>These books did not meet the basic tests of Canonicity. They were not recognized as inspired books by the Jews. They were given a place by themselvesin the sacred volume, but with the distinct statement that they were not to be regarded as of equal authority with the books of the Canon.</text> 
<text class='p'>Some of the Church leaders also used this term to refer to any non-canonical book.</text> 
<text class='h2'>ThePseudepigraphical Writings</text> 
<text class='p'>This is a term applied to books deemed non canonical but claiming some kind of religious authenticity or value.</text> 
<text class='p'>Some of the books in this category were deemed forgeries claimingApostolic origin such as the Gospel according to Thomas.</text> 
<text class='p'>There were many books written that were not inspired, yet claimed some kind of Divine approval. The books in this category are termedPseudepigraphical Writings. This is a term that is used in many commentaries and research materials. The serious student of the Bible should at least havea basic understanding of what is meant by this term.</text>

<div class='chapter' id='s3c10'> 
	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>List of Various Canons</eng><swa/></text>
	<text class='h2'>Different Canons have been listed by different religious groups and church leaders throughout history.</text> 

<text class='h2'>The Jewish Canon</text> 
<text class='p'>The Jewish Canon is composed of the 39 books of the Old Testament.</text> 

<text class='h2'>The Samaritan Canon</text> 
<text class='h1'>The Samaritan Canon is the smallest Bible in the world recognizing only the fivebooks of the Pentateuch.</text> 
<text class='h2'>The Marcion Canon</text> 
<text class='p'>Marcion was the first to compile alist with some of the New Testament books. Marcion rejected the Old Testament entirely and regarded the God of the Old Testament as inferior to Jesus. Marcion&apos;s Canon comprised ten of the Pauline epistles (without the Pastorals)and Luke's Gospel. He edited these books to agree with his warped teaching.</text> 
<text class='p'>Even though he was false the rise of false teaching made the church more aware of the need to define a true Canon of Scripture.</text> 

<text class='h2'>The Muratorian fragment Canon</text> 
<text class='p'>The Muratorian fragment lists aCanon of New Testament books. The Muratorian fragment which is an ancient archeological manuscript dating back around AD 200 lists a Canon of NewTestament books. It is not fully readable and therefore is referred to as a fragment. It recognizes all the books except Hebrews, James, II Peter, andIII John. There is also a question as to whether I Peter is mentioned. It includes one book, the Apocalypse of Peter which was later rejected as being canonical.</text>

<text class='h2'>The Tertullian Canon</text> 
<text class='p'>Tertullian (AD160-221) had 22 books in his NT Canon which included the four Gospels, Acts, the thirteen epistles ofPaul, I Peter, I John, Jude and Revelation. He did not treat Hebrews asCanonical.</text> 
<text class='h2'>TheOrigen Canon</text> 

<text class='p'>Origen (AD. 185-254) acknowledged the four canonical Gospels, Acts, the Pauline epistles and Hebrews, I Peter, IJohn and Revelation as undisputed books. Origen acknowledged that Hebrews, IIPeter, II and III John, James and Jude as disputed books.</text> 
<text class='h2'>The Eusebius Canon</text> 
<text class='p'>Eusebius (AD 260-340) isconsidered a church historian. He provides us with a full statement in whichhe explains the position of the Church at large. He makes an importantdistinction between <i>homologoumena</i> (recognized books) and <i> antilegomena</i> (disputed books). The recognized books are the Gospels, Acts, the epistles ofPaul including Hebrews, I Peter, I John, and Revelation. He divides the disputed books into two sub-classes: (1) those that ought to be included in the canon &mdash; James, Jude, II Peter, II and III John (2) those that ought not to be included -- the Acts of Paul, the Shepherd of Hermes, the Apocalypse of Peter,the Didache, Barnabas. He also questioned the inclusion of Revelation based on some uncertainty as to apostolic authorship. Apart from his hesitation onRevelation Eusebius' New Testament is identical to ours.</text> 
<text class='h2'>TheAthanius Canon</text> 
<text class='p'>Athanasius (AD 298-373) Athanasius lists the 27 books of our New Testament.</text> 
 
<text class='h2'>The Roman Catholic Canon</text> 
<text class='p'>The Roman Catholic Church includes the 66 books of our Bible and also accepts the Apocrypha as part of their Canon of Scripture. This is the same Canon as Jerome&apos;s who produced the Latin Vulgate which is the basis for the Roman Catholic Bible.</text> 
<text class='h2'>The Recognized True Canon of the Christian Church</text> 
<text class='p'>The true Canon consists of the 39Old Testament books and the 27 New Testament books of the Bible.</text> 
<text class='h2'>TheLuther Canon</text> 
<text class='p'>Martin Luther listed the 27 books of our New Testament except he regarded four books as being questionable. He placed Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation at the end of his New Testament in a detached position.</text>

<div class='chapter' id='s4c2'> 
	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>The Preservation of God&apos;s Word into English</eng> <swa/></text>
	<text class='p'>The King James Version which is also called the Authorized Version is the Word of God preserved and translated into English.</text>
<text class='blockquote'>The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. - Ps 12:6-7</text>
<text class='h2'>God promised to preserve His Word for ever.</text>
<text class='blockquote'>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.-- Mt. 24:35</text>

<text class='h3'>God has kept His promise and preserved His Word in the English language.</text>

<text class='h3'>Not every modern English version is the pure Word of God.</text>

<text class='h2'>God guarded the translation of His Word into English.</text>

<text class='h3'>The word translation means that which is produced by turning words and phrases from one language into another language.</text>

<text class='h3'>God is able to keep His Word pure and complete even through the process of translation.</text>

<text class='h3'>Men paid the price with their very lives to preserve and pass on the Scriptures.</text>
<text class='h2'>The KJV is the pure Word of God in the English language.</text>

<text class='h3'>There is a pure stream of transmission from the Hebrew MASORETIC TEXT, the Greek RECEIVED TEXT, and the early English Bibles to the KJV.</text>
<text class='p'> The word Masoretic means traditional. This refers to the traditionally accepted Hebrew Text.</text>
<text class='p'> The Latin word Textus Receptus means received text and refers to the commonly accepted Greek Text of the New Testament.</text>
<text class='h3'>The KJV does not merely contain God&apos;s Word; it is God&apos;s Word.</text>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='s4c3'> 
	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>The Bible In Languages that would Later Develop into English</eng> <swa/></text>
	<text class='h2'>The Gothic language was an early predecessor of the English language.</text>

<text class='h3'>Gothic is an early root of the English language.</text>

<text class='h3'>Ulfilas also called Wulfila the Apostle translated the Bible into Gothic in AD 350.</text>

<text class='h3'>We start with this primitive root of the English language to show the clear stream of English Bible translation from the Hebrew Masoretic text and the Greek TEXTUS RECEPTUS. The Gothic Bible is in perfect harmony with the KJV and the RECEIVED TEXT.</text>

<text class='h2'>Anglo-Saxon is another step of the English language. </text>

<text class='h3'>This language is referred to as Old English.</text>
<text class='h3'>There is much historical evidence to show the use of Anglo-Saxon Bibles as early as the 6th century. Portions of these texts still remain today.</text>

<text class='h3'>The Wycliffe Bible states in the preface that the Bible had been translated into Saxon by Bede a seventh century theologian thus adding more historical support for the existence of at least portions of the Bible in Anglo-Saxon</text>
<text class='h2'>Middle English developed from Old English during the 12th through the 14th centuries.</text>

<text class='h3'>This pre-Wycliffe Bible English is another step in the development of the modern English language.</text>

<text class='h3'>There is archaeological evidence to support the existence of at least part of the English Bible before the Wycliffe Bible of 1389.</text>

<text class='h3'>Wycliffe in his preface mentions that he had gathered many older English Bibles. </text>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='s4c4'> 
	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>Progression of the Bibles</eng> <swa/></text>
	<text class='p'>English Bibles have been in agreement with each other and the RECEIVED TEXT from the Gothic to the KJV.</text>

<text class='h2'>The Wycliffe Bible.</text>

<text class='h3'>John Wycliffe translated a hand written copy of the complete Bible into English. This project took several years to complete which was finished approximately in 1380. </text>

<text class='h3'>The Wycliffe Bible predates Erasmus Greek NT so he could not have had access to it. Yet the Wycliffe Bible is in perfect harmony with Erasmus&apos; Greek NT indicating that the then common received Greek text available to Wycliffe was the same commonly received text which was the basis for Erasmus&apos; Greek NT.</text>

<text class='h3'>Wycliffe also used the original language manuscripts of Hebrew and Greek. </text>

<text class='h3'>Wycliffe did not use the corrupt Latin Vulgate as the basis for his translation.</text>

<text class='h3'>The Catholic Church tried many times unsuccessfully to stop the work of Wycliffe.</text>
<text class='h2'>The Tyndale New Testament</text>

<text class='h3'>Tyndale also followed the Pre-Wycliffe and Wycliffe Bibles closely. The Wording of the Tyndale NT is similar to that of the Wycliffe Bible.</text>

<text class='h3'>In 1525-1526 the Tyndale New Testament became the first printed edition of the Scripture in the English language. There are two copies still in existence today of this Tyndale first edition NT.</text>
<text class='h3'>Tyndale used the very simple popular language of the people. Tyndale himself realized there would one day be a need for a fuller translation with deeper vocabulary.</text>
<text class='h3'>A law punishable by death was enacted in 1530 that forbid owning or selling an English Bible. Foxe describes person after person, burned at the stake for owning the Scriptures in English.</text>
<text class='h3'>Tyndale&apos;s final prayer before he was burned at the stake in October of 1536 was: O Lord, open the King of England&apos;s eyes. This prayer would be answered just three years later in 1539, when King Henry VIII finally allowed, and even funded, the printing of an English Bible known as the Great Bible.</text>
<text class='h2'>The Coverdale Bible</text>
<text class='h3'>Myles Coverdale had worked with Tyndale on the OT Translation into English. Coverdale finished translating the OT and in 1535 he printed the first complete Bible in the English language.</text>
<text class='p'>THIS WAS THE FIRST COMPLETE BIBLE TO BE PRINTED IN ENGLISH!</text>
<text class='h3'>The Coverdale Bible consisted of Tyndale&apos;s NT and the portions of the OT that were completed by Tyndale. It was the work of Tyndale with Coverdale finishing the uncompleted portions of the OT.</text>
<text class='h3'>Coverdale who worked with Tyndale also used the Pre-Wycliffe and Wycliffe Bibles. The Coverdale Bible is in agreement with earlier English Bibles and the KJV.</text>
<text class='h2'>The Great Bible</text>

<text class='h3'>This was the first English Bible authorized for public use. Coverdale was hired by Cranmmer the Archbishop of Canterbury at the request of Henry VIII to publish a Bible.</text>
<text class='h3'>It was called the Great Bible due to its size. It was a pulpit version measuring over 14 inches tall. It was published in 1539.</text>
<text class='h3'>It was not just a reprint of the Coverdale Bible. Coverdale polished and refined the Tyndale Bible. The Great Bible was another step to the KJV.</text>
<text class='h3'>The Geneva Bible </text>

<text class='h3'>The Geneva Bible is so named because it was produced in Geneva by exiles from England. It was published in 1560.</text>
<text class='h3'>It was based on Tyndale&apos;s Bible and is almost identical to the KJV.</text>
<text class='h3'>The Geneva Bible was the first Bible taken to America. It was the Bible of the Puritans and Pilgrims. It is truly the Bible of the Protestant Reformation.</text>

<text class='h3'>The flaw of the Geneva Bible was the marginal notes were written by John Calvin and his assistants. The notes are strong Calvinistic and promote the false doctrines of eternal security and the predestination. </text>

<text class='h2'>The Bishops&apos; Bible</text>

<text class='h3'>Archbishop Parker along with other bishops produced in 1568 what is referred to as the Bishops&apos; Bible. It is so called because it was produced by the Bishops of the Church of England.</text>
<text class='h3'>The Bishops&apos; Bible was produced to conform to the structure of the Church of England, and to stand against the false notes of Calvinism contained in the Geneva Bible.</text>

<text class='h3'>It followed the common English translation. Most of the text is Tyndale&apos;s and it is very similar to the KJV.</text>

<text class='h3'>The Bishops&apos; Bible improved on the word order of earlier versions. The words were the same, but syntax was improved for clarity. This Bible was one of the main sources for the KJV.</text>

	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>The Commission of King James to Translate the Bible into English</eng> <swa/></text>
	<text class='h2'>The newly crowned King James convened the Hampton Court Conference in 1604. </text>

<text class='h3'>The conference consisted of church leaders gathered to address problems in the church.</text>

<text class='h3'>The Puritan president of Corpus Christi College, John Reynolds made a motion for a new translation of the Bible.</text>

<text class='h3'>A plan was formed to search out the best learned men to work on this translation.</text>

<text class='h2'>The resolution of King James:</text>
<text class='blockquote'>That a translation be made of the whole Bible, as consonant as can be to the original Hebrew and Greek; and this to be set out and printed, without any marginal notes, and only to be used in all churches of England in time of divine service.</text>
<text class='h3'>A resolve was made to keep the translation to the meaning of the original Hebrew and Greek. </text>

<text class='h3'>There were to be no marginal notes included in this translation.</text>

<text class='h3'>This was to be the standard Bible for the Church of England used in all times of Divine service.</text>

<text class='h2'>Translators were appointed by King James to complete the work.</text>

<text class='h3'>King James sought out the best qualified men. These men were the best Biblical scholars and language experts of their day. Many of them spoke several languages fluently.</text>

<text class='h3'>Strict guidelines were set for the process of translation.</text>

<text class='h3'>The King James Version was published in 1611.</text>

<text class='p'> THE KJV IS THE PURE WORD OF GOD, PRESERVED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!</text>

<text class='h2'>There are only two historical streams of Bible Manuscripts.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The manuscripts that came out of Antioch which are the source of pure Bibles and the KJV.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The manuscripts that came out of Alexandria which are the source of corrupted Bibles and the new modern versions such as the NIV.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>Ninety-five percent of the existing manuscript evidence can be traced to the pure texts from Antioch and is in agreement with the KJV.</text>
 
<text class='h2'>The pure stream of Antioch.</text>
 
<text class='li'>Antioch which was located in Syria is the first place the saints were referred to as Christians.</text>
 
<text class='li'>The texts from Antioch are known as the Syrian or Byzantine text.</text>
 
<text class='li'>These manuscripts from Antioch are those that were received by the majority of the Christian church and referred to as the Received Text.</text>
<text class='h2'>The polluted stream of Alexandria.</text>
 
<text class='li'>Alexandria is located in Egypt. It was a seat of false worship and pagan philosophy.</text>
<text class='li'>These Alexandrian texts were the source of Wescott and Hort&apos;s corrupt Greek New Testament and Jerome&apos;s Latin Vulgate.</text>
<text class='li'>The manuscripts from Alexandria were produced by Origen, Clement of Alexandria and other infidels who did not believe in the Divine inspiration of Scripture.</text>

<text class='h3'>Large portions of Scripture are missing from this manuscript:</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The Vaticanus came from the corrupt Alexandrian text</text>
 
<text class='h2'>The Sinaiticus was found in a garbage can in St. Catherine&apos;s Monastery on Mount Sinai in 1844 by Constantine Tischendorf.</text>
 
<text class='li'>Tischendorf, who discovered the Sinaiticus manuscript, noted at least 12,000 changes that had been made on this manuscript by others than the original copyist.</text>
 
<text class='li'>It also omits large portions of Scripture which are contained in the majority texts of Antioch.</text>
 
<text class='li'>This again is a Catholic manuscript and is a relative text to the Vaticanus.</text>
 
<text class='h2'>These corrupted manuscripts can be traced to the corrupt manuscripts of Alexandria.</text>
 
<text class='li'>Constantine, the first historical Pope, commissioned Eusebius to make 50 Bibles in AD 331. Eusebius was a follower of Origen and used the Alexandrian texts as the source for these Bibles.</text>

<text class='h3'>The Vulgate agrees with the existing manuscripts Vaticanus and Sinaiticus which are two of the Bibles of Constantine.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>Jerome&apos;s Vulgate became the basis for many of the new modern Bible versions. .</text>
 
<text class='h3'>Jerome altered his text to conform to the paganism of the Roman Church.</text>
 
 <text class='h2'>Anthony Hort and Brooke Wescott created a New Greek NT text in 1875.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>This corrupt Greek text is one of the sources of our modern Bibles.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>These men were involved in the Catholic Church and the occult, they did not believe in the infallibility of the Scriptures, and held many philosophies that are contrary to the Bible.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>They followed the pagan minority manuscripts of Alexandria that agreed with their pagan philosophy.</text>
 
<text class='h2'>Wescott and Hort used the Vaticanus and Sinaiticus manuscripts for their New Greek text.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>They rejected the <i>Textus Receptus</i>and chose to use the corrupt minority manuscripts of Alexandria.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The new versions supported by this Greek text stem from the paganism and idolatry of Egypt.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The devil used these men to attempt to undermine the KJV and promote the new false perversions of the Bible.</text>
 
<text class='h2'>This perverted Greek NT was the foundation for the English Revised Version, the American Standard Version, and other new modern Bible versions.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>Wescott ansd Hort used their new perverted Greek text as the foundation for the Revised Version New Testament which was published in 1881</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The Revised Version Old Testament published in 1885 follows the corruption of Jerome and the Alexandrian manuscripts.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>This was the first major attack by the devil on the pure King James Version of the Bible.</text>

	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>The Lie of New More Accurate Manuscripts</eng><swa/></text>
	<text class='h2'>KJV critics claim there have been new more accurate manuscripts found since 1611 that were not available to the KJV translators.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>It is true that there have been new manuscripts found since 1611. It is not true that they are more accurate than the Received Text of the KJV.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>Even though there have been new manuscripts found since 1611, there have been no new renditions of the manuscripts that were then available to the KJV translators.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The Sinaiticus was not available to the KJV translators, but the similar Vaticanus was available and rejected by the KJV translators</text>
 
<text class='h2'>The discovered manuscripts support the Received Text and the KJV.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The recently discovered manuscripts support the accuracy of the Received Text and the KJV.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>There are no readings available today which were not already in the hands of the King James translators.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The newly discovered manuscripts add to the volume of the majority texts of Antioch.</text>
 
<text class='h2'>The truth about the Dead Sea Scrolls.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The Dead Sea scrolls were found in the Qumran caves near Jericho in 1947. KJV critics claim these were older manuscripts not available in 1611 to the KJV translators.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The fact is these manuscripts are in total agreement with the Received Text and the KJV.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The Isaiah Scroll dated at 100 BC is the now oldest available manuscript and is in perfect harmony with the book of Isaiah in the KJV. So the truth of the matter is the oldest manuscripts support the KJV.</text>

	<text class='h2'>Rudolph Kittel produced a New Hebrew Old Testament text in 1909.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>This text is referred to as <i>Biblia Hebraica</i></text>
 
<text class='h3'>The devil had already produced a new Greek text and was again at work to change and twist the Hebrew text of the pure Bibles.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>This text differed from the traditionally accepted Hebrew Masoretic text used by the KJV translators.</text>
 
<text class='h2'>Rudolph Kittel was Anti-Semitic.</text>
 
<text class='h2'>This false Hebrew text was used as a source for the new modern Bibles.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The NIV used the <i>Biblia Hebracia</i>for the Hebrew translation of the Old Testament.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The New King James Version primarily uses the 1967/ 1977 Stuttgart edition of <i>Biblia Hebraica,</i>which was another publication of Kittel&apos;s distorted Hebrew text.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The new modern versions looked to this distorted text as a source for their translations.</text>

	<text id='' class='h1'><eng>A Look at the New International Version</eng><swa/></text>
	<text class='h2'>The first NIV was published in 1978.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The NIV is based on the Sinaiticus and the Vaticanus and on the <i>Biblia Hebracia</i>.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The NIV lists Kittel&apos;s Theological Dictionary as a reference source.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The NIV has been endorsed by the Catholics and is promoted as an accepted translation for Roman Catholics to use.</text>
 
<text class='h2'>The NIV adds and takes away from the Word of God.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>God gives warning to those who take away the word of God.</text>

<text class='p'>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>The NIV completely takes away 17 key verses and removes 64,576 words. That is approximately 8% of God&apos;s Word that is taken away.</text>
 
<text class='h2'>The new 2011 NIV Edition is moving toward a gender neutral version.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>This edition has been rejected by several denominations because of the gender inclusive wording.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>There have been some corrections made in some verses while changes have been made in others.</text>
 
<text class='h3'>This is a move towards a homosexual gender neutral version.</text>
