<h1>II John</h1>
<h2>General Details</h2>
<h3>Who it was written to:</h3>
<p>Whereas the first letter of John was written to the Christian family in general, this second letter of John was written to a particular individual in that family whom he names as &quot;the elect lady and her children&quot;.</p>
<h3>Why written:</h3>
<p>He wrote to warn a hospitable Christian lady against entertaining false teachers and admonished her to be on the lookout for deceivers who were going about saying that Christ had not actually risen in the flesh. He also included an urgent plea that they should show their love for God and His son Jesus by obeying the commandment to love each other and live their lives in obedience to the Scriptures. </p>
<h3>Theme:</h3>
<p>The believer&apos;s duty to love and obey the truth and to avoid fellowship with its enemies</p>
<h6>When written:</h6>
<p>The Book of II John would most likely have been written at about the same time as John's other letters, I and III John, approximately A. D. 90</p>
<h3>Where written:</h3>
<p>Probably at Ephesus where John lived and ministered after leaving Jerusalem</p>
<h3>Contents:</h3>
<h2>I. Introduction 1:1-3</h2>
<h2>II. Walk in truth, love and obedience 4-6</h2>
<h2>III. Do not participate in heresy 7-11</h2>
<h2>IV. Conclusion 12-13</h2>
<h2>I. Introduction 1:1-3</h2>
<p>John does not name himself in this letter, but begins this letter by simply introducing himself as &quot;the elder&quot;. No doubt her familiarity with him was such that no other introduction was necessary. He speaks of loving them in truth and for the truth. He pronounces grace, mercy and peace to them from the Father and the Son in truth and love.</p>
<h2>II. Walk in truth, love and obedience 4-6</h2>
<p>In v. 4, he rejoices that there were those who were walking in the truth and in v. 5 reiterates the command that they should love one another. In verse 6, he states that those who walk in love will walk in obedience to the Lord&apos;s commandments.</p>
<h2>III. Do not participate in heresy 7-11</h2>
<p>In verse 7, John speaks of the &quot;deceivers&quot; and how to identify them. In verses 8-9, he admonishes them to beware that they do not allow themselves to be influenced by these false teachers lest they not only lose reward, but lose their very relationship with God. In verses 10-11, he tells them not to receive them into their house or to bid them Godspeed lest they be partakers of their evil deeds. They must be careful not to aid them in any way in their evil work and so take part in it.</p>
<h2>IV. Conclusion 12-13</h2>
<p>John had many things he wanted to communicate to them, but chose to wait that he might tell them in person &quot;that our joy may be full&quot;. He passes on a greeting to them in closing.
 It is of utmost importance that we check everything we see, hear, and read, though it come under the label &quot;Christian,&quot; with the Scriptures. We cannot emphasize this too strongly because one of Satan&apos;s greatest weapons is deceit. It is very easy to be deceived by a new and exciting doctrine that appears to be based on the Word of God but which, if examined closely, is in fact a departure from it. If what we see, hear, and read does not line up explicitly with Scripture, then it is false and not of the Spirit, and we should have nothing to do with it.</p>
