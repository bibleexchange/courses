<h1>III John</h1>
<h2>General Details</h2>
<h3>Who it was written to:</h3>
<p>John sent this short letter to Gaius, a member of a local church to whom John had sent teachers.</p>
<h3>Why written:</h3>
<p>To commend Gaius for receiving the teachers he had sent and who were entirely dependent on the hospitality of believers and to denounce Diotrepnes inhospitable and tyrannical actions.</p>
<p>The reason John wrote this letter, judging from its contents, seems to be as follows:  John had sent a group of teachers with letters of commendation to the various churches, one of which was the assembly to which Gaius and Diotrephes belonged.  Diotrephes was in position of leadership of this church and because he “loveth to have the preeminence among them” (v. 9) would not show hospitality to these teachers.  What’s more, he would excommunicate any member of his church who would receive them.  Gaius, a member of his church, refused to be intimidated and received these teachers who later reported his kindness to John.  It seems that John was about to send these teachers out a second time (v. 6) and exhorts Gaius to continue his ministry of love to them.  John apparently wrote a letter of remonstrance to Diotrephes, but was ignored.  In response to this, John expressed his intention of paying a personal visit to this church and of deposing this ecclesiastical tyrant.</p>
<h3>Theme:</h3>
<p>The duty of hospitality toward the ministry and the danger of domineering leadership</p>
<h3>When written:</h3>
<p>The Book of III John was most likely written at about the same time as John's other letters, I and II John, approximately A. D. 90</p>
<h3>Where written:</h3>
<p>Probably at Ephesus where John lived and ministered after leaving Jerusalem</p>
<h3>Contents:</h3>
<h2>Introduction   1:1-4</h2>
<h2>Encouragement for Gaius   5-8</h2>
<h2>Do not follow that which is evil, but that which is good   9-12</h2>
<h2>Conclusion   13-14</h2>
<h2>Introduction   1:1-4</h2>
<p>John does not name himself in this letter, but begins this letter by simply introducing himself as “the elder”.   John probably didn’t need to identify himself or to establish his authority because he was well known to the people of the local churches and his brief letter was carried to Gaius by the teachers whom he sent.  John expresses a love for Gaius “in the truth” and a desire that he might prosper and be in health.  He rejoices that he is walking in the truth.</p>
<h2>Encouragement for Gaius   5-8</h2>
<p>John commends Gaius for his hospitality to the traveling workers.  He speaks of Gaius’ faithfulness and love for the brethren.</p>
<p>John said that the teachers he had sent went “taking nothing of the Gentiles”.  Apparently they took no provisions with them so they were dependant on the hospitality of the believers and the believers should receive them so that they might be “fellowhelpers to the truth”.</p>
<h2>Do not follow that which is evil, but that which is good   9-12</h2>
<h3>John tells them of the self-exalting and domineering Diotrephes – an evil example   v. 9-10</h3>
<p>In verse 11, John says, “He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.” It is impossible for an unregenerate sinner to “do good,” to walk in obedience to the Word of God.  Only a born again believer can do the will of God and then only as he is empowered by the Spirit of God.  The sinner does not have God’s love working in his heart that he might love God or his brother as God requires in His Word.  Nor does he have the grace of God to enable him to “do good” so his works show that he is not of God.</p>
<h3>John also mentions the well-reported Demetrius – a good example   v. 12</h3>
<p>It is not certain who this Demetrius was, but the context lends to the belief that he was one of the teachers whom John had sent, possibly the one carrying the letter.</p>
<h2>Conclusion   13-14</h2>
<p>John had many things to write to them, but chose not to as he believed he would see them shortly at which time he would communicate these things to them in person.</p>
