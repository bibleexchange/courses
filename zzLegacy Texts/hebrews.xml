			<text class='h1'>Introduction to Hebrews</text>
			<text class='p'>Hebrews has been referred to as the &quot;Fifth Gospel&quot; because it declares Jesus&apos; finished work on earth and His continuing work. Hebrews begins like an essay&#44; proceeds like a sermon&#44; and ends as a letter. The epistle abounds in contrasts of the Son and angels&#44; prophets&#44; priests&#44; and apostles. </text>
			<text class='p'>Hebrews was written originally to correct a spiritual condition of backsliding in a congregation of believers living in the first century. The same warning signs given for the first century are still standing for the last generation. Today&#44; as in the first century&#44; Satan is tempting Christians to turn away from simple faith in Christ&#44; trying to depreciate in the minds of people the glory of the Person and the Work of the Lord Jesus Christ; and to compare religions with Christianity.</text>
			<text class='p'>In Hebrews&#44; ample warnings are given saying Christianity is superior to Judaism and other religions. The immeasurable satisfaction and blessing of living with Jesus Christ cannot be found anywhere else. ALL religions&#44; forms&#44; practices&#44; and ceremonies must step aside and REPENT! Heb. 13:10.</text>
			<text class='p'>The altar we now have is through FAITH in the BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST that was shed on the CROSS of CALVARY! Rom.3:25; Heb. 13:20 &quot;Through the Blood of the Everlasting Covenant&quot; The new &quot;purges our sins&quot; 1:3. The new &quot;opened up a new and living way&quot; 10:19&#44;20; 4:16. More excellent ministry&#44; better covenant and better promises 8:6</text>
			<text class='h2'>Details of the Epistle</text>
			<text class='h3'>Date Written: 64-70 A.D.</text>
			<text class='p'>The context of the epistle throughout 5:1-6; 7-10 assumes that the temple is still standing and the whole sacrificial system were then in their normal operation. 8:13 shows that they were waxing old and vanishing away in 70 A.D.</text>
			<text class='h3'>Authorship: uncertain&#44; yet commonly attributed to Paul.</text>
			<text class='h3'>Original Readers</text>
			<text class='p'>This letter was first known in Rome and the West. The original readers were Jewish Christians who understood Greek.</text>
			<text class='h3'>Purpose</text>
			<text class='p'>To show the glory of the Christian life <i>in</i> the New Testament compared to being <i>under</i> the OldTestament. </text>
			<text class='p'>The book of Hebrews was written primarily to the Hebrews. (They were constantly going back to Judaism.) They attached too much importance on ceremonial observances.</text>
			<text class='h4'>Neglected faith - (The Revealed Word) 2:1-3 </text>
			<text class='h4'>Neglected truth - (The Principles) 5:12-13 </text>
			<text class='h4'>Drawing back from - (The Experience) 10:39&#44; 32; 13:5&#44;22</text>
			<text class='h3'>Key Verse: Hebrews 4:14</text>
			<text class='blockquote'>Hebrews 4:14 -- Seeing then that we have a great high priest&#44; that is passed into the heavens&#44; Jesus the Son of God&#44; let us hold fast our profession.</text>
			<text class='h3'>Key Words:</text>
			<text class='p'>
				<u>Better</u>; also Perfect&#44; Eternal&#44; Partaker&#44;Heavenly&#44; Blood&#44; Faith&#44; Sacrifice&#44; Covenant&#44;Son&#44; Let us&#44; Ministry&#44; and Love.</text>
			<text class='h2'>Background of the Epistle</text>
			<text class='h3'>The Jewish Christians had begun to undervalue the Christian principles and privileges.</text>
			<text class='p'> 5:11&#44;12; 6:12; 10:25&#44;32-39; 12:4&#44;5&#44;10-16; 13:1-5&#44;15&#44;17&#44;20-22</text>
			
			<text class='h3'>God&apos;s Final Message to Judaism</text>
			<text class='p'>Remember&#44; Jerusalem is without a Pastor and Jerusalem will soon be destroyed including the temple (70 AD).</text>
			<text class='h4'>The old was decaying and vanishing away. (8:13)</text>
			<text class='h4'>In a time of adversity (13:3)</text>
			<text class='h4'>Some in prison&#44; many suffering adversity</text>
			<text class='h4'>A reminder of the prophets of old (11:33-38)</text>
			<text class='h4'>Ye have not (yet) resisted unto blood (12:4)</text>
			<text class='h4'>Call to remembrance the former days ye endured a great fight of affliction.(10:32)</text>
			<text class='h4'>Get back to your first love (13:3)</text>
			<text class='p'>Paul saw the gap that was created when James&#44; the pastor in Jerusalem was tortured to death for his faith inChrist in 62 AD. James (the Just) was the overseer in Jerusalem&#44; the Lord&apos;s brother. James spent so much time on his knees praying&#44; his knees were callused like camels&apos; knees. The Scribes and Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin together&#44;took counsel against James and demanded that he proclaim from one of the galleries&#44; that Jesus was not the Messiah. He cried Jesus is the Son of God and Judge of the world. They threw him to the ground from the gallery&#44; stoned him with stones&#44; beat him with a club&#44; while he cried&#44; &quot;Father&#44; forgive them&#44; for they know not what they do.&quot; Then his life expired. The Christians were faced with many changes in persons and temptations.</text>
			<text class='p'> 13:8 Jesus Christ the same</text>
			<text class='p'> 13:5-9; 2:18; 4:15; 5:7-8; 10:35-39; 12:1-29 run with patience</text>
			
			
			
			<text class='h2'>Contents of the Epistle</text>
			<text class='h3'>Five Major Warnings are Given:</text>
			<text class='h4'>A warning of <u>neglecting</u> &quot;So Great Salvation&quot; through the Son 2:1-4</text>
			<text class='h4'>A warning of coming short of the promises because of <u>unbelief</u>. 3:7-4:13</text>
			<text class='h4'>A warning against <u>spiritual immaturity</u>. 5:11-6:20</text>
			<text class='h4'>A warning of <u>willful sinning</u>(rejecting truth). 10:25-39</text>
			<text class='h4'>A warning of obstinate <u>refusal</u>of Christ (rejecting Christ). 12:25-29</text>
			<text class='p'>Their faint-heartedness and backsliding resulted from divers and strange doctrines. (Heb. 13:9) The cure is found in a right conception of the glory and work of Christ. (Heb.1:1-3;8:10; 13:20-21) Remember David in I Samuel 22:1-3.</text>
			<text class='p'>Note the skill of the writer in dealing with the despondent and despairing Christians.</text>
			<text class='h3'>The Glory of the Person and Work of Christ</text>
			<text class='p'>The first thing he does is fill their minds with the glory of the Person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ. (Heb.1:1-4)</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than the Prophets</u> (1:1). The prophets were great but Jesus is greater. He is the Son of God. The prophets spoke the Word of God&#44;Jesus is the Word of God and His work is complete. (1:3; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2; 1:2; Numbers 12:6,8)</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than the Angels</u> (1:4-2:18).</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than Moses</u> (3:1-6). Moses was a faithful servant in the house&#44; but Christ is the Son of God and owner and builder of the house&#44; whose house are we.</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than Joshua</u> (4:8&#44;12) Jesus is the Word of God.</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than Aaron</u> (4:14-5:5; 7:11)</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than Melchizedek (</u>5:6-11; 6:20-7:28)</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than Abraham</u> (6:13-7:10)</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than the House of Israel and the Old Covenant</u> (8:10&#44; 6-13)He is a minister of the true tabernacle (8:2).</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than the Tabernacle</u> (9:1-28)</text>
			<text class='h4'>
				<u>Greater than the Law</u> (10:1-13:20-21)</text>

			<text class='p'>Angels are spirit beings that were made by God as messengers that carry the urgent fiery messages of God to people.The Son of God is a Spirit but not a created being like the angels; He is GodHimself who rules and reigns over the universe.

			<text class='h1'>The Danger of Neglecting Salvation through the Son (2:1-4)</text>
			<text class='h2'>A Great Danger</text>
			
			<text class='p'>The Great Danger is that men will not heed the Gospel. Pay Close Attention for there will be no EXCUSES: &quot;It slipped my mind&quot; &quot;Time slipped by so rapidly&quot; &quot;My steps had well nigh slipped&quot; (Ps. 73:2). There is an intense attention demanded! &quot;GIVE!!!&quot; </text>
			<text class='p'>If we are not careful we are in danger of: Drifting away 2:1; Punishment 2:2; Judgment 2:2; No substitute 2:2; No captain 2:10; Fear 2:15; Bondage 2:15; No reconciliation 2:17; No help 2:18; Temptation 2:18</text>
			<text class='p'>God&apos;s last word is Christ. He is the fulfilment of the prophetic hopes of Israel. Christ holds a unique relationship to the Father and the Holy Ghost; and stands in contrast to angels who are created beings. <b>On this doctrinal basis&#44; a warning is given: Men must listen to the Son.</b> If it was necessary in O.T times. to heed the word of angels (Gal. 3:19), how much more necessary is it to heed the Word of the Lord? There is no hope of salvation outside of Jesus Christ.</text>
			<text class='h3'>The Force of a Word Given by Angels</text>
			<text class='blockquote'>Heb. 2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast&#44; and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</text>

				<text class='p'>Judgment accompanied the word of angels.</text>
				<text class='h4'>Nadab and Abihu</text>
				<text class='p'>Nadab and Abihu offered strange fire and died. (Lev. 10:1-7)</text>
				<text class='h4'>Achan</text>
				<text class='p'>Achan took of the spoil of Jericho and Israel was defeated on the battlefield until Achan and his family were stoned and burned. (Joshua 7) A curse was on Jericho. If just one took of the accursed thing it would make the whole camp of Israel a curse and trouble it. (Joshua 6:18) Achan took&#44; all Israel paid for it. Israel went to the battle field without knowing what Achan had done and suffered defeat. 36 men died. (Joshua 7:1) </text>
				<text class='p' >Provision was made for Israel who was in ignorance&#44; but the Israelites that sinned with a high hand died without mercy&#44; stoned and burned. A strict concept of justice was maintained throughout O.T. history.</text> 
			
			<text class='h3'>The Force of a Word Given by the Lord</text>
			<text class='h4'>God's Judgment is Inevitable</text>
			<text class='p'>If judgment fell on those who transgressed the Law given by the mediator of angels&#44; how much more punishment on the one who rejects the Word of God&apos;s Son? (Heb. 10:26-31) We (under the new covenant) <u>now</u> should give more earnest heed than they (under the old covenant) did.</text>
			<text class='p'>The warning contains an unanswerable question: (2:3) &quot;How shall <u>we</u> escape if <u>we</u> neglect so great salvation?&quot; The emphasis is properly placed on the <b>we.</b> Those who perished under Moses are a warning to us. The Gospel has brought greater privileges but also greater responsibilities. We should not do despite to God&apos;s grace. (10:29)</text>
			<text class='h4'>God's Standard is Unchanging</text>
			<text class='p'>God&apos;s standard of holiness and righteousness has not been altered and He still expects perfect obedience from His people and more so now (10:25). The fullness of this so GREAT salvation was first proclaimed by Jesus. He both proclaimed the good things of full Salvation and made them possible by His sacrifice.</text>
			<text class='h4'>God's Message is Unmistakable</text>
			<text class='p'><b>This WORD did not cease with the Messiah</b>&#44; but this WORD lived on in His disciples. Matt. 28:18-20; Mark16:15-20; Luke 24:46-49; John 20:21-23; 21:15-17 &quot;Feed them&quot; ALL: My love, My law, My life.</text>
			<text class='p'>The preaching of the Gospel is continued and confirmed with:</text>
			<text class='h5'><b>SIGNS</b> - He stilled the storm. (He can still every storm.)</text>
			<text class='h5'><b>WONDERS</b> - Fed 5000 and more with 2 fish and 5 barley loaves.</text>
			<text class='h5'><b>DIVERSE MIRACLES</b> -Cast out devils&#44; lame walk&#44; dumb speak&#44;blind see&#44; etc.</text>
			<text class='h5'><b>GIFTS OF THE HOLY GHOST</b> - Christ continues His ministry through gifts of the Holy Ghost given to the Church. ( I Cor. 12:1-11; Eph. 4:11)</text>
			
			<text class='h2'>A Great Salvation</text>
			<text class='p'>God has a Great Plan of Salvation.</text>
			<text class='blockquote'>Heb 2:1,3 -- Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard&#44; lest at any time we should let them slip. 3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation;</text>
			
			<text class='h3'>Great in Its Foundation</text>
			
			<text class='p'>The chief requirement in constructing a sea wall is to get a foundation which can stand unmovable in the heaviest of storms. The shifting sand must be pierced down to granite rock. This harbor has foundations whose builder and maker is God.</text>
			<text class='h4'>Jesus is the chief corner stone. (Eph.2:20)</text>
			<text class='p'>It&apos;s all fitly framed together inHim. Jesus is the Rock of our Salvation. (Psa. 89:26) Jesus is the same yesterday&#44; today and forever (Heb. 13:8).</text>
			
			<text class='h4'>The Word of God is the foundation.(John 1:1; Heb. 6:17-19)</text>
			<text class='p'>Salvation is founded on two immutable things: Counsel and Oath of God. This foundation is mighty enough to inspire a strong consolation to those who have fled for it through faith for refuge. Gospel &mdash; ship; Hope &mdash; anchor</text>
			<text class='p'>No matter what storm is raging, God&apos;s Word is still in effect!</text>
			<text class='p'>The storm clouds of judgment are rising at sea. I Peter 4:17-19 Jude 23; II Peter 3:6&#44;9; Matt.24:37; Matt. 11:28-30 &quot;Come unto me all ye&hellip;&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>Heaven and earth will pass away but not one jot or tittle will pass from God&apos;s Word. God&apos;s Word is a Rock that can&apos;t be moved. A safe&#44; strong and sure foundation.</text>
			<text class='h4'>God&apos;s Original Plan of Salvation</text>
			<text class='p'>God&apos;s original plan was for man to have an <i>eternal</i> life of peace and fellowship with God. <u>Man neglected the Word of God</u> and the Tree of Life; man slipped and fell. (Crossed God and His Word) <u>Jesus was as a Lamb slain</u> from the foundation of the world. (Total obedience) Rev. 13:8 <i>Man&apos;s neglect</i>brought judgment into effect! (Rom. 5:19) <i>Christ&apos;s obedience</i> brought God&apos;s plan of salvation into effect!</text>
			<text class='p'><i>Salvation is a great word. </i>1:14; 2:3; 2:10; 5:9; 6:9; 9:28<i/>Mentioned 6 times in the book of Hebrews. Number6 is the number of man. &quot;Peak of human achievement&quot;</text>
			
			<text class='h4'>Salvation is from God for Man. Salvation from the:</text>
			<text class='h5'>Penalty of sin. Rom. 6:23 (like the wind at your back.)</text>
			<text class='h5'>Power of sin. (A perpetual process.) I Cor. 1:18; II Cor.1:10; Rom. 8:2; Eph. 2:1&#44;2; Heb. 2:14</text>
			<text class='h5'>Wrath of God. John 3:36; Rom. 13:11&#44;12</text>
			<text class='h5'>Law of sin. Rom. 8:2 (Not from the Law of God! <u>Love</u>fulfills the Law!)</text>
			<text class='h5'>Fall. Heb. 2:8-10</text>
			<text class='h5'>Fear of death. Heb. 2:15</text>
			
			<text class='h3'>Great in Its Sweep</text>
			<text class='p'> As you look up and down the harbor&#44; you see many that have anchored in Jesus. Look at them! They have held on. They have continued to give the more earnest heed.</text>
			<text class='h4'>Sufficient to embrace a tested and ruined world.</text>
			<text class='h4'>Room enough for whole navies of souls to ride at anchor.</text>
			<text class='h4'>Space enough for every ship of Adam&apos;s race from the shores of time to launch there. LOOK!!!</text>
			<text class='p'>Luke 8:2. There was a vessel once manned by seven devils known as the pirate ship of the universe. But captured by the Lord&#44; and at the stern is the name <b>Mary Magdalene</b>.</text>
			<text class='p'>Luke 23:42. Then we have another ship that had been dismasted; mainsails torn to threads; ship was shattered and sinking almost completely under for the last time when he cried out&#44; &quot;Lord&#44; remember me&quot; <b>The Dying Thief</b></text>
			<text class='p'>Acts 9:6 and 14 Epistles.Find there yet another vessel; one&#44; long determined to tear down the very walls of this great harbor and sink every ship that has been anchored there. But now flying at the very highest point of His ship among the multitudes which no man can number of all nations&#44; kindred&#44; peoples and tongues with the name on the flag in BOLD letters. <b>Chief of sinners and least of saints.</b></text>
			<text class='p'>The Apostle Paul was completely changed. He went from tearing down to building up -- writing 14 books of theNew Testament.</text>		
			<text class='h3'>Great In Its Cost</text>
			<text class='h4'>Illustration #1</text>
			<text class='p'>When the South American Fort was being constructed&#44; thousands of slaves sacrificed their lives. The average life span of a slave was 6 months. They would begin to work knowing in6 months they would be dead. What a price. They mixed with their own hands the body and blood of many slaves knowing one day soon&#44; they would be treatedthe same.</text>
			<text class='h4'>Illustration #2</text>
			<text class='p'>In Whales&#44; Great Britain&#44; while building a tubular bridge over the Menai Straits&#44; 500 men perished during the construction. There is a column beside the bridge with all the names of those men that sacrificed their lives. Nothing is said of the money that it cost. <u>The soul is worth more than any amount.</u> These men worked because it was theirjob.The slaves were forced to work. Jesus voluntarily came&#44; died and rose again.</text>
			<text class='h4'>The Cost of the Cross</text>
			<text class='p'>The harbor of our salvation is the cross. In the middle of its mouth&#44; brightly shining as a flaming sword&#44; so that every ship coming in or drifting away can see the inscription: &quot;IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME&quot; &quot;TheSon of God&quot; who sacrificed His peace&#44; rest&#44; light&#44; love&#44; life for the sins ofthe whole world! What a trade What a provision. What a sacrifice.</text>
			<text class='p'>It seems to be an easy thing to besaved&#44; but we don&apos;t always remember all that happened before it became so easy.The agony&#44; long hours of prayer&#44; sleepless nights&#44; hungry days&#44; rejection&#44; blasphemy&#44;blood&#44; sweat&#44; tears&#44; the cross&#44; the cries&#44; the burial&#44; THE PRECIOUS COSTLYDEATH! It cost Him His:</text>
			<text class='h5'>GLORY (John17:5)</text>
			<text class='h5'>BLOOD (Heb.13:12)</text>
			<text class='h5'>REPUTATION (Phil.2:7)</text>
			<text class='h5'>NATURE (John1:14)</text>
			<text class='h5'>FELLOWSHIP WITHTHE FATHER (Matt. 27:46)</text>
			<text class='h5'>STRENGTH (John10:18)</text>
			<text class='h5'>POSITION INHEAVEN (John 1:24;14:2&#44;3)</text>
			<text class='h5'>RANK (Matt.13:55)</text>
			<text class='p'>IT COST JESUS EVERYTHING! Heb. 1:3 &quot;By Himself&quot; He gave it all up for whosoever that would believe in Him. (1 John1:12) Because he humbled Himself to the condition of humanity&#44; The Believer can now become what He is. (Heb. 2:9&#44;10; 2:1-4)</text>
		<text class='h2'>Summary:</text>
		<text class='p'>Why is salvation so great? Its magnitude is due to two things: 1) The GREATNESS of the One who proclaimed it&#44; for He is ETERNAL! 2) The great fact that God in the person of His Son suffered for our sins!</text>
			<text class='p'>Nothing of old&#44; now or new can parallel or complete our salvation except the BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST! In the former days&#44; man&apos;s sins were covered through the animal sacrifices until the righteous penalty for sin should be paid by the RIGHTEOUS LAMB OF GOD! Salvation of old was on credit. Now the bill is paid! Sin&#44; punishment and penalty have been PAID IN FULL! <b>
					<i>Look who did it!</i>
				</b><b>
					<i>The only one who could have! The sinless&#44; divine Son!</i>
				</b>
			</text>
			<text class='p'>I Peter 3:18 The JUST died for the unjust. Matt. 1:21 &quot;Thou shalt call His name Jesus&quot; Redemption has been accomplished! God solved your problems at Calvary!</text>
			<text class='p'>Salvation could be compared to a GREAT HARBOR where tempest driven souls can find shelter--Rest&#44; Peace&#44; Light&#44;Love&#44; Life</text>
			<text class='p'>Conditions out at sea: Turbulent storms, Tons of icebergs, Tidal waves, Treacherous hail stones, Terrible hurricanes, Tempestuous winds, Thunder, Tornadoes, Tremendous resistance.</text>
			<text class='p'>Remember making an effort in the right direction does not mean your going forward&#44; especially under these conditions.</text>
			<text class='p'>Look up and down the shores of time and see the multitudes that have slipped into eternity. LOST!! Many made an effort&#44; but slipped away. Heb. 2:1 &quot;Give the more earnest heed:&quot; Look again up and down the shores right now and see the souls sliding out into eternity. STOP THEM! Watch for people that lose their grip on the Word. SECURE THEM IMMEDIATELY! Get them to look at the harbor! Heb. 12:2 At the right hand of the throne of God. Jesus is the great harbor. &quot;So great salvation&quot; Look! &quot;Give heed&quot; to its greatness.</text>

			<text class='h1'>The Son and Humanity 2:5-18</text>
			<text class='h2'>A. Lowly man regaining his integrity. 2:5-8&#44;13</text>
			<text class='p'>As the contrast continues betweenChrist and the angels (2:5) our attention is focused on the future.&quot;The world to come&quot; There has always been the hope for a golden age. CHRIST is the sovereign of the future and He has plenty of power to accomplish His purpose and plenty of time for He is eternal. OUR future well-being depends upon our present well-doing. </text>
			<text class='p'>Heb. 2:8 Man failed and lost his dominion. 2:5 Christ is the ruler of the world to come. The overcomer will reign with Christ. Dan. 7:27; Psa. 37:11; Matt. 5:5; Rom. 4:13; Rev. 2:27; Psa.2:8&#44;9; II Tim. 2:12; Rev. 5:10</text>
			<text class='blockquote'>Hebrews 2:6 -- What is man that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>This question arose in Psa. 8:3. It is in contrast with God&apos;s great creation of the heavens&#44; man appears to be insignificant. Why should God care about a lowly man? B Three Reasons Why Heb.2:7&#44;8</text>
			<text class='h3'>1 God made man. Gen. 1:26&#44;27; 2:7; James 4:14 </text>
			<text class='h3'>(Dust of the ground &amp; Breath of God)</text>
			<text class='h3'>2 God crowned Him with glory and honor.</text>
			<text class='h3'>3 God put all things in subjection under Him.</text>
			<text class='h3'>Heb. 2:8 &quot;But now we see not yet all things under Him&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>Why should an unfailing God seek continuously a failing people? As long as we look to man&#44; the question goes on unanswered. 2:9 &quot;But we see Jesus&quot; When we look to Jesus&#44; the question is answered. (Luke 19:10; John 1:14; Matt. 11:29)</text>
			<text class='p'>2:10 &quot;Many sons&quot; Like His only begotten Son. The desire of the ages is only fulfilled in Christ (Eph. 2:7;3:5; 3:21; Col. 1:26). God&apos;s Eternal purpose is purposed in Christ Jesus&#44; ourLord (Eph. 3:11).</text>
			<text class='h2'>B. The purpose of the Son of God partaking of the flesh. 2:9-18</text>
			<text class='p'>-1 Christ&apos;s purpose in his first coming was to fulfill God&apos;s Eternal purpose2:9-10 God made man from dust. Sin is making an attempt to bring all flesh to dust again&#44; separating Man from the breath of God. Man was made a noblecreature with the ability to glorify God and live a life of richness and honor.</text>
			<text class='p'>What happened? Sin (Rom. 3:23; Gen. 2:17; Ez. 18:4&#44; 20) Lucifer went outside his limits and fell down. When man stepped outside his limits the world refused to be limited by him.</text>
			<text class='p'>John 14:30-31 Christ became man and stayed within the limits of love and obedience to the Father and brought the earth back into subjection to man. He paid the penalty of sin. Jesus destroyedthe works of the devil. (Heb. 2:14; I John 3:8) And put the plan of salvationinto effect.</text>
			<text class='p'>Jesus was crowned with glory and honor as a man and He was exalted to the Father&apos;s right hand in Glory. Heb.1:3-2:9; Col.13:4</text>
			<text class='p'>Heb. 12:2 Jesus endured the cross&quot;For the joy that was set before Him&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>Jesus is the captain of salvation in bringing many sons unto Glory. Heb.2:10 &quot;bringing many son&apos;s unto glory.&quot; Christ identified Himself with humanity as the son of man .Now He associates humanitywith Himself. He gives the believer the power to become sons of God. John 1:12</text>
			<text class='p'> (2) Tomake the sanctifier and the sanctified all of one. (Heb. 2:11-14)</text>
			<text class='p'>vs. 11 the union of the Redeemerand the redeemed is set forth</text>
			<text class='p'>In bold print. The <u>sanctifier</u>and the <u>saved</u> are of <u>God</u> and are called <u>brethren.</u>

			<text class='p'>Heb. 2:12 - Christ declares theFather&apos;s name &quot;unto&quot; His brethren</text>

			<text class='p'>The <u>glorious</u> purposes ofsalvation are addressed to man NOT to Angels.</text>
			<text class='p'>2:16 - &quot;He took <u>not</u> on Himthe nature of angels&#44; but He took on Him the seed of Abraham.&quot; Heb. 7:14</text>
			<text class='p'>When His own received Him not&#44;(John 1:11)&#44; His message spread to the whole world. John 3:16</text>
			<text class='p'>In order to redeem His brethren&#44; Hewas made like them. 2:17He became the true man. The high priest must be humanand chosen among men. If He is to understand and represent fallen humanitybefore the Majesty on High&#44; He must know the meaning of temptationand suffering. One of the early heresies in the early Church was Docetism. &quot;They said Jesus seemed to be human but wasn&apos;t. </text>
			<text class='p'>The writer in Hebrews leaves noquestion. To become our High Priest&#44; Jesus had to share humanity to the pointof suffering. The High Priest Ministry </text>
			<text class='p'>2:17 - &quot;<u>In things pertaining toGod</u>&#44; to make reconciliation for the sin of the people. As the High Priestof the O.T. offered sacrifices&#44; Jesus offered Himself to the Father as asacrifice for all mankind.<i> Jesus was merciful</i>. Jesus was personally freefrom sin&#44; but the sufferings of humanity Has Enabled Him to know man&apos;s motives&#44;temptations and weaknesses. Isa. 42:1-4 Matt. 12:18-21 Luke4:16-20&#44; 24</text>

			<text class='p'>A whole generation of people perished in the wilderness except Joshua and Caleb. This is a warning to everygeneration that rejects the Gospel.</text>

			<text class='h2'>The Warning against Unbelief (3:12-19)</text>
			<text class='p'>The hardness of heart in thewilderness generation is compared with those who reject the Gospel. The messageis given in a form of warning &quot;Take Heed&quot; If you don&apos;t prevent unbelief fromgetting in&#44; unbelief will prevent you from getting in. The attention has beenon yesterday - Past Israel</text>
			<text class='p'> 3:7 The Holy Spirit says&quot;Today&quot; Tomorrow is only a Promise 4:6&#44;7</text>
			<text class='p'> vs. 13 daily promise to thebeliever and obedient (4:9-10-36)</text>
			<text class='p'> vs. 15 &quot;If ye will hear&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'> vs. 16 &quot;When they heard&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'> &quot;Provoked&quot; v.16 &quot;Sinned&quot; v. 17 Believed not&quot; v.18</text>
			<text class='p'> vs. 19 No faith - No entrance</text>
			<text class='p'> Hebrews 3:10-13&#44;17-19</text>
			<text class='p'>The contrast between Heb. 3 and 4is:</text>
			<text class='p'>· 3:19 &quot;They could not enter in because of unbelief.</text>
			<text class='p'>· 4:3&#44;12-16 Could enter by faith</text>
			<text class='p'>(Compare Heb. 3-4 with Rom.7-8)</text>
			<text class='p'>*Wilderness Experiences*</text>
			<text class='p'>The power of the Egyptians on theIsraelites had been broken by a series of marvelous miracles. Ex. 5-12</text>
			<text class='p'>Israel stood victorious on theshores of the Red Sea. Ex. 14:1-2</text>
			<text class='p'>Then faced their first test afterleaving Egypt. Ex. 14:10</text>
			<text class='p'>Ex. 14:15 &quot;Go Forward&quot; was theword from God</text>
			<text class='p'>Ex. 14:13 &quot;Stand still&quot; was theword of man</text>
			<text class='p'>Ex. 14:31 Israel on the other shoreof the Red Sea saw the great work of God.</text>
			<text class='p'>They watched long lines of corpsescome up to the waters edge. This should have been a sign to Israel that youcan&apos;t fight God. Many men of Israel at this time now can focus on their dreamsof future possessions in the Promise Land.</text>
			<text class='p'>The subtle devices of unbeliefdestroyed them. Only two&#44; Joshua and Caleb made their dreams come true. One byone the bodies that fell in the wilderness were buried in the sand. It took 40years for all of them to die. A constant murmuring and moaning of grief washeard in their camps. Sin grieves God 3:10-11&#44;19</text>
			<text class='h2'>A. TheConditions in the Wilderness</text>
			<text class='h3'>1 <b>Unrest</b> - tents constantly being struck by winds. Have you evertried to sleep in a tent? How about live in one? Contending with the weatherconstantly. Pitched many times in the same spot. Could not enter into God&apos;srest because of unbelief.</text>
			<text class='h3'>2 <b>Aimlessness</b> - They wandered in a desert place.They found no cityof habitation.</text>
			<text class='h3'>3 <b>Unsatisfied longings</b> - Hungry and thirsty&#44; their souls fainted (3:10)always erring in their hearts</text>
			<text class='h3'>4 <b>Sand storms</b> - When the hot wind is blowing the light powdery dustand sand&#44; it always finds its way into the eyes&#44; nose&#44; mouth&#44; lungs&#44; and ears&#44;piercing through the clothes and irritating the skin&#44; making it sting andcausing unbearable pain.</text>
			<text class='h3'>5 <b>Mirages</b> - Many oasis seen to attract the weary traveler&#44; but ashe reaches them he finds his hopes were deceived&#44; his thirst was mocked and hisheart hardened. His hope fades away into the air. His faith decreases. His lovedeceases.</text>
			<text class='h3'> &quot;We are made partakers ofChrist&quot; Heb. 3:14By grace through faith in truth. We must listen to the Wordor it will take conditions like these to make us partakers of Christ. Two outof two million five hundred thousand were made partakers of the Promise Land atthat time. Moses was allowed later. (Matt. 17:1-8 Mark 9:2-10; Luke 9:28-36)</text>
			<text class='p'>Jesus knows the way through thewilderness&#44; all we have to do is believe and follow.</text>
			<text class='h2'>B. TheCause of Unbelief in the Wilderness Heb. 3:19</text>
			<text class='p'>Unbelief raises a barrier whichshuts us off from the blessing. The devil can&apos;t shut off the blessing&#44; but hecan set a snare to attract you and when you are drawn away from the path thatGod is leading the devil will build a barrier that you can&apos;t get back on track&#44;therefore&#44; shuts you off from the blessing. ONLY by faith in God&apos;s Word can youovercome. Unbelief thrives on three conditions.</text>
			<text class='h3'>1 Murmuring. Num. 14:1-4 &quot;They murmured.&quot; </text>
			<text class='h3'>Ex. 16:2&#44;3 No bread; Ex. 17:3 Nowater</text>
			<text class='h3'>2 Departing from the living God Heb. 3:12</text>
			<text class='p'>Detoured&#44; side tracked&#44; drawnaway of your own lusts. The Israelites forsook the fountain of living water. (Jer.2:13) They went into the mountains and hewed them out cisterns. The cisternswould break loose and not hold any water.</text>
			<text class='p'>Unbelief is like the fungus thatwould grow on the side walls of their broken cisterns. Fungusgrows in the dark and feeds on dead things. Unbeliefcan&apos;t stand the sunlight of fellowship with God. </text>
			<text class='p'>If there is a decrease in our heart&#44;it will affect our commitment&#44; prayer life&#44; our close walk with God&#44; our enjoymentand respect for worship in the house of God and unbelief is sure to manifestitself in many ways every time. Keep your heart right with God all the time. Backsliding- Heb. 3:12</text>
			<text class='h4'>a. The Subjects -&quot;Brethren&quot;</text>
			<text class='h4'>b. The Cause -&quot;Unbelief&quot;</text>
			<text class='h4'>(the fruit of an evil heart)</text>
			<text class='h4'>c. The Manner - Turning away from God for something else.</text>
			<text class='h4'>d. The Preventative -&quot;Take heed&quot;</text>
			<text class='h4'>(Examine) &mdash; Closely scrutinize.</text>
			<text class='h3'>3 They failed to learn their lessons well. 3:16-19 </text>
			<text class='p'>Not all provoked God&#44; but thosethat sinned grieved Him forty years. All that sinned fell in the wilderness. Theydidn&apos;t have faith in the promises. Ex. 3:8 Psa. 78:19 They didn&apos;t take holdof His guarantee. Heb. 3:18; 4:2</text>
			<text class='h2'>C. TheCaution Heb. 3:12</text>
			<text class='h2'>Hardness of heart produces unbelief.</text>
			<text class='h3'>4 It is an evil heart.</text>
			<text class='h3'>5 It is an unperceived process. Constantly hearing the truth and notobeying it will cause your heart to harden.</text>
			<text class='h4'>e.  &quot;Take heed&quot; Guard against an <u>evil</u> <u>heart</u>. Heb. 3:12 Anevil heart harbors sin. It all starts when the tender heart begins to harden.</text>
			<text class='h4'>f.  &quot;Take heed&quot; Guard against a <u>hard</u> <u>heart. </u>Heb. 3:13; IICor. 13:5 Hard hearts are unbelievable.</text>
			<text class='h4'>g.  &quot;Take heed&quot; Guard against the <u>deceitfulness</u> <u>of</u> <u>sin</u>.Heb. 3:12-13</text>
			<text class='h4'>h.  &quot;Take heed&quot; Guard against <u>unbelief.</u> Heb. 3:12&#44;14 Holdconfident faith steadfast unto the end.</text>
			<text class='p'>Take warning&#44; a house settles whenthe stress comes. We are His house and we must be partakers of Him. He is theRock that can&apos;t be moved.</text>
			<text class='p'>We can only partake as we holdfastthe confidence and rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. Heb. 3:6; 4:16; 3:7&#44;13&#44;15; 4:3&#44;7&#44;9&#44;14&#44;16</text>
			<text class='p'> &quot;Today&quot; - Now <u>is</u> God&apos;s time; &quot;Take heed&quot;- &quot;Today&quot;; &quot;Hold fast&quot; - &quot;Today&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>· Heb. 3:7 The Holy Ghost says &quot;Today&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>· 3:13 The Apostle says &quot;Today&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>· 4:17 The Word of God says &quot;Today&quot; Psa. 95:7-11</text>
			<text class='p'>A chain of faith will lead to perfection in Christ. Fullydeveloped son&apos;s of God.</text>
			<text class='p'>(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)(Faith)</text>
			<text class='h2'>D. TheConfession of Faith as Sons of God (Heb. 4:14; 3:14; 2:10)</text>
			<text class='p'>When you begin to question the Wordof God you are in trouble. Confession must be by acknowledgment of the Truth. Realfaith holds fast to the Word. Real faith confesses the Word. Many have lostconfidence in the Word because of surface reading and negative preaching.</text>
			<text class='p'>Faith in your senses is unbelief. Jonah2:8 If you accept the physical evidence you make void the Word. Heb. 10:23 &quot;Without wavering&quot; Faith agrees with theWord. Unbelief agrees with the pain. Doctors practice -Jesus HEALS.</text>
			<text class='p'>Don&apos;t tell how you hurt - confesswhat the Word says. God&apos;s Word is trustworthy (Num. 23:19; Heb. 4:12).Yourfeelings are not trustworthy - don&apos;t hold on to what you feel. Don&apos;t fear yourproblem but fear God. Heb. 4:1A wholesome Godly fear:</text>
			<text class='h3'>1 The blessing of a Godly fear - &quot;His rest&quot;</text>
			<text class='h3'>2 The offer to the God-fearing believer - All the promises of God</text>
			<text class='h3'>3 Those that fear God but not enough may - &quot;come short&quot; of the promises.</text>
			<text class='h3'>4 The warning -&quot;Let us therefore fear&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>Remember when you confess yourfaith in the promises as son&apos;s of God that it is of the spiritual nature andnot the physical gender as a man.</text>
			<text class='p'>The nature of our temptations willgenerally prove where we really are spiritually. Confess the Word with fearand obedience.</text>
			<text class='p'>The higher the moral character themore subtle the temptations. Christ could never be tempted with the course andcommon sins. Christ is the Son of God and He was tempted and we will be temptedthe same as we grow more and more like Him. &quot;If thou be the Son of God&quot; 4:3</text>
			<text class='h3'>1 He was tempted to seek a lawful thing in an unlawful way. Matt. 4:3&#44;4 &quot;AfterwardHe hungered&quot; Matt. 4:2 (Temptation to satisfy yourself) He was tested for beingthe Son of God. Matt. 4:3; 27:43</text>
			<text class='h3'>2 He was tempted to make a display of His power for the honor of His ownname. Mat. 4:6  &quot;Cast thyself down&quot; were the words of the devil&#44; he knew hecouldn&apos;t cast Christ down so he tried to get Him to cast Himself down. Thescheme was if He cast Himself down&#44; angels would bear Him up. (Temptation tohonor yourself.)</text>
			<text class='p'>We are never to display our gifts&#44;power&#44; authority&#44; abilities&#44; money&#44; song&#44; speech or works just to show we arethe sons of God but for His Honor and Glory. (II Tim. 2:15; I Peter 4:10-14)</text>
			<text class='h3'>3 He was tempted to accomplish the purposes of God by adopting adishonoring method. (Matt. 4:8&#44;9; Zech.14:9; I Chron. 29:11; Rev. 11:5)</text>
			<text class='p'> (Temptation to step outside of theFather&apos;s plan and bypass the agony of the cross.) - To expect thepromised blessing by using means that oppose the Word and are contrary to thecharacter of God.-</text>
			<text class='p'>There is a hunger for the Kingdomof God and it can only be attained through worshipping God.</text>
			<text class='p'>Adam and Eve fell to thistemptation. Abram did when he took Hagar. Israel did when they asked for aking.</text>
			<text class='p'>The Gospel of Christ must be preachedwith the anointing of the Holy Ghost and received by faith&#44; anything else is fallingshort.</text>
			<text class='h3'>4 He was tempted to speak unadvisedly with his lips. Luke 11:53&#44;54 Set awatch over your tongue.</text>
			<text class='h3'>5 He was tempted to save himself by forsaking the cross. (Matt. 27:40-43) An often repeated temptation is to deny the cross (suffering).(Gal. 2:20; Matt. 16:24&#44;25; Heb. 13:12&#44;13; I Peter 4:14; Heb. 11:26; Matt.11:28-30)</text>

			<text class='p'> What are the essential qualities?</text>			
			<text class='li'> 1. Sympathy with men.5:1-3</text>
			<text class='p'>Compassion on the ignorant and Compassion on them that are out of the way</text>
			<text class='li'> 2. Called of God. 5:4-10</text>

			<text class='h2'>Sympathy with men. 5:1-3</text>
				<text class='h3'>Compassion on the ignorant</text>
				<text class='h3'>Compassion on them that are out of the way</text>
			
			<text class='p'>A priest has compassion because he himself is compassed with infirmity.</text>
			<text class='p'>Man brought sin into the world&#44; and it was necessary that deliverance meet certain qualification.</text>
			<text class='p'>The order of Christ&apos;s priesthood differs from the Levitical priests&#44; both were chosen from among men and accepted by God&#44; but watch! </text>
				<text class='p'>but watch! &quot;Jesus the Son of God&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>Stress has already been placed on the true humanity of Jesus.</text>
			<text class='p'>He was chosen from among those whomHe was to represent before God.</text>
			<text class='p'>As Priest&#44; Jesus was &quot;ordained for men.&quot; 5:1 (Jesus the Son of God was Appointed to act on behalf of man before God.)</text>
			<text class='p'>The offerings of Jesus&#44; like those of the Old Testament Priest&#44; are described as &quot;gifts and sacrifices for sins.&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>1. &quot;gifts&quot;- all offerings&#44; bloodless or bloody</text>
			<text class='p'> 2. &quot;sacrifices&quot; - the shedding of blood of the victim</text>
			<text class='p'> Christ obeyed the Father through His whole life even to sacrifice and be sacrificed at Calvary.</text>
			<text class='p'> &quot;OBEDIENT UNTO DEATH&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'> Note: <u>All</u>priests must have a sacrifice.</text>
			<text class='p'> The ministry of thepriest is one of compassion. 5:2</text>
			<text class='p'> Sympathy itself is aform of suffering.</text>
			<text class='p'> It&apos;s a gift to have.</text>
			<text class='p'> It&apos;s a giftto give.</text>
			<text class='p'> It also canbe a sacrifice.</text>
			<text class='p'>The priest does not side with the sinneragainst the righteous demands of the Holy God&#44; but he does show a sympathy withthe sinner at the very time he expresses by word and act&#44; severity towardsin. Rom. 11:22</text>
			<text class='p'>Compassion is expressed toward the&quot;ignorant&quot; and them that are out of the way. The Levitical offerings madeprovision for the one who sinned in ignorance. Num. 15:27-31&#44; not for the soul that doeth aught presumptuously. The soul that sins in ignorance may experience sympathy from God and discipline to bring him to the place of obedience to God&apos;swill. The soul that rebels meets judgment.</text>
			<text class='p'>Restoration to divine favor is onlypossible after repentance.</text>
			<text class='p'> Mark 1:15 Luke13:3&#44;5</text>
			<text class='p'> 2. Called of God 5:4-10</text>
			<text class='p'>Remember it&apos;s a divine call&#44; not apersonal choice. &quot;No man take this honor unto himself.&quot; You must be called ofGod for this ministry.</text>
			<text class='p'>It&apos;s not achoice to choose. It&apos;s not a choice to refuse.</text>
			<text class='p'>The office of the Great High Priestwas by Divine appointment. Jesus&#44; although not of the line of Aaron was clearlycalled as High Priest.</text>
			<text class='p'>Heb. 5:5 Psa. 2:7 Matt.3:17; 17:5 Mark 1:11 Luke 3:22</text>
			<text class='p'>He was to be heard and obeyed.</text>
			<text class='p'>To be more specific concerningChrist&apos;s Priesthood. Heb. 5:6 Psa. 110:4</text>
			<text class='p'>Thou art a Priest forever after theorder of Melchizedek.</text>
			<text class='p'>Although all Priests in Israel hadto be in the line of Aaron.</text>
			<text class='p'>The law before Aaron spoke of aPriest who was recognized by Abraham. Gen. 14:20</text>
			<text class='blockquote'>Hebrews 7:14 -- Itis evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses spoke nothingconcerning Priesthood. </text>
			<text class='blockquote'>Hebrews 7:15 -- Andit is far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek therearises another Priest. </text>

			<text class='p'> 3. Possess the Knowledge of Experience</text>
			<text class='p'>All of the sinless infirmities ofthe human race were shared by Jesus. Heb. 2:18; 4:15; 5:7 He experienced thepangs of hunger at the very beginning of His ministry&#44; Mark 11:12&#44; and utteredthe cry &quot;I thirst&quot; at the close. John 19:28</text>
			<text class='p'>He desired most the friendshipand loyalty of His disciples&#44; but they all forsook Him and fled. Peter&#44; Jamesand John (the inner circle) did not watch with Him one hour in the garden. Luke22:45 Judas betrayed Him for thirty pieces of silver. Matt. 27:3</text>
			<text class='p'>He did mighty works in Capernaum&#44;but they still rejected Him and so did Nazareth&#44; the city of His youth.</text>
			<text class='p'>He experienced poverty from themoment of His birth in a stable in Bethlehem to His burial in Joseph&apos;s tomb. Matt.27:57-61</text>
			<text class='p'>It was said of Him &quot;the Son of manhath not where to lay His head.&quot; Matt. 8:20</text>
			<text class='p'>Heb. 5:7 What challenging pictureof the human Jesus struggling in prayer. We see the Savior offering &quot;prayersand supplications&quot; 5:7 This verse expresses a heart burdened at the prospect ofimpending calamity. Luke 22:53</text>
			<text class='p'>Think of it&#44; there would be no hopefor mankind if Christ would not have gone to the cross&#44; arose the third daymorning and made it possible for every believer to escape death and be freefrom sin. Jesus tasted death&#44; but in so doing He opened up the way of Eternallife.</text>
			<text class='p'>The temptations of Jesus &quot;in allpoints&quot; included the issues of death&#44; but He accepted the Father&apos;s will and&quot;for the joy that was set before Him&quot; endured it&apos;s agonies.</text>

			<text class='h1'>Spiritual Dullness of the Hebrews</text>
			<text class='p'>1. Lack of growth in knowledge 5:11-14</text>
			<text class='p'>The writer of Hebrews is enthusedwith his subject but he becomes disturbed because of the Spiritual immaturity of his audience. Jesus was called of God an High Priest after the order ofMelchizedek (5:10)&#44; a truth filled with meaning to be expounded in chapter 7. Much is to be said&#44; but the Christians are (dull of hearing&#44; 5:11)&#44; immatureand therefore not prepared to receive instruction.</text>
			<text class='p'>Immature Christians not only hurtthemselves&#44; by robbing themselves&#44; of the Spiritual benefits which accompanymaturity&#44; but they rob others also. Christians should be &quot;teachers&quot; (5:12)&#44;sharing their Spiritual blessings with others both within and without thechurch.  It is the entire church that has been called to a teaching ministry.(Matt. 28:19&#44; The Great Commission includes the command &quot;teach all nations.&quot;) Some Christians have and are special gifts to the church. (Eph. 4:11&#44;12)</text>
			<text class='p'>Instead of being teachers&#44; however&#44;the immature Christians had need that one teach them again &quot;the firstprinciples of the oracles of God&quot; (5:12). Teachers who should be reaching thelost must spend their time reinstructing the immature. You have let slip fromyou the elementary truths of God&apos;s Holy Word! If this is so&#44; then truly youmust be taught again. (John 5:39) He warned us against this. (2:1)</text>
			<text class='p'>The plea continues (5:13-14) youshould move on (not back up) from the milk stage to the meat stage. We are commandedto &quot;grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior JesusChrist. (II Peter 3:18) &quot;Growing up into Him in all things (Eph. 4:15). Paulsaid&#44; &quot;When I became a man&#44; I put away childish things.&quot; (I Cor. 13:11) &quot;Brethren be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children&#44;but in understanding be men.&quot; (I Cor. 14:20)</text>
			<text class='p'>The milk drinker is &quot;unskillful inthe word of Righteousness.&quot; (5:13) We should cherish the milk.</text>
			<text class='p'>  - &quot;The first principles of theoracles of God.&quot; 5:12</text>
			<text class='p'>  - &quot;The principles of the doctrineof Christ.&quot; 6:1</text>
			<text class='p'>  - The rudiments of Christianfaith.&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>  - &quot;The facts of God&apos;s grace inChrist.</text>
			<text class='p'>Remember&#44; milk is not to be givenconstantly. All should rest in the great truth of God&apos;s love and theredemption wrought by Christ at Calvary&#44; and then move on to maturity. (A lifeof service.)</text>

			<text class='p'>The strong meat Christian is mature(5:14) &quot;by <u>reason of use</u> have their senses exercised to discern bothgood and evil. The babe will be a disinterested spectator in the battlebetween truth and error&#44; but mature Christians will be an active participant. The Hebrews were rooting for a side of truth&#44; but they had not joined thebattle for truth. Babies are excused from fighting&#44; but (meat eaters) matureChristians should be where the going is rough. The Christian is called to puton all the armor of God (Eph. 6:11) and fight the fight of faith. &quot;Fight the <u>good</u>fight of faith and lay hold on eternal life.&quot; (I Tim. 6:12) The distinctionbetween good and evil (5:14) involves more than theology. It is &quot;by reason ofuse&quot; that the &quot;senses are exercised to discern both good and evil.&quot;</text>
			<text class='p'>Since the milk Christian (if youplease) is unable to enter the battle&#44; he is forced to act like a child &quot;tossedto and fro&#44; and carried about with every wind of doctrine&#44; by the sleight ofman and of cunning craftiness&#44; whereby they lie in wait to deceive.&quot; (Eph.4:14) Through the process of growing&#44; our ability to discern matures.</text>

			<text class='p'>The Christian has seen himself as asinner who has broken the law of God. He has seen his sin as an offense toGod. The very goodness of God leads us to repentance. (Rom. 2:4) Thisrepentance involves a turning away from dead works which are not the fruit ofthe Spirit of the living Christ. The works of the unbeliever are dead and evil</text>

			<text class='p'> Read Heb. 7:1-21 Heb. 5:1-11 Gen.14:18-20</text>
			<text class='p'>This gives the history of Christrevealing Himself to Abram. Christ came in the form of a man like many othertimes&#44; not in the flesh but in the Spirit&#44; revealed to Abram. He came withbread and wine. The bread and wine is symbolic of Christ&apos;s sufferings on thecross. The two great miracles that Jesus performed were the turning of waterinto wine and the multiplying of the 2 fish and 5 loaves of bread.</text>
			<text class='p'>Wine &mdash; John 2:1-11</text>
			<text class='p'>Bread &mdash; John 6:1-14 Matt.14:14-21 Mark 6:30-44 Luke 9:12-17</text>
			<text class='p'>The miracles were signs of who Heis and what He came to do. Christ knew who He was (Heb. 5:6&#44;10) and what He wassent to do. (John 17:6-8&#44;18)</text>
			<text class='p'>We must keep His word and be likeHim and do as He has done. Any and every true believer can have a manifestationof God&apos;s Spirit in their life (wine) but it will take a close follower ofChrist to gather fragments of truth (bread).</text>

			<text class='h3'>3 The High Priest by virtue of His office approached God with a sacrifice.Prayer and sacrifice were his prime responsibilities. The prophet stood beforethe people as God&apos;s representative. The priest stood before God representingthe people.</text>
			<text class='h3'>4 Heaven is the place of Christ&apos;s high priestly ministry. 8:1 &quot;In theheavens&quot;</text>
			<text class='h4'>a. He was concerned with the throne of majesty while the earthly priestworked among the likeness and types and shadows. 8:45 The earthly is only apattern of the heavenly. The Christ is our Heavenly Priest.</text>
			<text class='h4'>b. Christ is a direct revelation from Heaven in the person of Jesus. John1:14 &quot;He dwelt&quot; tabernacled among men that bore witness of His glory. Jesus isthe substance of what the earthly tabernacle was a shadow. Jesus is not areflection of Heavenly reality&#44; but is the SON OF GOD &mdash; Emanuel&#44; God with us.</text>
			<text class='h4'>c. &quot;The Sum&quot; 8:1&#44; 4&#44; 6&#44; 12.
