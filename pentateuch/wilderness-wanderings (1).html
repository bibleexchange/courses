<blockquote><span lang='en'>Numbers 19:2 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORDhath commanded&#44; saying&#44; Speak unto the children of Israel&#44; that they bring theea red heifer without spot&#44; wherein is no blemish&#44; and upon which never cameyoke: </span><span lang='swa'>Hes19:2 Hii ndiyo amri ya sheria Bwana aliyoagiza&#44; akisema&#44; Waambie wana wa Israeli wakuletee ng'ombe mke mwekundu asiye na kipaku&#44; mkamilifu&#44; ambaye hajatiwa nira bado; </span></blockquote>

<p><span lang='en'>This chapter is only concerning the preparing and using of the ashes which were to infuse the water of purification. The people had complained of the strictness of the law&#44; which forbade their near approach to the tabernacle&#44; </span><span lang='swa'>Hii ni Sura pekee kuhusu kujiandaa na kutumika kwa watumishi ambao walikuwa wamenyweshwa maji ya utakaso.Watu walilalamika kwa ajili ya shurutu ya sheria&#44; ambayo ilizuia kukaribia kwa kwenye hemaya kukutania&#44; </span></p>

<blockquote><span lang='en'>Num. 17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying? </span><span lang='swa'>Hes. 17:13 Kila mtu akaribiaye&#44; aikaribiayemaskani ya Bwana&#44; hufa; je! Tutakufa pia sote? </span></blockquote>

<p><span lang='en'>In answer to this complaint&#44; they are here directed to purify themselves&#44; so as that they might come as far as they had occasion without fear. </span><span lang='swa'>Jibu katika malalamiko haya&#44;wako hapa kwa kuelekezwa kujitakasa wao wenyewe&#44;kwa hiyo basi wakaribia kwa mbali walikuwa na furusa isio kuwa woga. </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>The method of preparing these ashes&#44; by the burning of a red heifer&#44; with a great deal of ceremony&#44; Numbers 19:1-10. </span><span lang='swa'>Njia ya kuwaandaa hawa watenda kazi&#44;kwa njia ya kuteketeza ng 9ombe mke mwekundu&#44;pamoja na shughuli kubwa ya sikukuu&#44;Hes19:1-10. </span></h3>

<h3><span lang='en'>The way of using them. </span><span lang='swa'>Njia ya kuzitumia. </span></h3>
<h4><span lang='en'>They were designed to purify persons from the pollution contracted by a dead body&#44; Nu 19:11-16. </span><span lang='swa'>Zilibuniwa kutakasa watu kutoka kwenye uchafu uliogusana na maiti&#44;Hes 19:11-16. </span></h4>
<h4><span lang='en'>They were to be put into running water (a small quantity of them)&#44; with which the person to be cleansed must bepurified&#44; Nu 19:17-22. And that this ceremonial purification was a type andfigure of the cleansing of the consciences of believers from the pollutions of sin appears by the apostle's discourse&#44; (Heb 9:13&#44;14)&#44; where he compares theefficacy of the blood of Christ with the sanctifying virtue that was in&quot;the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean.&quot; </span><span lang='swa'>Ilikuwa watupiwe kwenye maji yanayo kimbia (sifa yao ndogo)&#44; ni pamoja na kile ambacho ili mtu aweze kuwa safi ni lazima kutakaswa&#44;Hes 19:17-22.huo ni utakaso wa sherehe ilikuwa ni aina na picha ya kutakaswa kwa dhamiri za waamini kutoka kuchafu wa dhambi kutokea kwa mazunguzo ya mtume(Waeb 9:13&#44;14)&#44;mahali anapo linganisha na damu yenye thamani ya Kristo pamoja na maadili ya kutakaswa ambayo yalikuwa katika majivu ya ng 9ombe wa kunyunyiza aliye najisi </span></h4>

<p><span lang='en'>In Numbers 19:1-10&#44; We have here the divine appointment concerning the solemn burning of a red heifer to ashes&#44;and the preserving of the ashes&#44; that of them might be made&#44; not a beautifying&#44;but a purifying&#44; water&#44; for that was the utmost the law reached to; it offered not to adorn as the gospel does&#44; but to cleanse only. This burning of theheifer&#44; though it was not properly a sacrifice of atonementfor wrong done&#44; being not performed at the altar&#44; yet was typical of thedeath and sufferings of Christ&#44; by which he intended&#44; not only to satisfy God'sjustice&#44; but to purify and pacify our consciences&#44; that we may have peace withGod and also peace in our own bosoms&#44; to prepare for which Christ died&#44; notonly like the bulls and goats at the altar&#44; but like the heifer without thecamp. </span><span lang='swa'>Katika Hes 19:1-10&#44; Hapa tuna maafikiano ya kiungu kuhusu ng 9ombe jike mwekundu wa kuteketeza kwa ajili ya sherehe kwa majivu na utunzaji wa majivu&#44;yatokanayo na hao wanyama&#44;sio kumfanya awe mzuri bali kutakasa maji kwaajili ya kile ambacho kilikuwa ni kufikia kwa kipeo cha sheria;ilitolewa sio kwa kuremba kama injli ifanyavyo&#44;bali ni kwa kutasa tu. Hii kuteketezwa kwa huyu ng 9ombe jike&#44;ingawa hakuwa dhabihu maalumu ya kulipia kosa kwa ajili ya uovu uliofanyika&#44;ilikuwa haifanyiki madhabahuni&#44;ndio bado ilikuwa ni picha ya kifo na mateso ya Kristo&#44;kwa kile alichokusudia&#44;sio tu kusitahili haki ya Mungu&#44; bali ni kutakasa na tuliza dhamiri zetu&#44;ilituweze kuwa naamani na Mungu na katika vifua vyetu wenyewe&#44;kujiandaa kwa kile Kristo alicho chofia&#44;sio tu kama mafahali na mbuzi madhabahuni&#44;lakini ni kama ng 9ombe jike pasipo kambi. </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>I.There was a great deal of care employed in the choice of the heifer that was to be burnt&#44; much more than in the choice of any other offering&#44; </span><span lang='swa'>I.Kulikuwa na shughuli kubwa ya kutunza wajiriwa katika uchaguzi wa ng 9ombe jike aliyesitahili kuteketezwa&#44;kulikuwa na mambo mengi zaidi kuliko sadaka yeyote&#44; </span></h3>

<blockquote><span lang='en'>Num. 19:2 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORDhath commanded&#44; saying&#44; Speak unto the children of Israel&#44; that they bring theea red heifer without spot&#44; wherein is no blemish&#44; and upon which never cameyoke: </span><span lang='swa'>Hes. 19:2 Hili ni agizo la sheria ambayo Bwana aliamuru&#44;kusema&#44;Sema na wana waisrael&#44;kwamba wataleta ng 9ombe jike mwekundu asiye na doa&#44;mahali pasipo na lawama&#44; na kuhusu Yule ambayo hatakaa afungwe: </span></blockquote>

<h4><span lang='en'>a.It must not only be without blemish&#44; typifying the spotless purity and sinless perfection of the Lord Jesus&#44; </span><span lang='swa'>a.Si lazima tu asie na lawama&#44;kulinganisha na usafi usio na doa na ukamilifu usiokuwa dhambi wa Bwana Yesu &#44; </span></h4>

<h4><span lang='en'>b.It must be a red heifer&#44; because of the rarity of the colour&#44; that it might be the more remarkable: the Jews say&#44; </span><span lang='swa'>b.Lazima awe ng 9ombe jike mwekundu&#44;kwa sababu ya uadimifu wa rangi&#44;ambayo angeweza kuwekewa alama zaidi:wayahudi husema&#44; </span></h4>

<p><span lang='en'>&quot;If but two hairs were black or white&#44; it was unlawful.&quot; </span><span lang='swa'>Kama kuna manyoya mawili meusi au meupe&#44;hafai. </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>Christ&#44; as man&#44; was the Son of Adam&#44; red earth&#44; and we find him red in his apparel&#44; red with his own blood&#44; and red with the blood of hisenemies. </span><span lang='swa'>Kristo&#44; kama mtu alikuwa mwana wa Adamu undongo mwekundu&#44;tuna mkuta mwekundu katika mwonekano wake&#44;mwekundu pamoja na damu yake&#44;wekundu pamoja na damu ya maadui zake. </span></p>

<h4><span lang='en'>c.It must be one on which never came yoke&#44; which was not insisted on in other sacrifices&#44; but thus was typified the voluntary offer of the Lord Jesus&#44; whenhe said&#44; Lo&#44; I come&#44; He was bound and held with no other cords than those ofhis own love. This heifer was to be provided at the expense of thecongregation&#44; because they were all to have a joint interest in it; and so allbelievers have in Christ. </span><span lang='swa'>c.Lazima iwemoja katika kile ambacho kamwe haikaa iwena mafungamano&#44;ambayo haikushikilia kwenye dhabihu nyingine&#44; bali ile iliokuwa sadaka ya hiari ya Bwana Yesu&#44;wakati aliposema&#44;ahaa nakuja&#44;alifungwa na hakushikiliwa na njia zingine za miti zaidi ya zile za upendo wake.Huyu ng 9ombe jike mwekundu alikuwa anaandaliwa kwenye nafasi ya kusanyiko&#44;kwa sababu wote walikuwa wawe na uwekezeji uliowekwa ndani yake;na kwa sababu hiyo basi na waamini wote wawe ndani ya Kristo 1839 </span></h4>

<h3><span lang='en'>II.There was to be a great deal of ceremony in the burning of it. The care of doing it was committed to Eleazar&#44; not to Aaron himself&#44; because it was notfit that he should do anything to render himself ceremonially unclean&#44; no&#44; notso much as till the evening Num. 19:3;:Num. 19:8; yet it being an affair ofgreat concern especially in the significancy of it&#44; it was to be performed byhim that was next to Aaron in dignity. The chief priests of that time had theprincipal hand in the death of Christ. </span><span lang='swa'>II.Kulikuwa na shughuli kubwa katika sherehe ya kumteketezahuyo ng 9ombe. Utuzaji wa kumshughulikia ulikabidhiwa kwa Eliezari&#44;sio kwa Haruni peke yake&#44;kwasababu haingekuwa sawa kwamba angefanya kitu chochote kujilipia mwenyewe kilicho najisi kwenye sherehe&#44;hapana&#44;haikuwa hivyo mpaka jioni Hes 19:3;:19:8;na bado itakuwa nijambo la kuhusika sana na maalumukatika umuhimu wake&#44; ilikuwa ifanywe na yeye na kwamba baadaye kwa Haruni katika heshima. Makuhani wakuu wa wakati huo walikuwa mkono wa sheria katika kifo cha Kristo. </span></h3>

<h4><span lang='en'>The heifer was to be slain without the camp&#44; as an impure thing&#44; which identifies the insufficiency of the methods prescribed by the ceremonial law to take awaysin. So far were they from cleansing effectually that they were themselvesunclean; as if the pollution that was laid upon them continued to cleave tothem. Yet&#44; to answer this type&#44; our Lord Jesus&#44; being made sin and a curse forus&#44; suffered without the gate&#44; Heb 13:12. </span><span lang='swa'>Ng 9ombe jike alikuwa achinjwe pasipo kambi&#44;kama kitu kisio safi ambacho kinatambulika kisio na maana ya njiazilizo amuriwa kwa sheria za kisikukuu kuondoa dhambi. Mpaka hapo walitoka katika kutakaswa kutokana na madhara ambayo yaliwanajisi; kama ule uchafu uliokuwa umewekwa juu yao ulioendelea kuwatenga. Na bado katika kujibu swali la aina hii&#44;Bwana wetu Yesu&#44;amefanywa kuwa dhambi na laana kwa ajili Yetu&#44;aliteswa inje ya lango&#44;Waebr 13:12. </span></h4>

<h4><span lang='en'>Eleazar was to sprinkle the blood directly before the door of the tabernacle&#44; and looking steadfastly towards it&#44; </span><span lang='swa'>Eleazari alikuwa akinyunyiza damu moja kwa moja mbele ya lango la hema ya kukutania&#44;na kutafuta mahali kwa haraka mbele yake&#44; </span></h4>

<blockquote><span lang='en'>Nu 19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger&#44; and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times: </span><span lang='swa'>Hes 19:4 Na Eliazari kuhani atachukua damukwa kidole chake&#44;na kuinyunyiza damu moja kwa moja mbele ya hema ya kukutania ya kusanyiko mara saba: </span></blockquote>

<p><span lang='en'>This made it in some sort an expiation; for the sprinkling of the blood before the Lord was the chief solemnity in all the sacrifices ofatonement; therefore&#44; though this was not done at the altar&#44; yet&#44; being donetowards the sanctuary&#44; it was closely relatedthat the virtue and validity of it depended upon the sanctuary&#44; and werederived from it. This signified the satisfaction that was made to God by thedeath of Christ&#44; our great high priest&#44; who by the eternal Spirit (and theSpirit is called the finger of God&#44; (Luke 11:20) offered himself without spotunto God; directly before the sanctuary&#44; when he said&#44; Father&#44; into thy hands Icommit my spirit. It also signifies how necessary it was to the purifying ofour hearts that satisfaction should be made to divine justice. This sprinklingof the blood put virtue into the ashes. </span><span lang='swa'>"Huu ufanywaji uko katika aina ya mwisho;kunyunyiza damu mbele za Bwana ilikuwa sherehe kuu katika dhabihu za malipo ya kosa;ingawa hii ilikuwa haifanyiki madhabahuni&#44;bado ilifanyika mbele ya mahali patakatifu&#44;ilikuwa karibu kuhusiana na yale maadili na uthabiti wake uliotegemewa kwenye mahali patakatifu&#44;yaliokuwa yametolewa mahali hapo.Hii iliashiria utakaso ambao Mungu alikuwa ameufanya kwa kifo cha Kristo&#44; kuhani wetu mkuu&#44;ambaye kwa Roho wa milele (na Roho anaitwa kidole cha Mungua&#44; (Luk 11:20) alijitoa mwenyewe pasipo doa kwa Mungu;moja kwa moja mbele ya mahali patakatifu&#44;wakati aliposema Baba mikononi mwako naiweka roho yangu.Hii pia inaonyesha jinsi ulazima ulivyokuwa kwenye utakaso wa mioyo yetu ambayo utakaso ulitakiwa kufanyika kwa haki ya kiungu.Huu unyunyiziaji wa damu uliweka uthibitisho kwenye majivu. </span></p>

<h4><span lang='en'>The heifer was to be wholly burnt&#44; Nu 19:5.</span><span lang='swa'>3. Huyu ng 9ombe jike alikuwa awe dhabihu ya kutekeza yenye kuleta siha&#44; Hes 19:5.</span></p> 
  
 <h4><span lang='en'>This typified the extreme sufferings of our Lord Jesus&#44; both insoul and body&#44; as a sacrifice made by fire. The priest was to cast into thefire&#44; while it was burning&#44; cedarwood&#44; hyssop&#44; and scarlet&#44; which were used inthe cleansing of lepers (Le 14:6&#44;7)&#44; that the ashes of these might be mingledwith the ashes of the heifer&#44; because they were designed for purification. </span><span lang='swa'>Hii ilionyesha mateso ya kiwango cha juu ya Bwana wetu Yesu Kristo&#44; yote katika nafsi na mwili&#44; kama dhabihu iliofanywa kwa moto. Kuhani alikuwa aitupie kwenye moto&#44;wakati ilipokuwainatekea&#44;mti wa mwerezi&#44;hisopo&#44;sufu nyekundu vilikuwa vinatumika kutakasia wenye ukoma (Wal 14:6&#44;7)&#44; yale majivu yake yangeweza kuchanganywa na majivu ya ng 9ombe jike&#44;kwa yalibuniwa kwa ajili ya utakaso. </span></h4>

<h4><span lang='en'>4. The ashes of the heifer(separated as well as they could from the ashes of the wood wherewith it wasburnt) were to be carefully gathered up by the hand of a clean person&#44; andpounded and sifted&#44; and so laid up for the use of the congregation&#44; (Nu 19:9)&#44;not only for that generation&#44; but for posterity; for the ashes of this oneheifer were sufficient to season as many vessels of water as the people ofIsrael would need for many ages. The Jews say that this one served till thecaptivity&#44; nearly 1000 years&#44; and that there was never another heifer burnttill Ezra's time&#44; after their return&#44; grounded only upon the silence of theirold records in the later times of their church&#44; of which they had more fullrecords&#44; they find eight burnt between Ezra's time and the destruction of thesecond temple&#44; which was about 500 years&#44; These ashes are said to be laid uphere as a purification for sin&#44; because&#44; though they were intended to purifyonly from ceremonial uncleanness&#44; yet they were a type of that purification forsin which our Lord Jesus made by his death. Ashes mixed with water are used inscouring&#44; but these had their virtue purely from the divine institution&#44; andtheir accomplishment and perfection in Christ&#44; who is the end of this law forrighteousness. </span><span lang='swa'>4. Majivu ya ng 9ombe jike(yalitengena vizuri kama yalivyoweza kutoka kwa majivu ya miti ambayo yalichomwa pamoja) walikuwa makini kuyakusanya kwa mkono wa mtu safi&#44;na waliyatwanga na kuyachekecha&#44;na baada ya hapo kuyaweka kwa ajili matumizi kusanyiko la waamini&#44; (Hes 19:9)&#44;sio tu kwa ajili ya kusanyiko &#44;bali kwa ajili ya watoto au vizazi vya baadaye;maana majivu ya huyu ng 9ombe jike alikuwa anatosha kwa nyakati kama vyombo vingi vya maji kadiri watu wa Israel waliovyo hitaji kwa karine nyingi.Wayahudi husema kwamba huyu moja ahudumia hadi utumwani&#44;karibu miaka 1000&#44;tangu hapo hapakuwa tena na ng 9ombe mwingine jike kutekezwa mpaka wakati wa Ezra&#44;baada ya kurudi kwao&#44;ilicheleweshwa tu juu ya ukimya wa habari za wajibu wao katika wakati baadaye wa kanisa lao&#44; wa kile ambacho walikuwa na habari za kutosha&#44; walipata sadaka nane za kutekezwa kati ya wakati wa Ezra na maangamizi ya hekalu la pili&#44;ambalo lilikuwa karibu na miaka 500&#44;Majivu haya yalisemwa yawekwe mpaka hapa kama utakaso kwa ajili ya dhambi&#44;kwa sababu&#44;ingawa walikusudiwa kutakaswa tu kutoka kwenye unajisi wa sherehe&#44;bado walikuwa ni aina ya utakaso kwa ajili ya dhambi ambayo Bwana wetu Yesu aliifanya kwa kifo chake.Majivu yaliyochanganywa na maji yalitumiwa kungarisha&#44;lakini hivi vilikuwa ni uthibisho wao kwa usafi kutoka sheria ya kiungu&#44; na utimilifu wao na ukamilifu katika Kristo&#44;ambayo ni mwisho wa hii sheriakwa ajili ya haki. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>a. That the water of purification was made so by the ashes of a heifer&#44; whose blood was sprinkled before thesanctuary; so that which cleanses our consciences is the abiding virtue of thedeath of Christ; it is his blood that cleanses from all sin&#44; 1Jo 1:7. </span><span lang='swa'>a. Yale maji ya uchafu yalikuwa yafanywe kwa majivu ya ng 9ombe jike&#44;ambaye damu yake ilinyunyizwa mbele ya mahali patakatifu;kwa hiyo ndivyo husafisha dhamiri zetu uthibitisho unaodumu wakifo cha Yesu;ni damu yake ndiyo inayo safisha kutoka dhambi zote 1Yoh 1:7. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>b.. That the ashes were sufficient for all the people. There needed not to be a fresh heifer slain for everyperson or family that had occasion to be purified&#44; but this one was enough forall&#44; even for the strangers that sojourned among them (Nu 19:10); so there isvirtue enough in the blood of Christ for all that repent and believe thegospel&#44; for every Israelite&#44; and not for their sins only&#44; but for the sins ofthe whole world&#44; 1Jo 2:2. </span><span lang='swa'>b.. Hayo majivu yalikuwa ushahidi kwa ajiliya watu wote. Haikuhitajika ng 9ombe mzuri wakuchinja kwa ajili ya kila mtu au familia ambayo ilikuwa na nafasi ya kutakaswa&#44;bali huyu moja alitosha kwa wote&#44;hata kwa wageni waliwatembelea miongoni mwao (Hes 19:10); kwa hiyo kuna uthibitisho wakutosha katika damu ya Kristo kwa ajili wote ambao wametubu na kuamini injili&#44;kwa kila mwuisrael&#44;sio kwa ajili ya dhambi zao tu&#44;bali kwa ajili ya dhambi za ulimwengu mzima 1Yoh 2:2. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>c. That these ashes were capable of being preserved without waste to many ages. No bodily substance is soincorruptible as ashes are&#44; these a very fit emblem of the everlasting efficacyof the sacrifice of Christ. He is able to save&#44; and able to cleanse&#44; to theuttermost. </span><span lang='swa'>c. Kwa hiyo haya majivu yalikuwa na uwezo wa kutunzwa bila kuharibika kwa karine nyingi.Hakuna hali ya kimwili ambayo ingeharibiwa kama hayo majivu&#44;hii iko sawa na ishara ya matokeo ya milele ya dhabihu ya Kristo.Yeye anaweza kuokoa&#44;na aweza kusafisha&#44;hata mwisho&#44; </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>d. These ashes were laid up as a stock or treasure&#44; for the constant purification of Israel from theirpollutions; so the blood of Christ is laid up for us in the word as aninexhaustible fountain of merit&#44; to which by faith we may have recourse dailyfor the purging of our consciences; see Zec 13:1. </span><span lang='swa'>d. Haya majivu yalihifadhiwa kwenye hazina&#44;kwa jili ya utakaso wa daima wa Israel kutoka uchafu wao;kwa hiyo damu ya Kristo iliwekwa kwa ajili yetu katika neno kama bubujiko lisilo isha la kiapo cha usitahilifu&#44; kwahilo kwa imani tunaweza kuwa msaada wa kila siku kwa ajili ya kutakaswa kwa dhamiri zetu;tazama Zek 13:1. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>e. All those that were employed in this service were made ceremonially unclean by it; even Eleazar himself&#44; thoughhe did but sprinkle the blood&#44; Nu 19:7. He that burned the heifer was unclean(Nu 19:8)&#44; and he that gathered up the ashes (Nu 19:10); so all that had a handin putting Christ to death contracted guilt by it: his betrayer&#44; hisprosecutors&#44; his judge&#44; his executioner&#44; all did what they did with wickedhands&#44; though it was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God (Ac2:23); yet some of them were&#44; and all might have been cleansed by the virtue ofthat same blood which they had brought themselves under the guilt of. Some makethis to signify the imperfection of the legal services&#44; and their insufficiencyto take away sin&#44; inasmuch as those who prepared for the purifying of otherswere themselves polluted by the preparation. The Jews say&#44; This is a mysterywhich Solomon himself did not understand&#44; that the same thing should pollutethose that were clean and purify those that were unclean. </span><span lang='swa'>e. Wote walioajiriwa katika huduma hii walifanywa kwa utaratibu wa sherehe ya walionajisika;hata Eliezari mwenyewe&#44;ingawa yeye alinyunyiza damu&#44;Hes19:7.Yeye ambaye alimteketeza ng 9ombe jike aliyekuwa najisi(Hes 19:8)&#44; nay eye alikusanya majivu(Hes 19:10); kwa hiyo yote aliokuwa ni kumweka Kristo katika kifo kilichopingana na hatia kwa hayo: msaliti wake&#44;watesi wakeh hakimu wake&#44; kazi za utendaji wake&#44;wote walifanya kile walicho fanya kwa mikono miovu&#44; ingawa ilikuwa kwa shauri thabiti na kwa ukiri wa Mungu(Mat 2:23);bado baadhi yao walikuwa&#44;na wote waweze kutakaswa kwa uthibitisho wa kile wa damu hiyohiyo ambayo wao waliileta wao wenyewe chini ya hatia ya.baadhi hufanya hii kuashiria kutokukamilika kwa hudumu kubwa&#44; na kutoridhika kwao kwa kuondolewa dhambi&#44;kama ilivyo kwa wale waliandaliwa kwa ajili ya utakaso wa wengine waliojichafua wenyewe kwa maandalizi. Wayahu husema&#44;hii ni siri ambayo Sulemani mwenyewe hakuifahamu&#44;ambayo nikitu kilele ambacho kingewachafua wale waliokuwa safi na kutakasa wale ambao walikuwa najisi. </span></p>
