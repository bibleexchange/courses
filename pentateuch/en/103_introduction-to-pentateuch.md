<h2><span lang='en'>This is the Old Testament Bookshelf. </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>The word &quot;testament&quot; means &quot;will&quot; or &quot;covenant.&quot; The term &quot;Old Testament&quot;&#44; therefore&#44; refers to God&apos;s covenant or promise-law to bless mankind through the Jewish nation. It has also come to refer to the writings about the Old Covenant&#44; although&#44; strictly speaking&#44;these ancient books are the Old Covenant Scriptures. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The Scriptures of the Old Testament record the story of God&apos;s chosen people&#44; Israel&#44; and their relationship to His covenant to bless all nations through them. </span></p>

<h2><span lang='en'>The Books of Law </span></h2>
<h3><span lang='en'>There are Two Titles of the Books of the Law</span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'>The five books of the Law (Jewish name: Torah) are also called &ldquo;the Pentateuch&rdquo;(a Greek name) which means &ldquo;five scrolls.&rdquo; At least some of this literature if not all was written by Moses (Luke 24:27; John 5:46). These books describe the creation of the world&#44; God&rsquo;s call to the Hebrews to be His special people&#44;their captivity and release from Egypt&#44; the laws which guided them on their way to the Promised Land and how God blessed the people when they obeyed and disciplined them when they disobeyed. </span></p>
<h3><span lang='en'>This is the Order of Events and People in the Pentateuch </span></h3>
<h4><span lang='en'>Creation of All Things</span></h4>
<h4><span lang='en'>The Book of Genesis: 4004 B.C. to 1800 B.C. </span></h4>
<h4><span lang='en'>The Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden</span></h4>

<p><span lang='en'>NOTE: All dates are approximate. </span></p>
<h2><span lang='en'>The Dramatic Story of Redemption Begins in the Pentateuch</span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>A superficial reading of the Bible shows it to be a collection of sixty-six books written during a period of about 1600 years by about forty different men&#44; among who were kings&#44; prophets&#44; priests&#44; a scribe, a shepherd&#44; and fishermen. It may appears to be a library rather than one book, but a closer look at the Bible reveals it to be a unified work. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Through the many stories and varied subject matter of the Scriptures runs one outstanding and predominant theme&mdash;the Redemption of mankind through a Divinely appointed Savior (and this is evidence to the fact that all the authors were under the direction of one Author&mdash;the Holy Ghost.) This unity of the Scriptures is a stark contrast to the Islamic Koran&#44; which consists of a collection of 114 unrelated chapters organized according to their length (with the exception of Sura 1). </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The story of Redemption is a dramatic story&#44; and not dead&#44; boring&#44; hastily combined pieces of literature. The Pentateuch sets the scene and palette for the entire picture of Biblical revelation. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>(Gen. 3:15; 6:18; Ex.12:13; Lev. 1:5; Num. 19:1-10; Deut. 1:8; Luke 24:27) </span></p>
<h2><span lang='en'>General Details of the Pentateuch </span></h2>

<p><span lang='en'>Pentateuch means &ldquo;5 Scrolls&rdquo; and is the Greek name given to the first five books of the Bible by the translators. These 5 books are known by the Jews as &ldquo;The Torah&rdquo; which means The Law. The Pentateuch is part of the Old Testament. &ldquo;Testament&rdquo; means will or covenant. This covenant was one of shadows and promises of better things to come. (Hebrews 8:6-13) </span></p>
<blockquote><span lang='en'>Hebrews 12:24&mdash;And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant&#44; and to the blood of sprinkling&#44; that speaketh better things than that of Abel. </span></blockquote>
<h2><span lang='en'>A Description of each book of the Pentateuch </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'><strong>GENESIS</strong> is the book of origins&mdash;of the beginning of life&#44; and of ruin through sin. Its first phrase &quot;in the beginning God created&quot; is in striking contrast to its last phrase &quot;in a coffin in Egypt.&quot; </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'><strong>EXODUS</strong> is the book of Redemption&mdash;the first need of a ruined race. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'><strong>LEVITICUS</strong> is the book of worship and communion&#44; which is the proper exercise of the redeemed. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'><strong>NUMBERS</strong> speaks of the experiences of a pilgrim people passing through a hostile scene to a promised inheritance. </span></p>
 <p><span lang='en'><strong>DEUTERONOMY</strong> is retrospective and prospective. It is a book of instruction for the redeemed about to enter into their inheritance. (Retrospective &mdash; relating to things of the past. Prospective &mdash; relating to things of the future.) &quot;Remember&quot;is the key word. </span></p>
<h2><span lang='en'>Authorship of the Pentateuch </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>At least some of the Pentateuch if not all was written by Moses and the Pentateuch is without question Divinely inspired Scripture. The Pentateuch&rsquo;s authenticity<a href='#footnotes'>[1] </a>is attested by the most indisputable evidence&#44; and it is cited as an inspired record thirty-three times in the course of the Scriptures. <a href='#footnotes'>[2]</a></span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The author of the Pentateuch is nowhere designated in the collection itself. The testimony of the Bible&#44; however&#44; is that Moses was the writer of the majority of the Pentateuch.</span></p>
<h3><span lang='en'>Passages Confirming this Conclusion </span></h3>
<h4><span lang='en'>Exodus 17:14 Moses&#44; Write this&hellip;in a book </span></h4>
<h4><span lang='en'>John 1:45 Moses&hellip;did write </span></h4>
<h4><span lang='en'>John 5:46 Moses&hellip;he wrote of Me </span></h4>
<h4><span lang='en'>Mark 12:26; 2 Chr. 25:4; Neh.13:1 book of Moses </span></h4>
<h3><span lang='en'>EXCEPTION: Deuteronomy 34 almost definitely was not written by Moses. </span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'>(REASONING: Concerns his death and what took place following his death.)<a href='#footnotes'> [3]</a></span></p>
<h2><span lang='en'>Depth of the Pentateuch </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>The Pentateuch is not merely a record of happenings&#44; but in thePentateuch we have a true and logical introduction to the entire Bible&#44; and an epitome<a href='endNotes'>[4] </a>of the Divine revelation. The Pentateuch introduces in their embryonic stage such doctrines as: </span></p><ul>
<li><span lang='en'>The Nature of God. God is the Source of all Things (Gen. 1:1) </span></li>
<li><span lang='en'>The Nature of Man. Man is Sinful (Gen.3:6; 4:8) </span></li>
<li><span lang='en'>The Nature of Satan. Satan is a Liar (Gen.3:4) </span></li>
<li><span lang='en'>The Nature of Sin. Sin brings Death (Gen.2:17) </span></li>
<li><span lang='en'>The Nature of Salvation. Salvation through the Cross. (Numbers 21:4-9) </span></li></ul>

<h2><span lang='en'>Historical Precedence </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>Babylonian and Assyrian monuments contain records bearing a grotesque resemblance to the majestic account ofCreation and of The Flood. Dennis Bratcher of CRI has observed&#44; &quot;&hellip;there aresimply too many similarities between the accounts to deny any relationship between the accounts.&quot; This fact confirms rather than invalidates Divine inspiration of the Mosaic account. Some tradition of creation and the Flood would inevitably be handed down in the ancient cradle of the human race. Such tradition&#44; following the order of all tradition&#44; would take on grotesque and mythological features over time&#44; and these abound in the Babylonianrecords. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>An example of such a tradition that has survived the ages is the uEnuma Elish (&quot;When on High&quot;). The uEnumaElish is seven Babylonian clay tablets uncovered in Nineveh (Mosul&#44; Iraq)by Henry Layard in 1849. The uEnuma Elish has about a thousand lines and is recorded in Old Babylonian on seven clay tablets&#44; each holding between 115and 170 lines of text. The tablets give us a good look at the Babylonian world view centered on their patron false god&#44; Marduk. These tablets date back to 7th or 8th century BC but the story contained in it may date as far back as the 12th or even the 14th century BC. </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>It is possible these tablets are older than any copies of Scripture that we have&#44; but this does not mean they are a more reliable record just because they are older. Of necessity&#44; the first task of inspiration would be to supplant the often absurd and childish traditions of men with a revelation of the true history (thePentateuch)&#44; and such history we find in words of matchless grandeur&#44; and in an order which&#44; rightly understood&#44; is absolutely scientific. </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>[5]The Enuma Elish is a Babylonian creation epic. Although it exists only in later copies&#44; it was probably composed at Babylon in the Kassite period to celebrate Babylon's victory (c.1450 BC) over the Sea land. Many of the mythological motifs in the story were borrowed from earlier Canaanite myths about Baal. The text consists of seven tablets. It tells how Marduk&#44; the god of Babylon&#44; was chosen king of the gods to defeat Tiamat&#44; the personified sea representing chaotic evil.sup[5] Copyright (c) 1997 GrolierInteractive Inc </span></p>
