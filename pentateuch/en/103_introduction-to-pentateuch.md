# Introduction

Order of Study: Introduction, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.

## This is the Old Testament Bookshelf

The word "testament" means "will" or "covenant." The term "Old Testament", therefore, refers to God's covenant or promise-law to bless mankind through the Jewish nation. It has also come to refer to the writings about the Old Covenant, although, strictly speaking,these ancient books are the Old Covenant Scriptures.

The Scriptures of the Old Testament record the story of God's chosen people, Israel, and their relationship to His covenant to bless all nations through them.

## The Books of Law

### There are Two Titles of the Books of the Law

The five books of the Law (Jewish name: Torah) are also called “the Pentateuch”(a Greek name) which means “five scrolls.” At least some of this literature if not all was written by Moses (Luke 24:27; John 5:46). These books describe the creation of the world, God’s call to the Hebrews to be His special people,their captivity and release from Egypt, the laws which guided them on their way to the Promised Land and how God blessed the people when they obeyed and disciplined them when they disobeyed.

## The Dramatic Story of Redemption Begins in the Pentateuch

A superficial reading of the Bible shows it to be a collection of sixty-six books written during a period of about 1600 years by about forty different men, among who were kings, prophets, priests, a scribe, a shepherd, and fishermen. It may appears to be a library rather than one book, but a closer look at the Bible reveals it to be a unified work.

Through the many stories and varied subject matter of the Scriptures runs one outstanding and predominant theme—the Redemption of mankind through a Divinely appointed Savior (and this is evidence to the fact that all the authors were under the direction of one Author—the Holy Ghost.) This unity of the Scriptures is a stark contrast to the Islamic Koran, which consists of a collection of 114 unrelated chapters organized according to their length (with the exception of Sura 1).

The story of Redemption is a dramatic story, and not dead, boring, hastily combined pieces of literature. The Pentateuch sets the scene and palette for the entire picture of Biblical revelation.

(Gen. 3:15; 6:18; Ex.12:13; Lev. 1:5; Num. 19:1-10; Deut. 1:8; Luke 24:27)

## General Details of the Pentateuch

Pentateuch means “5 Scrolls” and is the Greek name given to the first five books of the Bible by the translators. These 5 books are known by the Jews as “The Torah” which means The Law. The Pentateuch is part of the Old Testament. “Testament” means will or covenant. This covenant was one of shadows and promises of better things to come. (Hebrews 8:6-13)

> Hebrews 12:24—And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.

## A Description of each book of the Pentateuch

**GENESIS** is the book of origins—of the beginning of life, and of ruin through sin. Its first phrase "in the beginning God created" is in striking contrast to its last phrase "in a coffin in Egypt."

**EXODUS** is the book of Redemption—the first need of a ruined race.

**LEVITICUS** is the book of worship and communion, which is the proper exercise of the redeemed.

**NUMBERS** speaks of the experiences of a pilgrim people passing through a hostile scene to a promised inheritance.

**DEUTERONOMY** is retrospective and prospective. It is a book of instruction for the redeemed about to enter into their inheritance. (Retrospective — relating to things of the past. Prospective — relating to things of the future.) "Remember"is the key word.

## Authorship of the Pentateuch

At least some of the Pentateuch if not all was written by Moses and the Pentateuch is without question Divinely inspired Scripture. The Pentateuch’s authenticity<sup>[1]</sup> is attested by the most indisputable evidence, and it is cited as an inspired record thirty-three times in the course of the Scriptures.<sup>[2]</sup>

The author of the Pentateuch is nowhere designated in the collection itself. The testimony of the Bible, however, is that Moses was the writer of the majority of the Pentateuch.

### Passages Confirming this Conclusion

#### Exodus 17:14 Moses, Write this…in a book

#### John 1:45 Moses…did write

#### John 5:46 Moses…he wrote of Me

#### Mark 12:26; 2 Chr. 25:4; Neh.13:1 book of Moses

### EXCEPTION: Deuteronomy 34 almost definitely was not written by Moses.

(REASONING: Concerns his death and what took place following his death.) <sup>[3]</sup>

## Depth of the Pentateuch

The Pentateuch is not merely a record of happenings, but in thePentateuch we have a true and logical introduction to the entire Bible, and an epitome<sup>[4]</sup> of the Divine revelation. The Pentateuch introduces in their embryonic stage such doctrines as:

- The Nature of God. God is the Source of all Things (Gen. 1:1)
- The Nature of Man. Man is Sinful (Gen.3:6; 4:8)
- The Nature of Satan. Satan is a Liar (Gen.3:4)
- The Nature of Sin. Sin brings Death (Gen.2:17)
- The Nature of Salvation. Salvation through the Cross. (Numbers 21:4-9)

## Historical Precedence

Babylonian and Assyrian monuments contain records bearing a grotesque resemblance to the majestic account ofCreation and of The Flood. Dennis Bratcher of CRI has observed, "…there aresimply too many similarities between the accounts to deny any relationship between the accounts." This fact confirms rather than invalidates Divine inspiration of the Mosaic account. Some tradition of creation and the Flood would inevitably be handed down in the ancient cradle of the human race. Such tradition, following the order of all tradition, would take on grotesque and mythological features over time, and these abound in the Babylonianrecords.

An example of such a tradition that has survived the ages is the uEnuma Elish ("When on High"). The uEnumaElish is seven Babylonian clay tablets uncovered in Nineveh (Mosul, Iraq)by Henry Layard in 1849. The uEnuma Elish has about a thousand lines and is recorded in Old Babylonian on seven clay tablets, each holding between 115and 170 lines of text. The tablets give us a good look at the Babylonian world view centered on their patron false god, Marduk. These tablets date back to 7th or 8th century BC but the story contained in it may date as far back as the 12th or even the 14th century BC.

It is possible these tablets are older than any copies of Scripture that we have, but this does not mean they are a more reliable record just because they are older. Of necessity, the first task of inspiration would be to supplant the often absurd and childish traditions of men with a revelation of the true history (thePentateuch), and such history we find in words of matchless grandeur, and in an order which, rightly understood, is absolutely scientific.

Many of the mythological motifs in the story were borrowed from earlier Canaanite myths about Baal. The text consists of seven tablets. It tells how Marduk, the god of Babylon, was chosen king of the gods to defeat Tiamat, the personified sea representing chaotic evil. Copyright (c) 1997 GrolierInteractive Inc
