# Jacob (25:26-47:31)

Jacob means supplanter, that is, the heel-holder, one who comes behind and catches the heel of his adversary. He was the twin brother to Esau who was the elder. God transformed Jacob the Supplanter into Israel The Prince of God. There was a great process to Jacob's character development and no other Bible character represents more fully the conflict between the lower and higher natures, than Jacob.

Beginning on the downgrade, Jacob's life reaches glorious heights only to sink again into the sordid struggle for gain. Jacob emergences at the very last upon the plane of triumphant faith. in spite of all his weaknesses, no devout reader who studies the history of this man's career can doubt that he was a chosen instrument of God.

## KEY THOUGHTS

There are two key thoughts which open up his life and throw light upon his history:

1. The unhappiness produced by family trouble and polygamy.

This fact is illustrated throughout his entire career.

2. The transforming power of fellowship with God.

This truth shines clearly through all the loftier experiences of this chosen man. In the diagram an attempt is made to illustrate the human and Divine elements manifested in his life. The crooked line marks the mountain peaks and low levels of his career.
