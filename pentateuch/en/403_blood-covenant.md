## THE BLOOD COVENANT

"Blood is found in 66 verses in Leviticus.

### What is a "covenant"?

To the ancient Hebrews, a blood covenant was the most binding, sacred agreement that could be made.

The making of a blood covenant seems to be a universal concept found among all peoples in even the most remote parts of the world. The custom of making blood covenants can be found among American Indians as well as in the deepest most remote parts of Africa. The origin of the blood covenant customs looms somewhere beyond the horizon of known history. The customs surround the making of a blood covenant among Hebrews involved:

#### Exchanging Garments and Swords (I Sam. 18:4)

#### A Blood Sacrifice (Gen. 15:9-17;31:43-54; Jer. 34:18-19)

#### A Memorial Covenant Meal (Gen. 31:54)

### Examples of blood covenants in the Bible
