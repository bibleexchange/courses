## Adam (1:26-5:28)

### The name Adam means earthy; red

**Earthy**: The Lord formed man out of the dust of the earth (Gen. 2:7; 3:9; 18:27). Without God man is just dirt. It was not until God breathed into man the breath of His life that man became aliving soul. We are formed from the ground, but God is the sourceof all ulife. In this lesson we see clearly the futility of humanitywithout God.

**Red**: is possibly a reference to red clay and earth, but also brings our thoughts to blood. The life of the flesh is in the blood… (Lev. 17:11). More important than theblood that pumped through Adam's veins which was affected by sin is theinnocent blood of the Second Adam who would come and destroy the powerof the serpent (Gen 3:15).

### Placed in the Garden of Eden and commanded to dress and keep it. (2:5, 15)

**Eden**: The beautiful paradise that God created was possibly situated somewhere between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads--Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel,& Euphrates (Gen.2:10-14). It is important to note that the Flood may have dramatically rerouted the Euphrates River and the geographic picture we seetoday may be tremendously different from what was before the torrents of thegreat deluge.

**Dress and Keep**: In the garden utopia Adam was not free to lounge 247, but was given great responsibility that accompanied his authority (Gen. 1:26). From this passage we may safelyconclude that labor and work was not the curse following sin, but merely thesweat, difficulty and futility of it (Gen. 3:17-19). Also, part of Adam'sresponsibility was to keep the garden, that is, to protect; guard;preserve and also includes the idea of performing the part of a watchman.There was a serpent operating right under Adam's nose and he didn't even notice until it was too late. We have a great responsibility to take care of and guardthe gifts that God gives us. Let us not be slack in our duty, but watchful (I Peter 5:8).

### Adam and Eve were driven from garden (Gen. 3:22-24)

The commandment was given to Adam.He was not deceived as Eve, but made a wilful choice against God's command (Gen. 2:16,17; I Tim. 2:14).

It was because of his sin that they were driven from the garden and more importantly the close communion Adam enjoyed with God in the garden was lost. Sin separates man from God and bringsspiritual and physical death. Adam lived 930 years. He lived to be acontemporary of Lamech, Noah's father. Although that is a long life by today'sstandard, death was not in God's will. Death is a result of sin.
