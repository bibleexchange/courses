### The Levites Exempted for Tabernacle Service (47-54)

> v.49-Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:

#### KOHATH

Son of Levi (Ge 46:11) and father of theKohathites, who were appointed to carry the ark and sacred utensils of thetabernacle during the journeying (Ex 6:16-24; Nu 4:4-15).

#### GERSHON

The eldest son of Levi, and head of one of the three branches of the Levitical tribe (Ge 46:11; Ex 6:16). The Gershonites encamped west of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and carried its curtains andother parts form station to station (Nu 3:17,25; 4:24-28,38-41; 10:17). Thirteen cities were assigned to them in northern Canaan (Jos 21:6; 1Ch 5:62, 71).

#### MERARI

The youngest of Levi's three sons, born inCanaan, and head of a family of the Levites, Ge 46:11; Ex 6:16; Nu 3:17; 1Ch5:1. In the journey through the wilderness they were charged with theframework of the tabernacle, to carry from one place of encampment to another,and there set it up, Nu 4:29-33; 7:8. Twelve cities were assigned to thembeyond Jordan, Jos 21:7,34-40.

## Census of the Levites (Chapter Three)

> Numbers 3:39-All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses andAaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, allthe males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.

Adam Clarke's Commentary:

> This total does not agree with the particulars; for the Gershonites were 7,500, the Kohathites 8,600, the Merarites 6,200, total22,300. Several methods of solving this difficulty have been proposed bylearned men; Dr. Kennicott's is the most simple. Formerly the numbers in theHebrew Bible were expressed by letters, and not by words at full length; and iftwo nearly similar letters were mistaken for each other, many errors in thenumbers must be the consequence. Now it is probable that an error has creptinto the number of the Gershonites, Nu 3:22, where, instead of 7,500, we shouldread 7,200, as K caph, 500, might have been easily mistaken for r resh, 200,especially if the down stroke of the caph had been a little shorter thanordinary, which is often the case in MSS. The extra 300 being taken off, the total is just 22,000, as mentioned in the 39th verse.

### The Firstborn Freed by the Levites (3:40-43)

### The Overplus Redeemed (3:44-51)

### The Law of the Nazarite (6:1-21)

### Cleansing of the Levites (8:1-4)

### Aaron's Lighting of the Candlestick (8:5-22)

### The Age and Time of Levitical Service (8:23-26)

### Special Passover Provisions (9:1-14)

### Following the Cloud and Fire (9:15-23)

### The Two Trumpets of Silver (10:1-10)

The Silver Trumpets speak to us as the voice of God to the assembly (1 Peter 4:11).

> Numbers 10:2--Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.

3. Jubilee/Day of Atonement (Lev. 25:9)
4. Alarm for war (Num. 10:9; 31:6; 1 Cor. 14:8; Jer. 6:17)
