Chapter Three Census of the Levites

Numbers 3:39

All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses andAaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, allthe males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.

Adam Clarke's Commentary:

This total does not agree with the particulars; for theGershonites were 7,500, the Kohathites 8,600, the Merarites 6,200, total22,300. Several methods of solving this difficulty have been proposed bylearned men; Dr. Kennicott's is the most simple. Formerly the numbers in theHebrew Bible were expressed by letters, and not by words at full length; and iftwo nearly similar letters were mistaken for each other, many errors in thenumbers must be the consequence. Now it is probable that an error has creptinto the number of the Gershonites, Nu 3:22, where, instead of 7,500, we shouldread 7,200, as K caph, 500, might have been easily mistaken for r resh, 200,especially if the down stroke of the caph had been a little shorter thanordinary, which is often the case in MSS. The extra 300 being taken off, thetotal is just 22,000, as mentioned in the 39th verse.
