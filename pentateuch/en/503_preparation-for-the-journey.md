<p><span lang='en'>Adam Clarke's Commentary: </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>This total does not agree with the particulars; for theGershonites were 7&#44;500&#44; the Kohathites 8&#44;600&#44; the Merarites 6&#44;200&#44; total22&#44;300. Several methods of solving this difficulty have been proposed bylearned men; Dr. Kennicott's is the most simple. Formerly the numbers in theHebrew Bible were expressed by letters&#44; and not by words at full length; and iftwo nearly similar letters were mistaken for each other&#44; many errors in thenumbers must be the consequence. Now it is probable that an error has creptinto the number of the Gershonites&#44; Nu 3:22&#44; where&#44; instead of 7&#44;500&#44; we shouldread 7&#44;200&#44; as K caph&#44; 500&#44; might have been easily mistaken for r resh&#44; 200&#44;especially if the down stroke of the caph had been a little shorter thanordinary&#44; which is often the case in MSS. The extra 300 being taken off&#44; thetotal is just 22&#44;000&#44; as mentioned in the 39th verse. </span></p>
