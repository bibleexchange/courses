## The Cult that Formed around the legendary Nimrod.<sup>[1]</sup>

Nimrod was married to his own mother, Semiramis, the Queen of Babylon. Satan used them to create a cultso powerful that it spread around the world and multitudes look to Semiramis astheir goddess mother. Nimrod was known by many names including "Moloch." Babies were sacrificed in his honor. (Lev. 18:21; Acts 7:43) At this time, we find thebeginning of confessions, celibacy for priests, & motherinfantworship as we see in Roman Catholicism.

When Nimrod was put to death, the people wept. Semiramis moved quickly and took advantage of the situation. Supposedly a virgin, Semiramis gave birth to another child and claimed that Nimrod had been reincarnated. The child was called Tammuz. He became the sun god, Baal.(Halos)

Semiramis became a goddess with many names. Her names include:Baalti (the Madonna), the GreatGoddess Mother, Queen of Heaven, The Mediatrix, The Mother of Mankind, Astarte,etc. As time went on, monuments of the goddess mother and her child appeared inmany nations. When the people of Babylon were scattered to various parts of theearth, they took with them the worship of the divine mother and child. uTheearth was in darkness.

Around 300 A.D., when RomanCatholicism came into existence, Constantine knew if he would adopt the worship of the goddess mother into their religious system then countless pagans would convert to Roman Catholicism. (Catholic means universal.)
