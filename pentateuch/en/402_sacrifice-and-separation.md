# Sacrifice and Separation (1:1-7:38)

## The Amazing Grace of Substitutional Sacrifice

The reaches of God's grace extend far beyond what the human mind can understand. We are speechless and amazed at the grace and mercy of God. There is no human effort that could be even closelycompared to God's actions of love toward his people. All humanity was guilty ofthe greatest treason against God and yet Christ has positioned himself as oursin bearer and substitute! God has made provision so that the enemy can bebecome friend, the slave can be become a servant of love, and the outcast canbecome a beloved member of the family.

A student of the Bible and humanity must be puzzled with the same question as Nicodemus in John 3:9:

HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE?

"Approved Unto God" (II Tim. 2:15)

"Peace with God" (Rom. 5:1)

"Come boldly unto the throne of grace" (Heb. 4:16)

"Friend of God" (James 2:23)

"Be with Me \[Jesus\]" (Luke 23:43)

"Be Ye Holy" (Lev. 20:7)

## The Purpose of the Old Testament Sacrifices

It is absolutely imperative that it be established in our minds that the redemption and justification of mankind is possible only through the ublood of Jesus.

> Hebrews 9:12-14—Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean,sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall uthe blood ofChrist, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God,purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

In light of Christ's sacrifice on the cross, the "bloody" book of Leviticus comes alive with relevance. Leviticus is not outdated because of Christ's death, but still serves the same purpose as it did before His death. The purpose of the sacrifices of Leviticus and the sum of the Old Testament is to point to Christ.The law is a school master that makes clear definition of right, wrong, and remedy. As we look into this great study of Leviticus, keep in mind that each sacrifice, feast, and ordinance given by God is a portrait of Christ and his dealings with mankind.

## (Whole) Burnt Offering, ch. 1

Acceptable Value Determined by "Pay Grade": herd flock fowl, vs.1,2 The principle is established here early on that God will not require an IMPOSSIBLE thing of his people. The offerings and sacrifices were regulated according to a person's ability and means.

The sin offering atoned for the offender, whereas, the trespass offering atoned only for a specific trespass.The sin offering can be considered as "general redemption" and the "trespassoffering" can be considered a "ransom" for a particular wrong. This provisionmostly involves those sins committed in ignorance. The Trespass Offering is asubclass of the Sin offering. The sin offering was presented at feast days anddone corporately, whereas trespass offerings were not and were morespontaneous.

## The Separation of the People of God

God's people were expected to keep the law of God and live lies free of sin. But, a remedy was in place in the event the law was broken. This remedy ultimately is the atoning blood of Jesus but initially was the sacrifice of animals (beginning back in the garden of Eden) which points toward Christ's ultimate sacrifice.

The priests were to live separate in order to function in their priestly duties. Their very approval into the ministry required an implicit dedication and consecration to God.

In 7:37, the "consecrations"were the sacrifices and offerings which involved the dedication to God's service. The word "consecrations" literally means "a filling up, or filling ofthe hands." In Exodus 29:2, eil milluim , means the ram of filling up.

A persons hands were filled with an offering to present to God, when they were dedicated to God. The word consecration signifies the filling up or filling the hands. These class of offerings were not only for atonement but were also a means for approaching God. (The same principal is loosely paralleled in Esther 4:11.)
