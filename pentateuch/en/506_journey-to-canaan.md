### The Brazen Serpent (Chapter 21)

(John 3:14)

### The Boundaries of Israel's Inheritance (Chapter 34)

All the land was theirs, but they only possessed a portion.

### Cities of Refuge (Numbers 35:6-34; Joshua 20:1-9)

The idea of providing cities of refuge (Joshua 20:1-9) for capital offenses is rooted in the tension between customary tribal law (retaliation or revenge, in which the blood relative isobligated to execute vengeance) and civil law (carried out less personally byan assembly according to a standard code of justice).

Blood feuds are usually associated with nomadic groups;legal procedures, with villages and towns. Israel, found it necessary to adoptan intermediate step regulating manslaughter, so that an innocent person wouldnot be killed before standing trial. Absolution was possible only by beingcleared by his hometown assembly, and by the eventual death of the high priest,which freed the offender from ritual pollution.
