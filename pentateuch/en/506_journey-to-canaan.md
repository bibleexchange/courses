Chapter 21: "The BrazenSerpent" (John 3:14)

The Book of the Wars of the Lord

Numbers 21:14

Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD,What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

Adam Clarke's Commentary:

\[The book of the wars of the Lord\] There are endless conjectures about this book, both among ancients and moderns. Dr. Lightfoot'sopinion is the most simple, and to me bears the greatest appearance of beingthe true one. "This book seems to have been some book of remembrances anddirections, written by Moses for Joshua's private instruction for the managementof the wars after him. See Ex 17:14-16. It may be that this was the same bookwhich is called the book of Jasher, i. e., the book of the upright, or adirectory for Joshua, from Moses, what to do and what to expect in his wars;and in this book it seems as if Moses directed the setting up of archery, see2Sa 1:18, and warrants Joshua to command the sun, and expect its obedience, Jos10:13."

Chapter 34: "The Boundaries of Israel's Inheritance"

All the land was theirs, but they only possessed a portion.

Cities of Refuge

Numbers 35:6-34; Joshua20:1-9

The idea of providing cities of refuge (Joshua 20:1-9) for capital offenses is rooted in the tension between customary tribal law (retaliation or revenge, in which the blood relative isobligated to execute vengeance) and civil law (carried out less personally byan assembly according to a standard code of justice).

Blood feuds are usually associated with nomadic groups;legal procedures, with villages and towns. Israel, found it necessary to adoptan intermediate step regulating manslaughter, so that an innocent person wouldnot be killed before standing trial. Absolution was possible only by beingcleared by his hometown assembly, and by the eventual death of the high priest,which freed the offender from ritual pollution.
