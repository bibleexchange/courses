<p><span lang='en'>Adam Clarke's Commentary: </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>[The book of the wars of the Lord] There are endless conjectures about this book&#44; both among ancients and moderns. Dr. Lightfoot'sopinion is the most simple&#44; and to me bears the greatest appearance of beingthe true one. &quot;This book seems to have been some book of remembrances anddirections&#44; written by Moses for Joshua's private instruction for the managementof the wars after him. See Ex 17:14-16. It may be that this was the same bookwhich is called the book of Jasher&#44; i. e.&#44; the book of the upright&#44; or adirectory for Joshua&#44; from Moses&#44; what to do and what to expect in his wars;and in this book it seems as if Moses directed the setting up of archery&#44; see2Sa 1:18&#44; and warrants Joshua to command the sun&#44; and expect its obedience&#44; Jos10:13.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>All the land was theirs&#44; but they only possessed a portion. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Cities of Refuge </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Numbers 35:6-34; Joshua20:1-9 </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The idea of providing cities of refuge (Joshua 20:1-9) for capital offenses is rooted in the tension between customary tribal law (retaliation or revenge&#44; in which the blood relative isobligated to execute vengeance) and civil law (carried out less personally byan assembly according to a standard code of justice). </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Blood feuds are usually associated with nomadic groups;legal procedures&#44; with villages and towns. Israel&#44; found it necessary to adoptan intermediate step regulating manslaughter&#44; so that an innocent person wouldnot be killed before standing trial. Absolution was possible only by beingcleared by his hometown assembly&#44; and by the eventual death of the high priest&#44;which freed the offender from ritual pollution. </span></p><div class='questons-page'>
