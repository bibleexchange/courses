<h1><span lang='en'>Abraham 11:10-25:18 </span></h1>

<h2><span lang='en'>The Early Life of Abraham </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>Abraham was named Abram at birth (meaning: father of a multitude.) He was the son of Terah and the founding patriarch of the great Hebrew nation. He lived approximately from1996-1822 B.C. His family&#44; a branch of the descendants of Shem&#44; was settled inUr of the Chaldees&#44; beyond the Euphrates. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Terah had two other sons&#44; Nahor and Haran. Haran died in Ur of the Chaldees&#44; leaving a son&#44; Lot. Sometime following Haran&apos;s death&#44; Terah took Abram&#44; with Sarai his wife and his grandsonLot&#44; and emigrated north to the city of Haran in Mesopotamia. Although the nameof his son &quot;Haran&quot; and the name of the city &quot;Haran&quot; are spelled identical inEnglish&#44; they are spelled differently in the Hebrew. Terah died while in Haran.br clear=all </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>After the death of his father&#44;Abram&#44; 75-years-old&#44; with Sarai and Lot&#44; pursued the land of Canaan. It was byDivine direction and command he chose this course when he received the generalpromise that he would become the founder of a great nation in Genesis 12:1-3. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>He passed through the heart of the country by the great highway to Shechem. SichemShechem means &quot;the neck(between the shoulders); the place of burden.&quot; It was in Shechem where hereceived in vision from Jehovah the further revelation that this was the landwhich his descendants should inherit. Abram put his shoulder to the task andbared the responsibility of fulfilling the will of God. The Chrisitan life isnot all ease&#44; but is filled with duty and responsibility. We must take the workof God seriously and with earnestness. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The next halting-place of the sojourner was on a mountain between Bethel and Ai where he built an altar. At the time&#44; the country was suffering from famine and Abram journeyed still southward to therich corn-lands of Egypt. There&#44; fearing that the great beauty of Sarai mighttempt the powerful monarch of Egypt and expose his own life to peril&#44; hearranged that Sarai should call herself his sister. Sarai was probably thedaughter of his brother Haran which made their story at best a &quot;half-truth.&quot;Sarai&apos;s beauty was reported to the king of Egypt&#44; and she was taken into the royal harem. The deception was discovered&#44; and Pharaoh with some indignation dismissed Abram from the country although with great possessions. Accompanied by tag-a-longLot&#44; Abram returned north to southern Palestine to his former encampmentbetween Bethel and Ai. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Eventually&#44; Abram and Lot parted ways. The increased wealth of the two kinsmen was the ultimate cause of their separation. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Genesis13:6&#44;7a--And the land was not able to bear them&#44; that they might dwell together: for their substance was great&#44; so that they could not dwell together.And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen ofLot's cattle: </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Abram gave Lot the choice for a possession of land and he chose the fertile plain of the Jordan near Sodom. Abram continued his journey as a nomad in obedience to God. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Genesis 13:17--Arise&#44;walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>While Abram had pitched his tent in the plain of Mamre (close to Hebron) where he built an altar&#44; Lot was being taken captive by Chedorlaomer king of Elam&#44; who had invaded Sodom. When news ofLot&apos;s abduction reached Abram&#44; he pursued the conquerors and utterly routed thefour kings that had defeated five other kings. God had blessed Abram with thisvictory not very far from Damascus. The captives and plunder were allrecovered&#44; and Abram was greeted on his return by the king of Sodom&#44; and byMelchizedek king of Salem&#44; priest of the Most-High God&#44; who mysteriously appears upon the scene to bless and receive from him a tenth of the spoil. The three-times-repeated promise that his descendants should become a mighty nationand possess the land in which he was a stranger was then confirmed with all thesolemnity of a religious ceremony. Abram refused even a &apos;shoe-latchet&quot; from thespoil of his victory so that none could say &quot;I have made Abram rich.&quot; Abramsecured his blessing from God in refusing every other source. All the glorybelonged to God. </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>Ten years had passed since he had left his father's house&#44; and the fulfilment of the promise was apparently more distant than at first. At the suggestion of Sarai&#44; who despaired of havingchildren of her own&#44; he took as his concubine Hagar. Hagar was Sarai&apos;s Egyptianmaid. Hagar bore Ishmael when Abram was 86 years old. Although Abram now had ason&#44; this was NOT the accomplishment of the Divine promise. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Thirteen years elapsed&#44; during which Abram still dwelt in Hebron&#44; when the covenant was renewed&#44; and the rite of circumcision established as its sign. Here&#44; when he was 99 years old&#44; is Abram&apos;sname was changed to Abraham&#44; (meaning: father of many nations)and Sarai&apos;s name became Sarah. The promise that Sarah should have a sonwas repeated in the remarkable scene described in chapter 18. Three men stoodbefore Abraham as he sat in his tent door in the heat of the day. The patriarch&#44;with true Eastern hospitality&#44; welcomed the strangers&#44; and bade them rest and refresh themselves. The meal ended&#44; they foretold the birth of Isaac&#44; and wenton their way to Sodom. Abraham pleads with God for Sodom and through Abraham&apos;sintercession Lot and his family were saved. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>At length&#44; Isaac&#44; the promised son&#44; was born. Sarah was angered by the mockery of Ishmael at the &quot;great banquet&quot; which Abraham made to celebrate the weaning of his son. In Genesis21:10&#44; Sarah demanded that Ishmael and Hagar should be driven out. </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>Despite the great struggle within his own house&#44; the severest trial of Abraham&apos;s faith was yet to come. For possibly 25-30 years&#44; the Biblical record is silent concerning Abraham&#44; but at lengthhe receives the strange command to take Isaac&#44; his only son&#44; and offer him fora burnt offering at an appointed place. Abraham did not hesitate to obey. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Hebrews 11:17-19--By faith Abraham&#44; when he was tried&#44; offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son&#44; 18 Of whom it was said&#44; That inIsaac shall thy seed be called: 19 Accounting that God was able to raise himup&#44; even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The sacrifice was stayed by the angel of Jehovah&#44; the promise of spiritual blessing was made for the first time&#44; and Abraham with his son returned to Beersheba. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Your treasured possession is never really yours until you have come to the place (Mount Moriah) where you release it to God. Matthew 16:25 </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Isaac was the child of God&apos;s promise. There was no sin in Abraham having him&#44; but Abraham had to be willing to lose him to God&#44; before he couldreally keep him. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Matt.16:25; Eccl. 3:6; Prov.23:26; Psalm 37:4; I Chron. 15:15; Gen. 22:7 </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The Lord required of Abraham that which was PRECIOUS to him.Isaac was the long prayed for and desired son. What is precious to you? (Aposition in ministry? Etc.) </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>V.13&#44;14 Jehovah-jireh the Lord my Provider --Isaac was not to be Abraham&apos;s hope. Abraham&apos;s hope had to rest solely in God. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>For a time&#44; Abraham dwelt inBeersheba&#44; but we find him after a few years in his original residence atHebron&#44; for there Sarah died&#44; and was buried in the cave of Machpelah. Theremaining years of Abraham's life are marked by few incidents. After Isaac'smarriage with Rebekah and his removal to Lahai-roi&#44; Abraham took to wifeKeturah&#44; by whom he had six children&#44; Zimran&#44; Jokshan&#44; Medan&#44; Midian&#44; Ishbokand Shuah&#44; who became the ancestors of nomadic tribes inhabiting the countries south and south-east of Palestine. Abraham lived to see the gradual accomplishment of the promise in the birth of his grandchildren Jacob and Esau&#44;and witnessed their growth to manhood. At the goodly age of 175 he was&quot;gathered to his people&#44;&quot; and laid beside Sarah in the tomb ofMachpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael. </span></p>
