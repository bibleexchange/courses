## Introduction to the book of Numbers

Remember, the Bible is first a spiritual Book. No matter what section of the Holy Scripture we study its highest concernwill always be a spiritual one.

The Bible is useful for business,reliable for history, and a fascinating read, but every precept laid out and recorded account reveals a spiritual lesson:

1. In Genesis, creation is an elaborate revelation of salvation. Christ speaks life and light into our chaos and creates new life.
2. The Hebrew Exodus parallels spiritual deliverance from the bonds of sin and this world.
   3 In Numbers, the Israelites' journey through the wilderness provokes thought concerning the spiritual themes of full reliance upon God and the life lived walking in the Spirit.

The study of the offerings and priesthood is insightfully rich in teaching us how to approach a holy God andour service to Him. The blood of goats point to the Savior Jesus Christ and theinstruction of Moses is council from the ALMIGHTY GOD.

The thirty-six chapters of Numbers journal the details of a spiritual pilgrimage. It is a spiritual journal of spiritual journey toward a spiritual inheritance.
