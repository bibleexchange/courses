INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS

Remember, the Bible is first a spiritualBook. No matter what section of the Holy Scripture we study its highest concernwill always be a spiritual one.

The Bible is useful for business,reliable for history, and a fascinating read, but every precept laid out andrecorded account reveals a spiritual lesson:

\-1Genesis" creation is an elaborate revelation of salvation. Christ speaks life and light into our chaos and creates new life.

\-2The Hebrew Exodus parallels spiritual deliverance from the bonds of sin and this world.

\-3InNumbers, the Israelites" journey through the wilderness provokes thought concerning the spiritual themes of full reliance upon God and the life livedwalking in the Spirit. Numbers especially illustrates sanctification which aseparation from E

To the spiritual mind, a study of the O.T. law is quickening and provocative, but the carnal mind might find it lackluster.

ICorinthians2:14-16--But the natural man receiveth not the things of theSpirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he that is spiritual judgeth allthings, yet he himself is judged of no man. 16 For who hath known the mind ofthe Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.

The study of the offerings and priesthood is insightfully rich in teaching us how to approach a holy God andour service to Him. The blood of goats point to the Savior Jesus Christ and theinstruction of Moses is council from the ALMIGHTY GOD.

Do not study the Bible merely intellectually as a scholar, but devour the spirit of Its message heartily!

2 Corintians3:6-8--Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, wasglorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the faceof Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: 8How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?

The thirty-six chapters of Numbers journal the details of a spiritual pilgrimage. It is a spiritual journal of spiritual journey toward a spiritual inheritance.
