<p><span lang='en'>Remember&#44; the Bible is first a spiritualBook. No matter what section of the Holy Scripture we study its highest concernwill always be a spiritual one. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The Bible is useful for business&#44;reliable for history&#44; and a fascinating read&#44; but every precept laid out andrecorded account reveals a spiritual lesson: </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>-1Genesis&quot; creation is an elaborate revelation of salvation. Christ speaks life and light into our chaos and creates new life. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>-2The Hebrew Exodus parallels spiritual deliverance from the bonds of sin and this world. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>-3InNumbers&#44; the Israelites&quot; journey through the wilderness provokes thought concerning the spiritual themes of full reliance upon God and the life livedwalking in the Spirit. Numbers especially illustrates sanctification which aseparation from E </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>To the spiritual mind&#44; a study of the O.T. law is quickening and provocative&#44; but the carnal mind might find it lackluster. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>ICorinthians2:14-16--But the natural man receiveth not the things of theSpirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them&#44;because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he that is spiritual judgeth allthings&#44; yet he himself is judged of no man. 16 For who hath known the mind ofthe Lord&#44; that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The study of the offerings and priesthood is insightfully rich in teaching us how to approach a holy God andour service to Him. The blood of goats point to the Savior Jesus Christ and theinstruction of Moses is council from the ALMIGHTY GOD. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Do not study the Bible merely intellectually as a scholar&#44; but devour the spirit of Its message heartily! </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>2 Corintians3:6-8--Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter&#44; but of the spirit: for the letter killeth&#44; but the spirit giveth life.7 But if the ministration of death&#44; written and engraven in stones&#44; wasglorious&#44; so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the faceof Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: 8How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? </span></p>
