<h1><span lang='en'>Joseph (30:1-50:26)</span></h1>

<h2><span lang='en'>His Birth</span></h2>

<p><span lang='en'>Rachel was barren and very frustrated because of it. She even turned her frustration on her husband&#44; Jacob and blamed him for her barrenness. Out of their marital spat sprouted a plan in Rachel&apos;s mind--they would borrow from Abraham and Sarah&apos;s idea of substitutionary impregnation. This and further competitive efforts with Leah resulted in ten children for Jacob&#44; but failed to satisfy the heart of Rachel because the desire of her heart was to have a child of her own. Verse 22 says that God &quot;remembered&quot; Rachel and gave her a son. This does not infer that God forgot Rachel&#44; but emphasizes the point God recognized or was mindful of her at this ordained time. Rachel felt forgotten and worthless&#44; but God had a plan to bless her. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Rachel&apos;s self-worth was wrapped up in her ability to give Jacob at least one son and she felt like a reproach because of her barrenness. Her testimony of victory was that God had taken away her reproach in giving her a son&#44; Joseph. Only God can take away the reproach of sin. There is no ability in man to please God outside of the redemptive work ofChrist. No effort of the sinner can produce life&#44; but by the miracle of salvation is our &quot;barrenness&quot; and &quot;reproach&quot; removed! Not only did God heal her barrenness and remove her reproach&#44; but he restored her faith. She called her son Joseph meaning may God add or increase; added because she knew theLord would add to her another son. She was right because she eventually gave birth to Benjamin. Alas&#44; Rachel died from the difficulty of his birth.</span></p>

<h2><span lang='en'>His Character</span></h2>

<h3><span lang='en'>Excellence</span></h3>

<p><span lang='en'>Joseph was one of the most outstanding men of the Bible because of his personal character and despite intense difficulties overall excellence in life. Jacob&apos;s favoritism in giving him the coat of many colors and even the Lord&apos;s special attention to Joseph in giving him dreams of future exaltation provoked his brothers to envy. </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>COAT: It was a coat of long sleeves which was the garment of a boss and not a worker. It was a coat of many colorswhich greatly differed from everyday work clothes which necessitated noexpensive dyes or colorings. The coat undeniably made a distinction betweenJoseph and his brethren. (His father&apos;s special favor toward Joseph was becauseof Rachel.) </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>Dreamer</span></h3>

<p><span lang='en'>Joseph was a spiritual though youthful dreamer whose dreams came true even though he was initially rejected by his brethren. Hold onto the dreams God gives because they are a compass for life.</span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>DREAM 1: His brothers&quot; sheaves of wheat bowed down to Joseph&apos;s sheaf. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>DREAM 2: Sun&#44; Moon and Eleven Stars bowed down to Joseph. </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>Faithful</span></h3>

<p><span lang='en'>Joseph was enslaved&#44; falsely accused and forgotten by men&#44;but was faithful even in the hard places. Joseph enjoyed the presence of God and won the confidence of his master. Joseph had physical good looks&#44; but it was never a snare to him. Joseph resisted temptation and was silent amid foul accusations and unjust punishment. Joseph the interpreter of dreams proved that&quot;prison walls do not a prisoner make.&quot; Joseph is a perfect type of Christ and of the Overcomer. Joseph manifested great wisdom&#44; brotherly love&#44; filial devotion and utter submission to God. (Gen. 43:20; 45:8&#44;14&#44;23; 47:7.) He knew how to return good for evil and God preserved his family through his generosity. </span></p>
