<h1><span lang='en'>In the Beginning God (Before Man) 1:1-25 </span></h1>
<h2><span lang='en'>God is eternally existent. In the beginning God&hellip; </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>The Bible never attempts to prove the existence of God&#44; but merely acceptsHis eternal existence as a foregone conclusion. God is eternally existent and preceded all matter and persons. (Deut. 32:40; 33:27; Job 36:26; Psalm 9:7;Isa. 57:15; Rev. 1:8) </span></p>
<blockquote><span lang='en'>Hebrews 11:6--&hellip;he that cometh to God must believe that he is&#44; and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang='en'>The foundation of Christianity is faith. In the fullness of time&#44; this faith can be confirmed by observable facts. Although filled with scientifically accurate material&#44; the intent of Scripture is not to give a world history or ascientific exegesis of all things natural. Only the first two chapters aredevoted to a synopsis of creation and it promptly proceeds to the maincourse--God&apos;s dealings with man and specifically&#44; the Hebrew people. All thebooks of the Old Testament concern themselves with this thought. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>As both Creationism and Evolution require faith&#44; It would seem the only necessity for the idea of evolution is to create a situation where man can be independent of God and free to establish his own rules of life. Evolution is the religion of the atheist. To believe in the religion of evolution is to beanti-God in that it is in stark contrast to the record of Scripture&#44; God&apos;s HolyWord. </span></p>
<h2><span lang='en'>God is the Creator of all things </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>God--&quot;Elohim&quot; supreme God; superlative; creative glory (found in 180 verses in Genesis; 2&#44;249 verses in the O.T.) Gen. 6:7;Isa. 43:15; John 1:3; Heb. 1:10; I Peter 4:19 </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>All things have their beginning and source in God.</span></h3>

<p><span lang='en'>Even Lucifer was created by God and had his beginning in God. As a beautiful angelic being on whom God bestowed great privilege&#44; Lucifer rebelled against the order of Godand fell into the condemnation of the devil. (Isaiah 14:12; I Timothy 3:6; Gen.3:1)</span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>In any sense&#44; God did not author evil&#44; but in His desire to have a creation that out of its own free-will chose to serve Him&#44; He provided the freedom of choice. </span></h3>

<p><span lang='en'>Good &amp;evil are not created items&#44; but descriptions of the choices of the will.In absolutely no way can we attribute evil to God. </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>Before God there was nothing and without God there is nothing. (Gen. 1:1; John 1:1-3) </span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'>Only God can create something out of nothing.</span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>Genesis&apos; Record of Creation is God&apos;s Record </span></h3>
<h4><span lang='en'>Do Chapter&apos;s 1 &amp; 2 contradict each Other? </span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>The sequential differences of the creative events recorded in chapters one and two have been the topic of much criticism. In chapter one&#44; the purpose of the writer is to give a brief summary of the highlights of creation. In chapter two&#44; the writer is establishing theplace of man in this creation while reiterating material already covered in chapter one. There is no contradiction found here. It is because the author&apos;s purpose changes when chapter two begins&#44; that we see any differences.Again&#44; these differences are still never contradictory&#44; but only the details that achieve the specific goal of the Author are reiterated while unnecessary details are left out. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Always keep in mind the ultimate intent of the Old Testament Scriptures. Their intent is not to investigate every scientific detail of the natural world or even to give a complete history of humanity&#44; but is to follow God&apos;s dealings with the nation of Israel. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Not every conversation that ever took place is recorded&#44; not every event is remembered&#44; and not even every singular thought of God could possibly have been preserved in the 66 books of the Bible. Details are intentionally left out when they are diversions from theAuthor&apos;s motive and purpose. Only the details that God has determined in His infinite wisdom necessary to the revelation of God&apos;s will for man are recorded.uWhen seeking to understand difficult passages&#44; subject Scripture to the light of its intentions&#44; </span></p>

<h4><span lang='en'>Authenticity of Scripture </span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>Scripture bases its authenticity and authority on the fact of Divine inspiration. The Divine inspiration of Scripture is evidenced by the combination of these proofs: </span></p>
<h5><span lang='en'>The Preservation of Scripture </span></h5>
<p><span lang='en'>No book has been as fervently fought through the ages and yet it has triumphantly endured. </span></p>
<h5><span lang='en'>The Accuracy of Scripture </span></h5>
<p><span lang='en'>The claims it makes for itself&#44; God and the function of the natural world and humanity can be tested and observed as true. </span></p>
<h5><span lang='en'>The Prophecy of Scripture </span></h5>
<p><span lang='en'>The accuracy of its prophetic statements has been found far superior to any other work of prophecy. The Bible is more up to date than this morning&apos;s newspaper. </span></p>
<h5><span lang='en'>The Relevance of Scripture </span></h5>
<p><span lang='en'>Simply put&#44; it works! Its principles can be practically applied and found true. </span></p>
<h4><span lang='en'>Authenticity of Evolution </span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>Evolution claims to base its authenticity on the advancements of scientific thought--that is&#44; the laws of observable facts.This scientific thought is constantly changing as understanding of our world changes. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Evolution is not a science&#44; however&#44; but is more of a religion that requires faith. As a theory&#44; it postulates for millions of transitional species that have never been seen. It does not even attempt to answer the question of origin&#44; but makesastronomically sized assumptions and moves from there. The only variations of species to be scientifically observed have been a)harmful and detrimental b)only differences within the species and not the development of new species altogether. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>NOTE: Vast amounts of information on this debate can be found all over the internet and in multitudes of published works.<a href='#footnotes'>[2]</a></span></p>
<h2><span lang='en'>The Nature of God </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>Although God&apos;s existence is a foregone conclusion&#44; the nature of God is extensively detailed in Scripture. All that Christians know and doctrinally claim concerning God is revealed in the pages of the Bible. In the Hebrew Old Testament&#44; there are manynames<a href='#footnotes'>[3]</a>or titles referring to God&#44; and each is uniquely descriptive. Much of the nature of God can be understood by a look at these names. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Jehovah (YVWH) -- the Covenant Name of God--is the most popular and widely used. It is used in conjunction with different words establishing the correlation of God&apos;s promises and God&apos;s name. (Heb. 6:13; 15:3; Ps 83:18; Mark 13:31; Ps. 138:2)The use of Jehovah is signaled in the KJV by the use of all capital letters: LORD. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Elohim is perhaps the most comprehensive name of God. It expresses the Trinity and the fullness of the Godhead. It also expresses the creative power and glory of God. </span></p>
