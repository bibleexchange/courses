## The Name

The priestly ministry in the wilderness and the holy worship of Jehovah.

Levi was the third son of Jacob (Gen.29:34) and more importantly the tribe which produced Aaron (Ex.4:14) the first High Priest after the Levitical Priesthood. The priesthood and sacrifices, although, did not begin with Aaron(Heb. 7:11). When the Israelites left Egypt, the ancient manner of worship was still observed by them, the eldest son of each house inheriting the priest's office,but this change was made at Mount Sinai conferring upon Aaron and his sons this office.<sup>[1]</sup>

And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office….—Ex. 28:1

The Hebrews refer to this book as"The Priest's Law "<sup>[2]</sup>.The book of Hebrews is the source for the Vulgate title of this book and is its best commentary1:

If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,)what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order ofMelchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?—Heb. 7:11; Ps. 110:4

NOTE: Paul is establishing the paramount conclusion that as important as the Law and specifically the priesthood of the Old Testament was, it was not established byGod as the end of His Divine purpose, but a building block and lesson preparingthe way for a more perfect system of communing with God. Heb. 9:11; 10:1
