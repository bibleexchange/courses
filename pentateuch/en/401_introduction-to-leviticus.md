# Leviticus

## Introduction to Leviticus

### Purpose and Theme of Leviticus

Leviticus theme of "holiness" and "access to God" answers the great question, "How can unholy men access a holy God?" The word holy occurs over 80 times in this book. The New Testament book of Hebrews is a close companion in theme to Leviticus.

### Key Verse

> Leviticus 20:7-8—Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God. And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.

### Main People

The people who bring the offerings (people of God) and the people who sacrifice the offerings (priests).

### Key Thoughts

**Holiness**: …ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. (11:45)

**Access to God**: …I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me… (10:3)

### Brief Outline

1. Sacrifice and Separation: How can unholy men access a holy God? (Ch. 1-7)
2. The Priest: Priests went to God with the prayers andpraises of the people. (Ch. 8-10)
3. Rules of Cleanliness/Holiness: God cares about every detail of our lives. (Ch. 11-22)
4. The Feasts (Ch. 16 and 23)
5. Final Instructions (Ch. 24-27)

### The Name

The priestly ministry in the wilderness and the holy worship of Jehovah.

Levi was the third son of Jacob (Gen. 29:34) and more importantly the tribe which produced Aaron (Ex.4:14) the first High Priest after the Levitical Priesthood. The priesthood and sacrifices, although, did not begin with Aaron(Heb. 7:11). When the Israelites left Egypt, the ancient manner of worship was still observed by them, the eldest son of each house inheriting the priest's office,but this change was made at Mount Sinai conferring upon Aaron and his sons this office.<sup>[1]</sup>

> Ex. 28:1--And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office…

The Hebrews refer to this book as "The Priest's Law."<sup>[2]</sup> The book of Hebrews is the source for the Vulgate title of this book and is its best commentary:

If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? (Heb. 7:11; Ps. 110:4)

NOTE: Paul is establishing the paramount conclusion that as important as the Law and specifically the priesthood of the Old Testament was, it was not established byGod as the end of His Divine purpose, but a building block and lesson preparingthe way for a more perfect system of communing with God (Heb. 9:11; 10:1).

### The Setting

This book is generally held to be the work of Moses, though he was probably assisted by Aaron. Its date is B.C. 1490. It contains the history of the first month of their second year after leaving Egypt.

1. Moses and the People Finished the Tabernacle (Ex. 40:33)
2. The Glory of the Lord Filled the Tabernacle (Ex. 40:34-38)
3. The Lord Spoke to Moses out of the Tabernacle (Lev. 1:1)
