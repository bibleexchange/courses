<h2><span lang='en'>The Name </span></h2>
	<p><span lang='en'>The priestly ministry in the wilderness and the holy worship of Jehovah. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Levi was the third son of Jacob (Gen.29:34) and more importantly the tribe which produced Aaron (Ex.4:14) the first High Priest after the Levitical Priesthood. The priesthood and sacrifices&#44; although&#44; did not begin with Aaron(Heb. 7:11). When the Israelites left Egypt&#44; the ancient manner of worship was still observed by them&#44; the eldest son of each house inheriting the priest's office&#44;but this change was made at Mount Sinai conferring upon Aaron and his sons this office.<a href='#footnotes'>[1]</a></span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother&#44; and his sons with him&#44; from among the children of Israel&#44; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office&hellip;.&mdash;Ex. 28:1 </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>The Hebrews refer to this book as&quot;The Priest&apos;s Law &quot; <a href='#footnotes'>[2]</a>.The book of Hebrews is the source for the Vulgate title of this book and is its best commentary1: </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood&#44; (for under it the people received the law&#44;)what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order ofMelchisedec&#44; and not be called after the order of Aaron?&mdash;Heb. 7:11; Ps. 110:4 </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>NOTE: Paul is establishing the paramount conclusion that as important as the Law and specifically the priesthood of the Old Testament was&#44; it was not established byGod as the end of His Divine purpose&#44; but a building block and lesson preparingthe way for a more perfect system of communing with God. Heb. 9:11; 10:1 </span></p>
