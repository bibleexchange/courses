## Highlights from Deuteronomy

### Deuteronomy is a Book of Remembering

> Only take heed to thyself,and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the daysof thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;

The old generation that had left Egypt died by the way, except for Joshua and Caleb (1:36; Num. 32:12), and a new generation must have the old-time laws rehearsed in their hearing.<sup>[1]</span>

The remembrance of deliverance from Egypt is constantly urged as a motive to obedience (5:15; 10:12-13).

Deuteronomy is a most integral part of the Pentateuch seeing that it condenses and continues the great truths of the first four books of the Bible, namely:

1. Divine election of Israel, prominent in Genesis.
2. Divine deliverance of Israel, conspicuous in Exodus.
3. Divine holiness of Israel, pre-eminent in Leviticus.
4. Divine jealousy and determination, in Numbers. (8:2 wilderness purpose)
5. Divine love and bounty in Deuteronomy. (7:6-16)

Remember the Law of the Land. 4:5

Remember Especially Deut. 4:10; Ex 19:9,16; 20:18; Heb 12:18-19

### Possess the Land

But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.

THERE IS A BATTLE TO BE FOUGHT!

If thou shalt say in thine heart,These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?

> Deuteronomy 7:17-18-Thou shalt not be afraid of them:but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof,and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. And the rest ofGilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe ofManasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called theland of giants.
