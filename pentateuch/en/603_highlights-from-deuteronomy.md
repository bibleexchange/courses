# Highlights from Deuteronomy

## Deuteronomy is a Book of Remembering

> Only take heed to thyself,and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the daysof thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;

The old generation that had left Egypt died by the way, except for Joshua and Caleb (1:36; Num. 32:12), and a new generation must have the old-time laws rehearsed in their hearing.<sup>[1]</span>

The remembrance of deliverance from Egypt is constantly urged as a motive to obedience. (5:15; 10:12,13)sup1

Divine jealousy and determination,in Numbers. (8:2 wilderness purpose)

Divine love and bounty inDeuteronomy. (7:6-16)
