## Noah (5:29-10:7)

### The name Noah means rest

Following Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden, sin spread like an epidemic. In his jealousy, Cain murdered his own brother. God judges Cain making him a fugitive, but would not hold others guiltless in taking Cain's life (God set a mark upon Cain). The influence of sin was everywhere and growing every day. We see the degeneration of man (…every imagination of the thoughts of his \[humanity\] heart was only evil continually. 6:5) epitomized in "Lamech I" (4:18-24), a sixth generation descendant of Cain. He not only had two wives, but he murdered two men. It was upon this scene of sin's broad influence in the earth into which Noah was born to "Lamech II" (an eighth generation descendent of Seth).

> Genesis 5:29–And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.

Noah was a sign to his generation of a ‘rest’ from the futile toil of sin and of the salvation of God (Ps. 37:7; Jer. 6:16; Heb. 4:9).

### Noah's Family

He was the tenth in descent fromAdam, in the line of Seth, the son of Lamech and grandson of Methuselah. We hear nothing of Noah until he is 500 years old when he begat three sons, Shem,Ham and Japheth.

### Noah's Life

#### Who Was Noah?

Through faith he built an ark to the saving of his household (I Pt. 3:20; Heb. 11:7). During the period of building the ark it is said that he was a righteous man and perfect in his generations (i.e. among his contemporaries), and that he, like Enoch, walked with God (Gen. 6:9; 2 Peter 2:5). He was 600 years old at the Flood and lived 950 years. He lived approximately 2948 BC to 1998 BC.

#### Person Number 8 out of 8 People on the Ark Or The 8th Preacher of Righteousness?

> II Peter 2:5–And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;

> I Peter 3:20–… few, that is, eight souls were saved by water (Genesis 7:1-24)

Adam Clarke's Commentary:

> [Saved Noah the eighth] Some think that the words should be translated, Noah the eighth preacher of righteousness; but it seems most evident, from 1Pe 3:20, that eight persons are here meant, which were the whole that were saved in the ark, viz. Shem, Ham, Japheth, and their three wives,six; Noah's wife seven; and Noah himself the eighth. The form of expression, ogdoonmwe, "Noah the eighth", that is, "Noah and seven more", is most common in the Greek language.<sup>[1]</sup>

### Differences Before and After the Flood

Was the world different after the flood from how it was before the flood?

#### CANOPY

One possible difference in the world before the flood was water above the earth. During the second creative day the Bible says God separated the waters above the earth from the waters below the earth.Then God said to let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters, and God called the expanse Heaven.

This has been interpreted various ways. Some have seen this as referring to a water vapor canopy that enveloped the earth. Such a canopy would have produced a greenhouse effect keeping the climate at a moderate temperature worldwide. This would allow for rich vegetation as well as long life for the inhabitants of the earth.

#### RAIN CLOUDS

A second school of thought concerning the firmament is that it may have consisted of ordinary rain clouds. This line of thought argues against the idea of a canopy, by quoting Psalm148:4-6. According to this passage, the waters above were still in existence when the Psalmist wrote. Furthermore, the psalm states that they would remain forever by the unalterable decree of God.

#### NO RAIN

The Bible possibly teaches that there was no rain before the Flood (Gen. 2:5). But there went up a mist from the earth,and watered the whole face of the ground (2:6). There is no reference ofrain having fallen until the time of the deluge. The argument is essentiallyfrom the silence of the Bible, for there is no definitive statement in eithercase, for we merely assume that from the time of the creation no changetakes place until the Flood.

#### UNIFORM CLIMATE

The climate before the Flood may have been more uniform than today, that is, not having the same extremes intemperature. The Bible seems to indicate that the seasons wereestablished after the flood (Gen. 8:22).

#### VEGETARIANS

Scripture possibly teaches that humankind and the animals were not meat eaters until after the Flood. This conclusion may be drawn from Genesis 1:29.

#### LONGEVITY

Before the Flood, the people lived much longer. This longevity created a scenario where Adam could have rehearsed thestory of the "beginning" directly to the ears of hisgreat-great-great-great-great-great grandson, Lamech (Noah's father). The longlives of these Patriarchs definitely increase the probability of an accuraterecord of the beginning being preserved through the ages. Observation two: Adamlived long enough to witness the results of his fall in the Garden unto eightgenerations. Observation three: The longevity of life before the flood may be attributed to possible factors: 1)The degeneration of all things that was the result of sin was not as developed until after the Flood and 2)the world beforethe flood was a much healthier environment and with a more uniform climatepossibly enhanced by the greenhouse effect of a protective canopy.

2. A new month commenced with the new moon Numbers 10:10; Psalms 81:3
3. Each new moon was commemorated with feast and sacrifice. Num.10:10; 28:11; I Sam. 20:5; Ps. 81:3; Isa. 1:14; Hosea 2:11
4. The Civil Day was from sun-set one evening to sun-set the next;for "the evening and the morning were the first day."
5. NIGHT Watches (Ancient): First till midnight, Middle till 3 a.m.,Morning till 6 a.m.
6. NIGHT Watches (New Testament) First-Evening-6 to 9 pm Second-Midnight-9to 12 a.m. Third-12 to 3 a.m. Fourth-morning-3 to 6 a.m.

9. In the history of the Jews, the year was wholly lunar, having alternately a full month of thirty days, and a defective month of twenty-nine days, thus completing their year in three hundred and fifty-four days. As the lunar year, which the Jews followed, is shorter than the solar year by eleven days, the Jewish calendar contains a 13th month.
