<h1><span lang='en'>Noah 5:29-10:7 </span></h1>
<h2><span lang='en'>The name Noah means rest.</span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>Following Adam and Eve&apos;s expulsion from Eden&#44; sin spread like an epidemic. In his jealousy&#44; Cain murdered his own brother. God judges Cain making him a fugitive&#44; but would not hold others guiltless in taking Cain&apos;s life (God set a mark upon Cain). The influence of sin was everywhere and growing every day. We see the degeneration of man (&hellip;every imagination of the thoughts of his [humanity] heart was only evil continually. 6:5) epitomized in &quot;Lamech I&quot; (4:18-24)&#44; a sixth generation descendant of Cain. He not only had two wives&#44; but he murdered two men. It was upon this scene of sin&apos;s broad influence in the earth into which Noah was born to &quot;Lamech II&quot; (an eighth generation descendent of Seth). </span></p>
<blockquote><span lang='en'>Genesis 5:29--And he called his name Noah&#44; saying&#44; uThis same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands&#44; because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang='en'>Noah was a sign to his generation of a &lsquo;rest&rsquo; from the futile toil of sin and of the salvation of God. (Ps. 37:7; Jer. 6:16; Heb. 4:9;) </span></p>
<h2><span lang='en'>Noah&apos;s Family </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>He was the tenth in descent fromAdam&#44; in the line of Seth&#44; the son of Lamech and grandson of Methuselah. We hear nothing of Noah until he is 500 years old when he begat three sons&#44; Shem&#44;Ham and Japheth. </span></p>
<h2><span lang='en'>Noah&apos;s Life </span></h2>
<h3><span lang='en'>Who Was Noah? </span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'>Through faith he built an ark to the saving of his household. (I Pt. 3:20; Heb.11:7) During the period of building the ark it is said that he was a righteous man and perfect in his generations (i.e. among his contemporaries)&#44; and that he&#44; like Enoch&#44; walked with God. (Gen. 6:9; 2 Peter 2:5) He was 600 years old at the Flood and lived 950 years. He lived approximately 2948 BC to 1998 BC. </span></p><table><tr>

<h3><span lang='en'>Differences Before and After the Flood</span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'>Was the world different after the flood from how it was before the flood? </span></p>

<h4><span lang='en'>CANOPY</span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>One possible difference in the world before the flood was water above the earth. During the second creative day the Bible says God separated the waters above the earth from the waters below the earth.Then God said to let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters&#44; and God called the expanse Heaven. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>This has been interpreted various ways. Some have seen this as referring to a water vapor canopy that enveloped the earth. Such a canopy would have produced a greenhouse effect keeping the climate at a moderate temperature worldwide. This would allow for rich vegetation as well as long life for the inhabitants of the earth. </span></p>

<h4><span lang='en'>RAIN CLOUDS</span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>A second school of thought concerning the firmament is that it may have consisted of ordinary rain clouds. This line of thought argues against the idea of a canopy&#44; by quoting Psalm148:4-6. According to this passage&#44; the waters above were still in existence when the Psalmist wrote. Furthermore&#44; the psalm states that they would remain forever by the unalterable decree of God. </span></p>

<h4><span lang='en'>NO RAIN</span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>The Bible possibly teaches that there was no rain before the Flood (Gen. 2:5). But there went up a mist from the earth&#44;and watered the whole face of the ground.--2:6. There is no reference ofrain having fallen until the time of the deluge. The argument is essentiallyfrom the silence of the Bible&#44; for there is no definitive statement in eithercase&#44; for we merely assume that from the time of the creation no changetakes place until the Flood. </span></p>

<h4><span lang='en'>UNIFORM CLIMATE</span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>The climate before the Flood may have been more uniform than today&#44; that is&#44; not having the same extremes intemperature. The Bible seems to indicate that the seasons wereestablished after the flood.--Gen. 8:22. </span></p>

<h4><span lang='en'>VEGETARIANS</span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>Scripture possibly teaches that humankind and the animals were not meat eaters until after the Flood. This conclusion may be drawn from Genesis 1:29. </span></p>

<h4><span lang='en'>LONGEVITY</span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>Before the Flood&#44; the people lived much longer. This longevity created a scenario where Adam could have rehearsed thestory of the &quot;beginning&quot; directly to the ears of hisgreat-great-great-great-great-great grandson&#44; Lamech (Noah&apos;s father). The longlives of these Patriarchs definitely increase the probability of an accuraterecord of the beginning being preserved through the ages. Observation two: Adamlived long enough to witness the results of his fall in the Garden unto eightgenerations. Observation three: The longevity of life before the flood may be attributed to possible factors: 1)The degeneration of all things that was the result of sin was not as developed until after the Flood and 2)the world beforethe flood was a much healthier environment and with a more uniform climatepossibly enhanced by the greenhouse effect of a protective canopy. </span></p>
