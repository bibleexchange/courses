# Isaac (25:19-35:29)

Isaac was the son of Abraham and Sarah whose name means laughter. (17:17; 18:12; 21:6.) He was born at Gerar when Abraham was 100 years of age and Sarah was about 90 years old. (17:17-21;21:3-12)

Isaac's is one of the few cases which God selected a name for a child and announced it before he was born. In the Old Testament we have: Isaac, Ishmael, Solomon, Josiah, Cyrus, and Isaiah's son; in the New Testament we have: John the Baptist and Jesus.

Isaac is the child of the covenant and was circumcised at eight days old. According to Josephus, Isaac was 25 years old at his offering on Mount Moriah in Genesis 22:12. Isaac is also typical of Christ who gave Himself for our sins. Isaac's mother, Sarah, died when he was 36 years old. After his mother's death, Isaac married Rebekah. Isaac is the only Patriarch that had only one wife. This account in Genesis 24 is typical to us of the Bride of Christ. Isaac had two sons: Jacob and Esau. Isaac lived 180 years.
