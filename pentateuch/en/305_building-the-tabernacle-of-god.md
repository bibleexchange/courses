## Building the Tabernacle of God (CH. 25-40)

The Tabernacle with its priesthood,furniture and functions will be explored in detail in other studies, but for now we will only see a bird's eye view at this spiritually rich subject.

### Purpose & Pattern of the Tabernacle (CH. 25-27, 30-31, 36-39)

Moses vowed in his song in Exodus 15: "I will prepare you a habitation." God's instruction on Mount Sinai concerning the tabernacle had not been given yet, but Moses appears to have received some insight beforehand. The tabernacle of God is first in the hearts of His people. The purpose of the tabernacle was to give God an earthly vesselin which to dwell. The tabernacle itself is a type of Christ and a pattern of the life of the Believer.

Materials for the Tabernacle came from the Free-will Offerings of the people.

> Exodus 25:2-Speak unto the children of Israel,that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.

God himself designed the tabernacle and set its pattern

> Exodus 25:9-According to all that I shew thee,after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.
