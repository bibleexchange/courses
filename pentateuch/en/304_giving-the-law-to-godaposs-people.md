> Revelation 22:14—Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

#### Keeping the Law Does Not Justify

> Acts 13:39—And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
