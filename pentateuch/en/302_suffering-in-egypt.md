<h2><span lang='en'>The Slavery of the Israelites (CH. 1) </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>Israel was a small nomadic people(&quot;70 souls&quot; 1:5) going into Egypt&#44; but were fruitful and multiplied so that the land was filled with them (1:7). At the Exodus&#44; there were approximately two million Jews. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Pharaoh gifted the fertile lands and river delta of the mighty Nile River known as Goshen to Joseph&apos;s family. This land started as a land of liberty and abundance&#44; but eventually was transformed into a land of bondage. Joseph&#44; his brethren&#44; and all their generation died and a new king rose to power that &quot;knew not Joseph.&quot; [The Hyksos (&quot;foreignrulers&quot; from the Northeast) may have invaded Egypt shortly after Joseph&apos;s death. This fact might be part of why the Hebrews fell out of favor with the Egyptians so quickly. ] This Pharaoh feared the great numbers of Israel and instituted a plan of affliction. The Egyptians discovered that the harder they afflicted the Hebrews&#44; the more they prospered! During the most intense periodsof persecution&#44; the Church of God has grown. The winds of persecution only fanthe fires of revival! Let us compare some of the phrases describing Israel and the efforts of Pharaoh: </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>Pharaoh&quot; strategy to kill the malechildren failed utterly because the midwives chose to fear God over man. Godprotected and blessed the midwives&#44; Shiprah and Puah&#44; for their courage. &quot;Godmade them houses&#44;&quot; that is&#44; He protected them and allowed them to have manychildren themselves. Pharaoh responded to this rebellion by opening the chargeof murder to every Egyptian. It is upon this bloody and dangerous scene thatMoses made his entrance as an innocent Levite baby. This decree was probably given sometime after Aaron&apos;s birth and retracted very shortly after Moses&apos;birth. (Perhaps&#44; baby Moses&apos; influence on Pharaoh&apos;s daughter had something todo with its end.) </span></p>

<h2><span lang='en'>The Call of Moses to be Leader and Deliverer (CH. 2-4) </span></h2>

<h3><span lang='en'>2:1-4 Moses&apos; Parent&apos;s Plan: Trust God </span></h3>

<p><span lang='en'>Both being Levites&#44; Amram and Jochebed married. They had two children before Moses&#44; Aaron and Miriam. The Scripture says that Miriam took notice thatMoses was a &quot;goodly&quot; child. A mother has ever seen an ugly baby&#44; but maybe the looming edict of death caused Jochebed to appreciate her healthy baby boy a little more. Every new life is so precious and a gift from God. Pharoah&apos;s edict was horrendous and can only be compared to the hundreds of millions of abortions that that have been committed in the past 40 years. One look at that sweet&#44; happy baby and Jochebed was determined no one&#44; not even Pharaoh&#44; was going to kill her baby. For three months she hid him. She had to muffle everycry and perhaps cover him with blankets every time she heard voices or footsteps outside. Jochebed took every precaution and was a diligent guardian of her precious cargo&#44; but she realized&#44; as her baby grew&#44; it was only a matter of time before he would be discovered. </span></p>
<blockquote><span lang='en'>Exodus 2:3&mdash;And when she could not longer hide him&#44; she took for him an ark of bulrushes&#44; and daubed it with slime and with pitch&#44; and put the child therein; and she laid itin the flags by the river's brink. </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang='en'>The ark was a small boat or basket made of the Egyptian reed called papyrus. This was a somewhat common application in Egypt because more sturdy resources were not plenteous. </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>2:5-10 Discovered&#44; Named and Raised by Pharaoh&apos;s Daughter.</span></h3>

<p><span lang='en'>Miriam patiently guarded her brother placed gently among the protective &quot;flags&quot; or reeds (probably papyrus). By instinctive motherly precautions and Divine appointment&#44; the ark was placed in plain sight to Pharaoh&apos;s daughter as she bathed in the Nile. This was a bold move&#44; but because God was leading the way&#44; Moses was as safe as he possibly could be! The baby touched the heart of Pharaoh&apos;s daughter and because she drew him out of the water&#44; she named him Moses. Pharaoh&apos;s daughter (HistorianJosephus suggests her name was Thermuthis) commissioned Moses&apos; own mother to nurse and care for him until he was weaned.</span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>2:11-15 Moses Murders and Flees. </span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'>Moses was dissatisfied and incomplete abiding in Pharaoh&apos;s place. He makes an amazing to choice to be with his Hebrew people instead of with the Egyptians. One day Moses took an inspective look at the condition of the Hebrews and was greatly angered as he witnessed the unjust treatment his people endure. </span></p>

<blockquote><span lang='en'>Exodus 2:11&#44;12&mdash;&hellip;he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew&#44; one of his brethren. 12 &hellip;he slew the Egyptian&#44; and hid him in the sand. </span></blockquote>

<p><span lang='en'>Moses heart was to deliver his people from their bondage&#44; but this was NOT God&apos;s method. God had a plan that involved the Egyptians sending off the Hebrews and giving them riches as apartial restitution. (3:21) Moses had to flee for his life to Midian because there were witnesses to his murder and Pharaoh sought for his life. </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>2:16-22 Moses Rescues the Daughters of Reul and Dwells in Midian.</span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'> Midian is a land of Arabia east of the Red Sea near Mount Sinai. When Moses reached Midian&#44; he witnessed thebullying of the seven daughters of the priest Reul. Moses plays the part of a hero and defends them against the brutish shepherds. As a reward for his heroics&#44; he was invited for supper and eventually given Zipporah to marry.Zipporah gave birth to Gershom whose name means a stranger here orrefugee. Moses also had a second son named Eliezar (18:4)&#44; but mysteriouslythere is no mention of him in this particular passage. The addition would be necessary here because Exodus 4:20 says that Moses took his wife and sons with him when he eventually returned to Egypt.Moses took up the vocation of shephered during his forty years in Midian. </span></p>
<blockquote><span lang='en'>Exodus 3:1&mdash;Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law&#44; the priest of Midian: </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang='en'>When comparing Exodus 2:18 and 3:1&#44;there is some explanation necessary to justify the use of the two names &quot;Reul&quot;and &quot;Jethro&quot; for both of these names are seemingly given as names for Moses&quot;father-in-law. The identical Hebrew word we translate father-in-law in Exodus3:1 is translated son-in-law in Genesis 19:14. Many learned scholars of Hebrew are puzzled by this word&#44; but it seems to be a general term for a relative by marriage&#44; and the context of its use can only identify its precisemeaning. With this in mind&#44; some have speculated that Reul was the name ofMoses&quot; father-in-law and Jethro or Hobab was Reul&apos;s son&#44; and Moses&quot;brother-in-law. It is still possible that Reul&#44; Jethro&#44; Raguel&#44; Hobab&#44; Keyniare all names of one man&#44; Moses&quot; father-in-law. A third possibility is Ruel was the grandfather of Zipporah and Jethro was the immediate father of the seven sisters and Moses&quot; father-in-law. (Ex 2:18; 3:1; 4:18; 18:1; Nu 10:29; Judges1:16; 4:11) </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>2:23-4:28 God Sets His Great Plan of Deliverance in Motion. </span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'>About Forty years after Moses fled fromEgypt&#44; the king of Egypt died. Pharaoh&apos;s death made Moses&quot; return to Egypt possible since he had made search for Moses for murdering the Egyptian. Also&#44;at this time the cry for deliverance among the Hebrew slaves was coming to a.climax. God heard their groaning and in remembrance of his covenant withAbraham&#44; Isaac and Jacob and had respect unto them&#44; that is&#44; God regardedtheir plight and did not ignore their cry. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>In response to Israel&apos;s cry&#44; God set in motion his miraculous plan of deliverance by making a most unusual visit to Moses. Moses&#44; who kept the flock of Jethro&#44; led the flock to the backside ofthe desert to the mountain of God (this mountain had two peaks named Horeb and Sinai. Sinai is the most popular name since it means bush and makes reference to the miraculous visitation of God.) As he made his climb up the mount&#44; Moses was startled by the sight of a bush on fire that was not consumed by the flame. The fact the bush did not burn up was a great curiosity to Moses and he turned aside to inspect it. The fire was not God&#44; but God spoke out of the midst of the fire. God is spoken of as a fire in many other verses of Scripture&#44; but only as a figure of speech. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>1)The Fire that Did not Consume theBush spoke of God&apos;s mercy. Just as the bush was not consumed&#44; Moses was able to speak with and look upon themanifestation of God without dying. The saints of God are not destroyed by thefire of God&#44; but are purified by it! Compare Psalm 68:2 and Luke 3:16. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>2)A Consuming Fire speaks of the intensity and heat of God&apos;s jealousy for His people. (Deut. 4:24;9:3; Eze. 36:5; 2 Thess. 1:8; Rev. 20:9) </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Moses had several questions and although they were evidences of his own weaknesses&#44; now was definitely the time to deal with them! If Moses waited until he stood before Pharaoh to count thecost and the ramifications of his quest&#44; he might have backed down to the kingand made a hasty retreat. There is never a benefit in being anything less than100% open to God because there is no escaping His judgment. We can either faceHis anger now while it is mixed with mercy or later when eternal judgment isset. It does not get any easier by trying to avoid correction. Moses istransparent before God with his questions and after some rebuke and instructionfrom the Lord&#44; he is all the better for it: </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>1. Who amI? 3:11&#44;12 God not only ordained Moses to speak&#44; but gave him the very words to say. Moses was sent under the authority of Almighty God and not undersome birth right of his own. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>2. What is Your name? 3:13-22 IAM (Compare with John 18:6.) </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>3. What if they do not believe me? 4:1-9 Two signs (The Rod &amp; Leprosy) were given to Moses. They spoke of the call&#44; will and authority ofGod. The minister of God goes in the name of God and thesesignsshall follow them that believe. (Mark 16:17) </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>4. Cansomeone else do this because I am not able to speak? 4:10-17 God responds with a very strong rebuke of Moses. </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>4:18-26&#44;Moses learned a serious lesson: God requires implicit (exact) obedience. </span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'>God will keep His Word and expects us to keep our end of the bargain. Moses&apos; slackness almost cost him his life and he was only rescued by the action of Zipporah. </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>4:27-31 Moses is Reunited with Aaron &amp; Received by Israel.</span></h3>
<p><span lang='en'>The people saw the signs and believed and worshipped God for His recognition of their bondage. </span></p>

<h3><span lang='en'>The Preparation of Moses</span></h3>

<h4><span lang='en'>Moses was divinely positioned in a place where he could be molded into what God wanted him to be.</span></h4>
<p><span lang='en'>Though assisted by Jochabed, Moses only ended up in the arms of Pharaoh&apos;s daughter by the will of God.
</span></p>
<h5><span lang='en'>Moses was taught in Egypt</span></h5>
<blockquote><span lang='en'>Acts 7:22&mdash;And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians&#44; and was mighty in words and in deeds. </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang='en'>The education the Egyptian&apos;s gave Moses prepared him for his mission from God. Unless we have a fluent understanding of natural things (especially reading and writing) then we are greatly disadvantaged from having a complete understanding of the things of God. Moses was 40 years in Egypt.</span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>In Pharaoh&apos;s house&#44; Moses benefited from the knowledge and luxuries of Egypt. After all the thorough training Egypt had to offer&#44; Moses still had much to learn about following God and leading God&apos;s people.</span></p>

<h5><span lang='en'>Moses was trained in Midian</span></h5>
<p><span lang='en'>Jethro was a descendent of Abraham (though not through Isaac) and explained a little ( or perhaps much) about the one true God that his ancestors served. In Midian, Moses was trained in the ways of God. God wants us to study His Word and His Ways.</span></h4>
<blockquote><span lang='en'>
2 Timothy 2:15&mdash;Study to show thyself approved unto God , a workman the needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang='en'>
Moses was 40 years in the wilderness. That makes 80 years of training altogether.</span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>Moses was tested on the small tasks until it was time for him to take the role of deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>Many of the lessons Moses learned came by simple life tasks. By learning to lead sheep, Moses was learning to lead the Israelites. God wants us to learn diligence and faithfulness. The wilderness is a place of testing and trial. No one ever said God's will would be easy, and things that are easy usually are not worth anything.</span></p>

<h2><span lang='en'>The Challenge of Pharaoh&apos;s Power (CH. 5-11) </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>Nine times in this account we read the phrase &quot;let My people go.&quot; It was God&apos;s will that the Hebrews be free and He worked it out exactly as He had promised (3:21). It was God&apos;s will that the Egyptians would send out the Hebrews and that Israel would not gain their independence merely by a military revolt. This sending out would eventually include the Egyptians giving much wealth and gifts to theHebrews as they left. </span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>For this impossibility to take place much had to change in the hearts and minds of the Egyptians. God preparedPharaoh and the Egyptians for the great sending away of the Hebrews by establishingHe alone was God and there was no false god in Egypt that could stand againstJehovah. With precision greater than any surgeon&#44; in only ten plagues Godmethodically embarrassed the supposed gods of Egypt. </span></p>

<p><span lang='en'>In nine verses&#44; we have the condition of Pharaoh&apos;s heart described: hard. The Scripture says that the Lord hardened Pharaoh&apos;s heart&#44; but also that Pharaoh hardened hisown heart. God is able to turn the heart of kings without breaking the law of Free-Will.</span></p>
<p><span lang='en'>It was because of Pharaoh&apos;s own choices that such terrible things came upon Egypt andGod took this opportunity not only to bring judgment on Egypt for hermistreatment of Israel&#44; but also to humble her. There is only one God who madeHeaven and earth and there is NO God besides Him. This fact was undeniablyestablished by God&apos;s great deliverance of the Hebrew slaves. </span></p>
