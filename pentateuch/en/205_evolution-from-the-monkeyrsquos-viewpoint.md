<h1>Evolution From The Monkey&#39;s Viewpoint</h1>

<p>Three monkeys sat in a coconut tree</p>
<p>Discussing things as they&#39;re said to be.</p>
<p>Said one to the others, &quot;Now listen you two,</p>
<p>There&#39;s a certain rumor that can&#39;t be true.</p>
<p>That man descended from our noble race.</p>
<p>The very idea! It&#39;s a dire disgrace.</p>
<p>No monkey ever deserted his wife,</p>
<p>Starved his baby and ruined her life.</p>
<p>And you&#39;ve never known a mother monk,</p>
<p>To leave her baby with others to bunk,</p>
<p>Or pass them on from one to the other,</p>
<p>Till they hardly know who is their mother.</p>
<p>And another thing you&#39;ll never see</p>
<p>A monk build a fence around a coconut tree,</p>
<p>And let the coconuts go to waste,</p>
<p>Forbidding all other monks a taste.</p>
<p>Why, if I put a fence around this tree,</p>
<p>Starvation would force you to steal from me.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s another thing a monkey won&#39;t do,</p>
<p>Go out at night and get on a stew.</p>
<p>Or use a gun or club or knife,</p>
<p>To take some other monkey&#39;s life.</p>
<p>Yes! Man descended, the ornery cuss,</p>
<p>But, brother, he didn&#39;t descend from US!</p>
