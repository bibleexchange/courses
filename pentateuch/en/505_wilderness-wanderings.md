## Wilderness Wanderings

### The Murmurings (Chapter 14)

> Numbers 14:22â€”Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egyptand in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have nothearkened to my voice;

Much of what is recorded in Numbers is preserved for us not for the purpose of imitation but of warning!

(Numbers 14:22-- "ten times" literary form to express many times, over and over)

## The Red Heifer (Chapter 19)

> Numbers 19:2-This is the ordinance of the law which the LORDhath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring theea red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never cameyoke:

This chapter is only concerning the preparing and using of the ashes which were to infuse the water of purification. The people had complained of the strictness of the law, which forbade their near approach to the tabernacle,

> Num. 17:13-Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

In answer to this complaint, they are here directed to purify themselves, so as that they might come as far as they had occasion without fear.

### The method of preparing these ashes (Numbers 19:1-10)

### They were designed to purify persons from the pollution contracted by a dead body (Nu 19:11-16)

They were to be put into running water (a small quantity of them), with which the person to be cleansed must be purified, Nu 19:17-22. And that this ceremonial purification was a type andfigure of the cleansing of the consciences of believers from the pollutions of sin appears by the apostle's discourse, (Heb 9:13,14), where he compares the efficacy of the blood of Christ with the sanctifying virtue that was in"the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean."

There was a great deal of care employed in the choice of the heifer that was to be burnt, much more than in the choice of any other offering.

The heifer was to be slain without the camp, as an impure thing, which identifies the insufficiency of the methods prescribed by the ceremonial law to take awaysin. So far were they from cleansing effectually that they were themselvesunclean; as if the pollution that was laid upon them continued to cleave tothem. Yet, to answer this type, our Lord Jesus, being made sin and a curse for us, suffered without the gate (Heb 13:12).

### The heifer was to be wholly burnt (Nu 19:5)

This typified the extreme sufferings of our Lord Jesus, both insoul and body, as a sacrifice made by fire. The priest was to cast into thefire, while it was burning, cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet, which were used inthe cleansing of lepers (Le 14:6,7), that the ashes of these might be mingledwith the ashes of the heifer, because they were designed for purification.
