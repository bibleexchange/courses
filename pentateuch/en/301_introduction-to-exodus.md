<h2><span lang='en'>INTRODUCING EXODUS </span></h2>
<p><span lang='en'>The title of this Book comes from the Septuagint in which it is called &quot;Exodus&quot; which means &quot;going out.&quot;This title refers to the Israelite &quot;going out&quot; from Egypt. This book is called in Hebrew Bibles &quot;these are the names&quot; (Weelleh Shemoth) which is the opening clause of the book. The introductory genealogy shows how in a relatively short time&#44; Israel and His family greatly multiplied literally fulfilling God&apos;s promise to Abraham. The book of Exodus was probably once conjoined as one book with Genesis and comprises a period of about one hundred and forty-five years&#44; from the death of Joseph to the construction of the tabernacle in the desert. </span></p>
