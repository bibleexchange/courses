## INTRODUCING EXODUS

The title of this Book comes from the Septuagint in which it is called "Exodus" which means "going out."This title refers to the Israelite "going out" from Egypt. This book is called in Hebrew Bibles "these are the names" (Weelleh Shemoth) which is the opening clause of the book. The introductory genealogy shows how in a relatively short time, Israel and His family greatly multiplied literally fulfilling God's promise to Abraham. The book of Exodus was probably once conjoined as one book with Genesis and comprises a period of about one hundred and forty-five years, from the death of Joseph to the construction of the tabernacle in the desert.
