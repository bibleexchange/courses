Job:
The author is unknown, probably written by Moses; it is the earliest known written book, probably. 
People seem to flock to the book of Psalms more than any other book, both Christians and sinners alike. 
Proverbs is about wisdom, but Psalms seems to have a great amount of comfort. 
The book of Job was probably written from Abraham to the Exile; 
The place it was written from the Land of Oz.
The main subject: Problems of Jobs afflictions and why do good people suffer
The summery of the book: the issues of suffering and how we are supposed to understand it. 
There must be an absolute understanding that the truth that you will receive here is information/wisdom of the Word that you will not receive other places; and the devil will come after you even harder. 
Until experience is applied to the knowledge you gain than it is just head knowledge. 
The trial of our faith being much more precious than gold…
God can use anybody that He wants to bless us. 
The story revolves around suffering and losing it all. 
The key: rejoicing in suffering 
Stuff can be replaced but people cannot be replaced. 
In the times of suffering you need to square your shoulders and become a solider of the cross. 
It is bad enough to be suffering by losing all, than losing his family, than his very own body being afflicted and his own wife not with him. What suffering; 
The devil will use anything that he can to keep you away from church. If you are looking for any excuse not to come to church, the devil will surely supply you with one. 
An excuse is a skin of a reason stuffed with a lie. 
Be faithful with the small things, and than the Lord will exalt you with the greater things. If you cannot be faithful with the small things, than you aren’t worth anything;
Don’t you know who Jesus Christ really is? Than why do your actions not show it?
We must have that mindset that I will trust Him and trust his Word through everything. 
 Engulf yourself with the Word of God. – Get it down into your heart, cemented; it will keep you. 
The Key Verses: Job 13:15; 19:25, 26; 
Natural reason cannot comprehend spiritual truth; it is spiritually discerned. 
The Spirit and the Word agree; Why such? Because knowing this will help keep you from false doctrine;
Grandpa lays a great example for us; He is a man dedicated to the Word of God. 
If you are rowing the boat than you will have no time to rock it;
Thou he slay me, yet will I trust him…
Job Prestige (1:1-5)
His fortune we find in verse 3; 
He had faith, He had a fortune, and He had a family; 
Run the bases correctly; (God-Family-Job-Heaven) But sometimes we are looking to get a job and than fit God in there. Sometimes we are looking for a family and than God we will fit in. – Ohh, the trouble
Get everything you can from God in Bible School; Get God first and establish your faith; 

Job’s Pain (1:6-22 – 2:8…)
1:13-19 {the first wave of pain; 
1:6-12 – 2:1-6 {the reason for the trial; the devil will help you to lead you into temptation; 
The mind is like a computer and what you put in, is stored forever unless a miracle of God is performed.
There was no one more highly stricken like Jesus Christ; 
It is not in big numbers or high offerings, 
The reason for the trials is because there was confrontation between God and Satan; and there will be no temptation that you cannot bear, because what you bear the Lord knows and has equipped you 


Job’s Pity 

10-20-05
Philippians 4:11-13
As ministers of the Gospel there will be times of blessings and times of cursing, times of joys and times of tears, but through every situation we must learn to be content. 
Remember that with everything that comes our way is allowed through Jesus Christ, and He knows what we are able to bear. 

- The First Wave: Job lost everything tangible: heritage, homes, children, cattle, servants
Praise the Lord through your trials. 
Murphy’s Law: Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong. 
- The Second Wave: His person is attacked
A boil is usually a bad blood, 
All the trials resulted because of a confrontation between the devil and the Lord. 
Job 12:1

Nothing will happen to you unless it is first approved by the Lord. 
Hebrews 11:32-40; James 1:2-3; I Peter 1:7; 4:12
A great testimony is that when you go through a hard, hard trial you go through it. 
Going into the ministry is a wonderful thing, but you will never receive more trials, heartache, and pain. You need to be prayed up, filled up, and your faith strong. 

A lot of people don’t want to know more truth; they just want to stay where they are. People who are in the way and have been in the way for 50 years and are going to stay in the way. 

Memorize I Corinthians 10:12, 13

When you deal with leadership; everything will rise and fall with leadership. Rising and falling like a mountain. You may be falling but falling forward and not backwards. We need pillars in the church and people who will push the vision. 
You cannot do it by yourself; but you need people who can help you, help each other. 
You will come into the world with nothing and leave this world with nothing.
God has called us to be servants and not to serve. We are called to be a Shepard; 
We need to pour ourself into these people; and not feathering our own nests. To many people are trying to make a name for themselves, but remember what you sow you shall reap. 
In this church age it is about networking; 
Through every trial, Job never blamed God in the trial. 

In my situation, I pushed, pushed, pushed; the church, I didn’t get hardly any sleep, didn’t eat much, I forsook my family, And I got so wrapped up in ministry that I lost my call for God. It is God’s church and not your church, do it God’s way. 
Learn to trust the Lord; 
LISTEN to the Holy Ghost. 
If you get out of the Will of God, than you will pay;
Solomon didn’t want riches and fame but he just wanted wisdom to lead his people.
Lost my laptop, my instruments, my home, my family, my cloths, and than they for 7 days they just sit there and stare at him. These were his friends. 
Until you have walk in someone’s footsteps than you have to be very careful how you deal with them.
Jesus said to the woman go and sin no more; He said there was no accusers, neither Him; He dealt with the issue straight on, he dealt with the issue yet with compassion. 
Holiness in living is more than just looking the part. It is more than just something you do it is something that you are. 
If the fruit is not on the tree, it is worthless and needs to be cut down; But also remember that it is not your job to cut down the tree.
If we are going to be a family we need to work together. 


11-3-05
God sees past, present and future all at the same time. You belong to him. 
I don’t think there is anything more devastating than losing your children and Job lost all his children on one day. 
Just because trials and tribulations and hard times come does not mean you have done something wrong necessarily. 
Gold is a type of deity. 
We get too comfortable in this world. This is not our home. 
Instead of pointing a finger at someone else, remember there are three more pointing back at you. 
When you go through hard times, remember to put a smile on your face. And not just a superficial smile;
Job’s Despair 3:1-26
You can make it where God has called you. You will face oppositions in ministry; you are trying to do what you can to obey God, and people will come against you and try to stop you. 
How you react to oppositions will have a determining factor how you will succeed.
Bible School is not the end but just the beginning.
If we are not careful we can read the book of Job with an attitude. 
Faith Movement: Blab it and grab it, name it and frame it
Many times we don’t consider what our brother is going through;
Philippians 4:7
Galatians 6:1-3
Put the things that Job went through and apply them through your life. 
Condemnations 4:1-5
The most painful blows are the blows from your friends. It hurts more when it comes from someone that you love. 
A lot of times certain people just love to stir up trouble. 
Now his friends considered just because he was going through troubles is the result of some sin in his life. 
Beware of the people that will prophesy over you and say this and that concerning you. God told me thus and thus. God will not reveal things that are not truthful to that individual. 
Spirituality is not determined by how great we can sing, how good we worship and even how load we preach. 
Spirituality is based on our walk with God and our lives producing fruit. 
What are we leaving behind, footprints (someone’s blessing or something – dipped his foot in oil – in the Bible) 
Oil a type of the joy of the Holy Spirit 
Wherever you walk you will leave a footprint, but what kind of footprint? Oil or just mud
Matthew 7:

11-10-05
Spirituality is based on our walk with God and the fruit we are bearing. 
Maybe we are not called to judge but we are called to be fruit inspectors. And if a tree is not bearing good fruit, we must remember that we are not called to lay the axe to it either. 
Fruits and works are not the same thing. 
…by their works we shall know them…
Proverbs 1:31; Proverbs 11:30; Isaiah 3:10; Hebrews 13:15; Romans 7:4, 5; Galatians 5:22, 23; 
James 3:17, 18; Ephesians 5:9; 
Galatians 5:20
Fruit is this: Faith is… Temperance is…
We need to be fruit inspectors, but we need to make sure that our fruit is right. 
We need to have push – pull ministries. (pull your brothers up, and push them that are above us)
Flesh is flesh no matter whose bones it is on. 
We need to build one another up in the Lord. The things that you face here is on a small scale. And in the ministry, you are dealing with people, and when you are dealing with people, you will deal with conflict. 
Temperance: self-control
I Corinthians 12:
Right after he deals with the gifts, I Corinthians 13:, He deals with love – without love gifts are sounding brass and tinkling cymbals
To edify means to build up; Anyone can come in and tear it down, but we are called to build up
We need to know His voice – my sheep know His voice (not be called to spiritual giants, but to touch lives and to make a difference: Our mission and goal is to win souls for Christ)
Chapter 4:18-21
Chapter 5:
Prosperity is not a taboo thing, it is not a bad thing; but just because your rich or poor doesn’t make you more spiritual. 
Job argues that the greatness of sorrows gives him the right to complain. 
Chapter 6:
I wish that God would kill me. Have you ever been to the place, that you just want your next breath to be your last breath.
Philippians 4:7, 8
The devil condemns, and the spirit of God convicts. 
We must be bringing forth fruit, 

11-17-05
Memorize Job 19:25, 26
Job as blameless and upright man 
Job falls to the ground and worships God in the midst of finding out that he has lost everything. 
A lot of preachers face hard times, and give it all up. 
When the hard times come, worship God. 
A secure person, when they are going through hard times, does not give up, but trusts God. 
Going into the ministry is not going to be rosy, but it will be difficult. 
If you are going through weeks and months of no problems than there is something wrong. 
Three cycles of debate;

Leadership Lessons in the book of Job:
Mature leaders maintain perspective especially when going through hard times

Good leaders remain teachable and choose their leaders wisely
You don’t want “yes men” on your board, they will not let you know, when you are in trouble. They will cuddle you in your sin. 
Be careful who you go to counsel, and gather wisdom from. 

Integrity and character are the foundations of leadership
Be the same person that you are here that you are in home

Never pretend to know all the answers
We can live without knowing all the answers. 

Effective leaders make adjustments when things go wrong.
Leadership qualities don’t come from the world, but come from God. 


David had lids, and Saul had lids; 
We all have stuff in our lives and we can hide behind the stuff. We need to get out from amongst the stuff. 
The one that God chooses is the 
If you keep looking at yourself in the natural, you will never see yourself as capable. Who God calls, He equips.
One became a great leader, the other did not. David submitted and Saul did not submit. 
Saul ruled out of his position, and did not have real effect. You can not lead out of your position; you lead of integrity and character. 
God exalts and God positions. You must remain humble to the Lord in every position. 
He takes the simple things of the world to confound the wise.
It is not a matter of position; it is a matter of helping people and leading people to Christ. 
It is not a matter of being right and winning an argument but rather persuading them and leading them to Christ. 

The law of connection: Leaders touch the heart before they ask for a hand.
To lead yourself you use your head / To lead others you use your heart. 
Move them with emotion and not false emotion – Leaders connect with people
It is difficult to connect people, when you are looking for a position. 
Use these tools and use these gifts. 
Be faithful in the small things, and He will use you in the great things. 

You will never accomplish anything in your own. You must be in the place that He can use you. 

A most urgent requirement for being a leader: What am I doing for others?
You are not called to be served; you are called to “be a servant”. Bring a person up to a position with Christ. Too many people have left the call of God and got into the business of the church. 
“If doesn’t come from the outside, it must come from the inside” – Sis. Gibson
Don’t go looking for positions: You are called to preach: God will place you where he desires. 

“To make an impact on people be a river and not a reservoir”

A sponge can only hold so much; and if it is not rung out and soaked back in than you will begin to stick. 
Moses had to learn to lead sheep before he could lead the Israelites. 
Sometimes we feel like we are shoveling sand against the tide. 
Encourage one another and serve one another. 


12-1-05
Don’t ever think that leadership is everything. But the driving force is the spirit of life inspiring your words to meet the soul of men. 
Wait on God; get a message from God, to bring to the people. 
You must be river and not a reservoir. Waiting on God, 
People are looking at you as the future leaders of the church. 
People wait around for people to open doors it won’t happen. You have to wait on God, to open the doors for you, and for you to walk through them. 
Be a river, get it out there, and don’t allow it to be stagnant in your life. 
There is earthly wisdom and than there is heavenly wisdom. 
Now is the time that you dig your toes in the sand, and get dedicated, and get ready for ministry. 
Be prepared, and be ready now! Opportunity will not wait, even while you pray. 
Get connected to that heavenly connection. 
We need that wisdom from above, and it does not come from natural sources. 
Thou he slay you, trust him. – You will have to die, for him to use you. 
If God calls you to do something, then he will equip you to do that task. 
Big dreams, big visions – we all have, but we usually fall flat on our face, though we say we will do it better than anyone else. 
Have you given up you life up for the cause;
Galatians 2:20 …I am crucified with Christ…
Don’t get in the mindset of the business aspect of the church. 
Wherever God calls you; you go…if you have to live in a shack, than do the will of God. 
The ministry is not a business; it is calling to share the Gospel. 
Sacrifice for God, really sacrifice for God…
If your not called, If your sold out to God, If your not hearing his voice…Than you will not make it. 
God cannot be on the outside of your ministry, is He constantly abiding. 
We live a feathered life, but is that real, true sacrifice. 
Is the Word of God established in your life? 
Be oh so careful about reading any old book, many authors, many ideas and many false ideas. 
Unless you have the mind of God, than you will deal correctly; You cannot judge correctly unless you living correctly. 
We need a heart connection with our audience. 
A good communicator seeks to understand, before they are understood. 
Respect: 
James Reynolds, we saw a man dedicated and committed to him. 
We should be in so in tune with God, that when He speaks everything stops and you listen and obey. 
Learn submissiveness to authority, lift up our leaders, work under them and see this work go forward. 

12-15-05
Leaders think differently than followers. 
A renewed perspective; He was able to let go of his past. 
When the devil reminds you of your past, remind him of his future. 
James 3:11-18

“Whatever you win them with, you must keep them with.”

Praying and praying through is so important. You will hardly hear it anymore. 
Though circumstances fail, and troubles come your way, you must remain consistent. 
Not everybody will enjoy your talent and ability. Usually that will get you in the door. 
But unless you have the anointing and power it will not last. 
Self-understanding that I am nothing without Christ;
Remember that there is always someone better then you. 

They don’t know how to pray and pray through and they run on talent and ability and fail.

Without a vision the people parish;
Instead of pretending to be in control, model a life being under control. 
We must fall under the authority that God has set us under. Be a help and not a hindrance. 

Don’t let your ego get in the way. People start exalting you, and they want to separate and start their own church with you – dear God. Be vary, vary, vary careful. 
People will try to wine and dine you to get some kind of control of the reigns. 
David never took the throne from David, because he recognized Saul’s authority. 
Under authority God will bless you. 

→ We are workers together
It is not how big it is, it is obeying the Lord. 
Be thankful to be under the reigns for now. Should you be in authority that is so much responsibility. 

Sheep are dumb understand they have limitations. 
Leaders must model life; living from character and not from life. 

In a marriage, sometimes, no matter what you do it is wrong. Don’t allow your emotions to get the best of you. 
Don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. 
A Key: Keep going; keep working, never let up for a moment
Push with them; Pull with them – Work together and not against them
Colossians 1:27 
Fills you to completion – You need the Holy Ghost
Job 39:1-7
A danger every spiritual leader faces: Don’t pretend to know everything
Eschatology: Dealing with the end times events / People use big words to talk to you.
You don’t need to project self confidence. But know who you are in Christ. 
Don’t ever get too big to be too small to say you are sorry. And don’t sweep it under the rug, because it will show itself. 
Good leaders feel secure enough to repent when they are wrong. 
Like all great leaders he refuses to give vengeance and hold grudges. 

The Low road: takes revenge; plays the same game as others play, step on anybody to get on top; guided by feeling; reactive, no better than anybody else
The High road: makes action of unconditional love and forgiveness; refuses to play games and lives on principles; guided by character and values; proactive, lives above human standards, more than God has equipped you. 

If you look at your limitations, than you will always feel limited and be limited. 

Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. 
The most looked up dictionary word on the internet was integrity.
