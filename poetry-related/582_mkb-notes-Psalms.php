PSALMS
Whether we are on the mountain or in the valley, we know that God does not change. There are many, many variables in our life, but God has no variables.  
Psalm 139

Our hearts are wicked continually, but David asks the Lord to search his heart. And asks the Lord to take out any wicked way in him;

If you concentrate on your negative, than that is all that you will have. Don’t be jealous because someone else has a gift that you do not have. 

Before He called you, He knew everything about you, all you failures, all your lacks, all your shortcomings, all your talents and lack of talents. And he called you anyways. 

If you see a shadow, remember there has to be light somewhere. 

One preacher actually said, “The biggest failure that you will ever find is God”


It is God’s absolute character, God is holy, it is an attribute of God, imputed to us.
Holiness is not a list of don’ts.
Holiness is the Holy Spirit working in you and causing you not want to do these things. 
Holiness is not what we put on; it is what is in the inside that comes on the outside. 

Think about it: study it: What is Holiness? 

There are times of worship, praise, and accountability. 

Trust God for the small things now, than you can know how to trust God for the big things.
