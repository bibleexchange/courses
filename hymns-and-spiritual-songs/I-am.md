# I Am

## CHORUS

	I am, I am, I am, I am

## VERSE 1

	I am the Lord, I’m the Almighty God
	I am the One for whom nothing is too hard
	I am the Shepherd and I am the Door
	I am the Good news to the bound and the poor

## VERSE 2

	I am the righteous One and I am the Lamb
	I am the Ram in the bush for Abraham
	I am the Ultimate Sacrifice for sin
	I am your Redeemer, the Beginning and the End

## VERSE 3

	I am Jehovah, and I am your King
	I am Messiah, David’s Offspring
	I am your High Priest, and I am the Christ
	I am the Resurrection, I am the Life

## VERSE 4

	I am the Bread, and I am the Wine,
	I am your Future, so leave your past behind
	I am the One in the midst of two or three
	I am your Tabernacle, I am your Jubilee

## VERSE 5

	I am Hope, I am Peace, I am Joy, I am Rest
	Oh I am your Comfort, and Relief from your stress
	I am Strength, I am Faith, I am Love, I am Power
	And I am your Freedom, this very hour
