COME LET US BREAK BREAD
 
Verse 1: The Cross became a table as they lay it on the ground,
And upon it they placed the Bread of Life as Jesus lay down,
With swords and with spears the soldiers gathered round,
A hammer was raised to drive those nails in their place,
If as though the soldiers said.
 
Verse 2; He said take this cup and as oft as you drink think of me
And remember this blood that was shed for you from me
And take this bread and break it like they broke me
The Blood's for your cleansing, the bread's for your healing
Come have communion with me.
 
Chorus: Come let us break bread
Come let us break bread
As we gather together at the Lord's table
Come let us break bread.
