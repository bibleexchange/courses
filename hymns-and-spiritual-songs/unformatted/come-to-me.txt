Come to me key-C
Verse 1
I tried to forget the joy that I once had
That came from knowing Christ
No matter how far I strayed
i never  could escape his grace, it's so amazing 
how could he still love me after all that I have done
Yet he embraced me with his Arms of love
I heard the voice of mercy saying
Chorus
Come to me just as you are
Come to me and I will heal your broken heart
Forgiveness can be found if you'll only believe
All you have to do is come me
Verse 2
You Try to disguise the guilt hidden deep inside
 by putting on a smile
Held captive by your past You wonder if the pain will last forever
The peace of mind  your searching for is not so far away
If you will listen carefully to the saviors voice 
you'll hear him saying
