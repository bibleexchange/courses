The Journey Kenny Hinson Let me take you on a journey Let me warn you before we start This won’t be no picnic We’re not strolling through the park In your own imagination See the awful sights unfold When we reach our destination Deep inside a sinner’s soul See these tears that’s formed these rivers That go rushing through his eyes In this the valley of heartache ‘Neath a mountain of eyes Here the fields are cold and barren Only yielding endless shame And on the walls of ____________ canyon Sin has carved its name Now let us press a little deeper Where a million dreams have died And did you hear that old grim reaper Suggesting suicide Smell the smoke, feel the flames Lord, Hell’s volcano’s ‘bout to blow Ain’t it a cryin’ shame It never let him know And when we leave there will be no souvenirs for anyone to claim Cause the only thing were taking is the blame 
THE LOVE OF GOD 1. The love of God is greater far Than tongue or pen can ever tell; It goes beyond the highest star, And reaches to the lowest hell; The guilty pair, bowed down with care, God gave His Son to win; His erring child He reconciled, And pardoned from his sin. 2. When years of time shall pass away, And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall, When men, who here refuse to pray, On rocks and hills and mountains call, God's love so sure, shall still endure, All measureless and strong; Redeeming grace to Adam's race The saints' and angels' song. 3. Could we with ink the ocean fill, And were the skies of parchment made, Were every stalk on earth a quill, And every man a scribe by trade, To write the love of God above, Would drain the ocean dry. Nor could the scroll contain the whole, Though stretched from sky to sky. Chorus: O love of God, how rich and pure! How measureless and strong! It shall forevermore endure The saints' and angels' song. 

The Middle Man 
VERSE 1 There was a mountain and there were three trees There was a good man and there were two thieves A man called Barabbas was doomed for the tree But Jesus took the middle one and Barabbas went free CHORUS I love that man in the middle because I know he first loved me Praise to that man who died on mount Calvary The Middle Man made it possible that I could go free VERSE 2 A hill called Golgotha the place of a skull No yellow flowers no trees in bloom the scenery was so dull Three crosses stood black and bold against a darkened sky And not from pain but a broken heart that middle man died 
1. Refrain: So I'll cherish the old rugged cross, till my trophies at last I lay down; I will cling to the old rugged cross, and exchange it some day for a crown. 2. O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, has a wondrous attraction for me; for the dear Lamb of God left his glory above to bear it to dark Calvary. (Refrain) 3. In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, a wondrous beauty I see, for 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died, to pardon and sanctify me. (Refrain) 4. To that old rugged cross I will ever be true, its shame and reproach gladly bear; then he'll call me some day to my home far away, where his glory forever I'll share. (Refrain) 
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross, the emblem of suffering and shame; and I love that old cross where the dearest and best for a world of lost sinners was slain. 
THERE'S A MIRACLE IN THE MAKING 1) The crowd was great but she knew she had to reach Him. For it was her last hope of ever being healed. So she pressed through until she touched his garment Oh, and right then and there, her miracle was fulfilled. 2) Have you prayed and prayed and still you find no answer. Has your faith grown weak and you feel you're all alone? Don't give up for the God you serve won't leave you. There's a miracle for you, just keep holding on. Chorus There's a miracle in the making One for you the Father is working even now. Your prayers have been heard and the answer is on the way There's a miracle in the making for you today. 
Thou, Oh Oh Lord, Art a Shield for Me 
Thou, Oh Lord Many are they increased that troubled me Many are they that rise up against me Many there be which say of my soul There is no helpe for him in God But thou, oh Lord are a shield for me My glory and the lifter of my head Thou, oh Lord are shield for me My glory and the lifter of my head Repeat I cried unto the Lord with my voice And he heard me out of His holy hill I laid me down and slept and awaked For the Lord sustained, for he sustained me Thou, oh Lord are a shield for me My glory and the lifter of my head Thou, oh Lord are shield for me My glory and the lifter of my head 
Refrain: I need Thee, O I need Thee; Every hour I need Thee; O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee. 
TOO MUCH TO GAIN TO LOSE 1. too many miles behind me Too many trails are through Too many tears help me remember There's to much to gain to lose. Chorus Too many sunsets lie behind the mountain Too many rivers my feet have walked through Too many treasures are waiting over yonder There's too much to gain to lose. 2. i've crossed the hot burning dessert I was struggling the right road to choose But somewhere up ahead there's cool clear water And defeat is one word i'll never use. Tag: Oh, too many treasures are waiting over yonder There's too much to gain to lose! 
'Twas a Day in Early Springtime 
G 1. ’Twas a day in early springtime, By an ancient wayside well, Eliezer paused to rest his camel train. He had found a bride for Isaac Ere the evening shadows fell, For his weary journey had not been in vain. Chorus: Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall. Don’t you hear the Eliezer call? There’s going to be a wedding, And our joy will soon begin, In the evening when the camel train comes in. 2. So he took the fair Rebekah, Dressed in jewels rich and rare, Quickly to her waiting bridegroom far away. Where Rebekah loved her Isaac, And he loved Rebekah fair; Oh, it must have been a happy wedding day. 3. Now the blessed Holy Spirit, From our Father God above, Has come down to earth to find a worthy Bride. For our Isaac over yonder Has prepared His tents of love, And He wants His fair Rebekah by His side. 4. We have left our kinfolk gladly; We have bade the world goodbye. We’ve been called to be His pure and spotless Bride; Where we’ll soon behold our Jesus In that blest eternity-- What a happy, happy wedding that will be! v Gen. 24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

We’ve Been Made More than Conquerors CHORUS We’ve been made more than conquerors Overcomers in this life We’ve been made victorious Through the blood of Jesus Christ VERSE 1 When troubles come knockin’ at your door Don’t be afraid you know it’s not like before Don’t you give in don’t let it bring ya down You don’t have to worry anymore VERSE 2 Hold on we’re getting stronger ev’ry day There’s no reason for you to go astray Don’t go leaning to your understanding ’cause you don’t have to worry anyway 



Whatever It Takes 
VERSE 1 There's a voice calling me From an old rugged tree And it whispers, "draw closer to me" Leave this world far behind There are new heights to climb And a new place in me you will find. CHORUS: For whatever it takes to draw closer to you, Lord That's what I'll be willing to do. For whatever it takes to be more like you That's what I'll be willing to do. VERSE 2 Take my houses and lands Change my dreams and my plans For I'm placing my whole life in your hand. And if you call me today To a land far away Lord I'll go and your will obey. <CHORUS> VERSE 3 Take the dearest thing in me If that's how it must be To draw me closer to you. Let the disappointments come Lonely days without the sun If through sorrows more like you I'll become. 




When He Reached Down His Hand for Me 
VERSE 1 Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be But my Savior in love, gave me peace from above When he reached down His hand for me CHORUS When the Savior reached down for me When he reached down His hand for me I was lost and undone, without God or His Son When he reached down His hand for me VERSE 2 I was near to despair when He came to me there And He showed me that I could be free Then He lifted my feet, gave me gladness complete When He reached down His hand for me VERSE 3 How my heart doth rejoice when I hear His sweet voice And the tempest to Him I can flee There to lean on His arms, safe secure from all harm Since he reached down his hand for me

Writer-Billy Fields Publisher-Fields for Harvest 
When I Lay My Isaac Down Abraham prayed for the day God would give him a son Blessed Isaac was his name The greatest gift he’d ever known Then came the day, who would have dreamed God would say “Give him to me On this mountain you will prove, It’s you and Isaac, or it’s me and you” When I lay my Isaac down Broken heart but my Fathers proud On this altar here he lays Just to find it wasn’t him, he wanted me Most of us I’d dare to say Have an Isaac in God’s way On the Altar God will prove It’s not your Isaac that he wants He wants you 
On this altar here he lays Just to find it wasn’t him, he wanted me 
A BEAUTIFUL LIFE 
1. Each day I’ll do a golden deed, By helping those who are in need; My life on earth is but a span, And so I’ll do the best I can. ? Refrain: Life’s evening sun is sinking low, A few more days, and I must go To meet the deeds that I have done, Where there will be no setting sun. 2. To be a child of God each day, My light must shine along the way; I’ll sing His praise while ages roll, And strive to help some troubled soul. 3. The only life that will endure, Is one that’s kind and good and pure; And so for God I’ll take my stand, Each day I’ll lend a helping hand. 
4. I’ll help someone in time of need, And journey on with rapid speed; I’ll help the sick and poor and weak, And words of kindness to them speak. 
5. While going down life’s weary road, I’ll try to lift some trav’ler’s load; I’ll try to turn the night to day, Make flowers bloom along the way. 
And friends are friends forever 
If the Lord’s the Lord of them 
And a Friend will not say never 
Cause the welcome will not end 
Though its hard to let you go 
In the Father’s hands we know 
That a lifetime’s not too long 
To live as friends 
Verse 1: Here I stand upon this path With the rocks beneath my feet I fail to read the signs That pointed to the way that’s straight My head bowed low My spirit groans I know not what to do But my heart cries out, “I’ll just go back to the Place where I prayed through” Chorus: I’m going back to the altar again Down on my knees where God’s mercy began I’m going back to where I found life anew I’m going back to the place where I prayed through Verse 2: Now I stand before the cross By the blood completely free I can feel that sweet forgiveness Like a flood wash over me I raise my hands to worship And be thankful for the day I had courage to go back To the place where I prayed through

Fresh Oil 
V1. For so long the church has been, in a dry and barren place. There's no oil in our vessel, there's no burden to save. Its lost and dying world, that needs the Lord today. We must fall on our face, and press on to be refreshed. Chorus We need fresh oil, striaght from the throne. We a holyghost annointing and that fire in our bones. We need the power of the Lord, working in our lives. We need fresh oil, straight from the throne. Tag. Lord help me to surrender, my all to you. So that you can fill my life with fresh oil, to be used for you.. 





GO REACH THE WORLD 
VERSE 1 It all starts with just one voice That takes a stand, that makes a choice To live for God and not hesitate To tell the world about amazing grace. VERSE 2 One day that seed somehow breaks through, Where there was one, there now stands two. And soon another takes his hand A ray of hope that spreads across the land. VERSE 3 Across the mountains, across the sea, Soon others join in harmony. They found the cross still standing strong And soon a mighty chorus sings along. Chorus: Go reach the world, touch one more soul Bring one more lamb back to the fold. Each soul another flag unfurled. Each voice another chance to reach the world. VERSE 4 Don't let me pray, Lord for wealth or fame A spark that sets the world a flame. But help me reach the lost and alone, To tell of joy and hope where hope is gone, Where hope is gone.

VERSE 1: 
While shepherds kept their watching Over silent flocks by night, Behold throughout the heavens, There shone a holy light: Go, Tell It On The Mountain, Over the hills and everywhere; Go, Tell It On The Mountain That Jesus Christ is born. 

VERSE 2: 
The shepherds feared and trembled When lo! above the earth Rang out the angel chorus That hailed our Saviour's birth: Go, Tell It On The Mountain, Over the hills and everywhere; Go, Tell It On The Mountain That Jesus Christ is born. 

VERSE 3: 
Down in a lowly manger Our humble Christ was born And God send us salvation, That blessed Christmas morn: Go, Tell It On The Mountain, Over the hills and everywhere; Go, Tell It On The Mountain That Jesus Christ is born. 
Go Tell It On the Mountain VERSE 4: 

When I am a seeker, I seek both night and day; I seek the Lord to help me, And He shows me the way: Go, Tell It On The Mountain, Over the hills and everywhere; Go, Tell It On The Mountain That Jesus Christ is born.

Going Back 
1. What ever happened to death do us part, Does the home reflect the heart, Parents faces tell of worried minds, While children search but can't seem to find. It's time we took a closer look, Got back to living by the Holy book, No compromise without getting slack, You see, we'll go forward if we'll just go back. 2. We'll know the tree by the fruit we see, Serving God has no in-between, we're either cold or we're hot, He said luke warm will have no part. It's coming down to in or out, There's no time for playing around, We're going back to lost or found, We're going back to stand our ground. 3. Then we'll rise like a sleeping giant, Standing tall in God's strength and might, The power we've claimed for go long, You see it's returning, we're being made strong. We're not looking to the right or the left, Our eyes are spirit lead, We're going back to true or false, Church we've got to go back to Calvary's Cross. Cho. We've got to go back to living true, We're going back to the absolute, Back to where the church stood strong, Back to where there's a right there is a wrong, Back to where it's black or white, You see the difference is like day and night, we're going back to things above, We're going back to our first love. 
Got any rivers you think are impossible? Got any mountains you can not tunnel thorough? God specialzes in things thought impossilbe And he can do what no other God can do. I learned this song about 50 years ago 1. Be of good courage God spake unto joshua, When o'er the river God pointed the way. Jordan uncrossable! things seemed impossible, Waters divide as they march and obey. Chorus: Got any rivers you think are uncrossable? Got any mountains you can't tunnel through? God specializes in things thought impossible: He can do what no others can do. 2. Battles to win! they would meet their obstacles, Jericho's walls, too, must fall to the ground. God never failed; He stood back of His promises, Walls had to crumble as the marched around. 3. God is the same and His word is dependable; He'll make a wat through the waters for you. Life's situations by Him are amendable, Mountains and hills He will part for you too. 





Grace 
VERSE 1 I was in prison, locked up in chains sin held me captive To sorrow and pain, years of frustrations as love passed me by Until the Master heard my hearts cry CHORUS For grace marvelous grace, I needed grace to pardon and make Me whole grace marvelous grace flows from above with infinite love Marvelous grace VERSE 2 I was downhearted I was broken inside praying for mercy with Nowhere to hide, there was a solace searching for me grace Everflowing that set my soul free BRIDGE Grace, Grace God's Grace grace that will pardon and cleanse within Grace, Grace God's Grace grace that is greater than all our sins TAG For Grace marvelous grace flows from above with infinite love Marvelous Grace 
He Already Sees 
VERSE 1. When the storm raged about them The disciples were afraid For the waves were high and the ship was tossed They could not find their way Then they awoke the Master Saying Lord please save us now He rebuked the winds and the sea grew calm And they all wondered how CHORUS. God sees the storm from the other side He knows the lessons learned And just beyond the clouds He sees clear skies He speaks peace to the raging storm When peace cannot be found He already sees the rainbow when we see only clouds VERSE 2 Like the man on the sea did I have called on God in prayer When it seemed to me all hope was gone And in my deep despair I remembered what the Lord said When He calmed that troubled sea And I know once more how He sees the storm And peace floods over me BRIDGE And when the storms of life come crashing in and trouble me I can feel God's arms around me and He whispers Let it be, Let it be 
He Will Do it Again Lyrics: VERSE 1 You may be down and feel like God Has somehow forgotten That you are faced with circumstances You can?t get through But now it seems that there?s no way out And you?re going under God?s proven time and time again He?ll take care of you CHORUS And He?ll do it again He?ll do it again If you?ll just take a look At where you are now And where you?ve been Well hasn?t He always come through for you He?s the same now as then You may not know how You may not know when But He?ll do it again VERSE 2 God knows the things you?re going through And He knows how you?re hurting You see he knows just how you?re heart Has been broken in two But He?s the God of the stars, of the sun and the sea And He is your Father You see He can calm the storm And He?ll find some way to fix it for you

I Bowed on My Knees and Cried, "Holy" CHORUS: Then I bowed on my knees and cried, "Holy, Holy, Holy." Then I clapped my hands and sang, "Glory, Glory to the Son of God." Then I bowed on my knees and cried, "Holy, Holy, Holy." Then I clapped my hands and sang, "Glory, Glory to the Son of God." VERSE 1: I dreamed of a city called Glory, So bright and so fair. When I entered that gate I cried, "Holy" The angels all met me there: They carried me from mansion to mansion, And oh what sights I saw. But I said, "I want to see Jesus, He's the One who died for all." VERSE 2: I thought as I entered that city, My friends all knew me well. They showed me the streets of Heaven; Such scenes too numerous to tell; I saw Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Mark, Luke and Timothy. But I said, "I want to see Jesus, He's the One who died for me." VERSE 3: I thought when I saw my Savior, O glory to God; I just fell right down before Him, singing, "Praise to the name of the Lord." I bowed down and worshipped Jehovah, my Friend of Calvary, for I wanted to give praise to Jesus for saving a sinner like me. 
I get joy joy joy when ithink about the Lord When Im standing in his presence I ask for more and more Hes moving in my hands Way down to my feet Oh there’s something about the Lord He gets al over When I think about his goodness I sake my lierty And I believe You don’t know like Iknow How good hes been to me Weli get oy like a rver 
I KEEP FALLING IN LOVE WITH HIM VERSE 1 O when I first fell in love with Jesus I gave Him all of my heart And I thought I couldn’t love Him more Than I did right from the start But when I look back at the mountains And valleys where I’ve been Then it makes me know that I love Him so Much more than I did then CHORUS I keep falling in love with Him Falling in love with Him Over and over again (2x) It gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by O what a love between the Lord and I I keep falling in love with Him Over and over again VERSE 2 There is a hand I can hold on to Through each valley and each trial And there’s a shoulder I can lean upon When I face another mile And there’s a love I can depend upon It’s fresh and new each day And with love my heart is overflowing That is why I say 



I Was There When It Happened 
Verse1 
Chorus 
Verse 2 
There are some people, who say we cannot tell, 
Whether we are saved or, whether all is well; 
They say we only can hope and, trust that it is so, 
But I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know. 
Yes,I know when Jesus saved me (saved my soul), 
The very moment He forgave me (made me whole); 
He took away my heavy burdens, Lord he gave me peace within(peace within) 
Satan can't make me doubt it, 
It's real and I'm gonna shout it 
I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know 
Now, I don't care who tells me, salvation is not real, 
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel; 
The heavy burdens lifted and the vile sins gone, 
But I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know. 



I’m Looking to Live 
CHORUS I'm looking to live I'm not looking to die I've focused my eyes on Jesus the Christ I don't feel the stones I don't see the crowd My mind is fixed on the heavenly crown If you're wondering why I'm looking on high I'm looking to live Verse 1 Stephen preached the gospel The world would not receive But Stephen had a vision In that vision Stephen believed As they stoned his dying body He got something in his eye He said I see the heavens open Jesus Standing at the fathers right side Verse 2 This world has tried to blind me Satan hopes I'll never see All The blessings of the gospel A vast inheritance for me He has come just a little too late now I've got something in my eye Sweet glory land awaiting Nothing else will ever satisfy 
IT’S ALL ABOUT THE BLOOD Marty Funderburke and Tammy Dunaway 
Verse 1 It’s not cathedrals, it’s not steeples/ Its not crosses made of gold/ It’s not just sentimental stories that have been passed down from old. It’s not religion or tradition that can save the souls of man. It took the sinless blood of one Holy Lamb. Chorus It’s all about the blood, it’s all about Calvary. It’s all about mercy flowing down an old rugged tree. It’s all about grace, it’s all about a sacrifice. God’s love is all about the blood of Jesus Christ. Verse 2 It’s the scarlet thread that ties the beginning to the end. It’s a river of forgiveness to wash away our sin.

IT’S ALL ABOUT THE BLOOD Marty Funderburke and Tammy Dunaway 
Verse 1 It’s not cathedrals, it’s not steeples/ Its not crosses made of gold/ It’s not just sentimental stories that have been passed down from old. It’s not religion or tradition that can save the souls of man. It took the sinless blood of one Holy Lamb. Chorus It’s all about the blood, it’s all about Calvary. It’s all about mercy flowing down an old rugged tree. It’s all about grace, it’s all about a sacrifice. God’s love is all about the blood of Jesus Christ. Verse 2 It’s the scarlet thread that ties the beginning to the end. It’s a river of forgiveness to wash away our sin. It’s a healing stream, a fountain An eternal cleansing flood and the heartbeat of the Gospel with forever be the blood. Chorus It’s all about the blood, it’s all about Calvary. / It’s all about mercy flowing down an old rugged tree. / It’s all about grace, it’s all about a sacrifice. / God’s love is all about the blood of Jesus Christ. Verse 3 What can wash away my sin? / Nothing but the blood of Jesus. / What can make me whole again? / Nothing but the blood of Jesus. / It’s all about grace, it’s all about a sacrifice./ God’s love is all about the blood of Jesus Christ. / God’s love is all about the blood of Jesus Christ 
VERSE 1 In my heart are kingdoms of A world that's all my own Kingdoms that are only seen By myself and God alone In the past when I tried to rule my world It just seemed to fall apart So please Jesus be the lord of all The kingdoms of my heart VERSE 2 I guess I only fool myself For I said I have yielded all But in a secret corner of my heart Was a kingdom that didn't fall I surrender now, make my heart your throne Rule it's kingdoms, great and small For if your not Lord of everything Then your not Lord at all

PAUL'S MINISTRY I. The Lord said, "Stand up, Paul, and dry up your tears You must preach My Gospel for many long years. Go down to Damascus, the street that's called Strait And meet Ananais, and there you must wait. Cho. I counted on Adam, I counted on Cain, I counted on Jonah, but he was the same. I counted on Judas, but he proved untrue So go tell the world Paul, I'm counting on you." II. Three days have gone by, Lord, and still I can't see And here comes my brother acalling for me. He says "Brother Paul, the Lord in the sky Has sent me to heal you, and to open your eyes." III. "I'll send you to the Gentiles, I'll send you to Rome, And Paul you will suffer 'till I call you home. You will sleep in the desert, and be shipwrecked at sea, But go right on preaching the Gospel for Me. 
One last verse to "Paul's Ministry". "Many years have gone by, Lord, and still I've been true. But I must leave this great field with you. I've finished my course, Lord, I've taught in Your name; I'm sure there are others who will do the same."

LITTLE DAVID CHORUS: "The battle's not mine," said Little David, "Lord, it's Thine, I'm in Your favor. I'm giving it all to You, I knew not what to do. I'm so glad You let me see, You're really all that I need. For the battle's not mine, I give it to You, Lord, it's Thine." 1. Little David looked so small, Goliath looked so tall, The odds were just too high for Little David. So he shook off all of his load for with the power of God he was bold, He said, "The battle's not mine, I give it to You, Lord, it's Thine." CHORUS: 2.

Love Went Deeper.gdoc Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there. O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream: 'Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a country should leave us no more? Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand, Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation; Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us a nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause is just, And this be our motto: "In God is our trust" And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Oh beautiful, for spacious skies, For amber waves of grain, For purple mountain majesties Above the fruited plain! America! America! God shed His grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea. Oh beautiful, for pilgrims' feet Whose stern, impassioned stress A thoroughfare for freedom beat Across the wilderness! America! America! God mend thine ev'ry flaw; Confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty in law! Oh beautiful, for heroes proved In liberating strife, Who more than self their country loved And mercy more than life! America! America! May God thy gold refine, 'Til all success be nobleness, and ev'ry gain divine! Oh beautiful, for patriot dream That sees beyond the years, Thine alabaster cities gleam Undimmed by human tears! America! America! God shed His grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea! 




Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord: He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword: His truth is marching on. Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah! Glory, glory, hallelujah! His truth is marching on. I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps, They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps: His day is marching on. I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel: "As ye deal with my contemnors’, so with you my grace shall deal; Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel, Since God is marching on." He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat: Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! Our God is marching on. In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me: As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, While God is marching on. He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave, He is Wisdom to the mighty, He is Succour to the brave, So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of Time His slave, Our God is marching on.

Rise Again 
VERSE 1: Go ahead drive the nails in My hands, Laugh at Me where you stand. Go ahead, and say it isn't Me, The day will come when you will see, CHORUS: 'Cause I'll rise again. There's no pow'r on earth can tie Me down. Yes, I'll rise again, Death can't keep Me in the ground. VERSE 2: Go ahead mock My name, My love for you is still the same.

Yes, I'll come again; Come to take My people back Yes I'll come again; Come to take My people back. 

VERSE 1 

Once in streets of Bethlehem 
There they stood all alone; 
The baby was coming 
And there was no place to go. 
They said there was no room 
For there’s too much going on 
We hate to send you off, 
But you’ll have to go without 
VERSE 2 

There was no great procession 
There was no robe or crown 
This King came down to earth 
For a cross and not a throne 
Though many will reject Him 
There’s still a faithful few 
Who will open up their hearts 
And enter life anew 
Room for the Saviour

Chorus Send the Rain, Send the fire, Send the wind, Send the Holy Ghost and Power, Send the Rain, Send the fire, Send the wind, Send the Holy Ghost and Power, Send the rain !

Verse 2 We're ready for revival Lord, We're ready to walk through that door, We're ready Lord Oh let it pour, We're ready Lord. We're ready Lord, Enough is enough, We're ready to drink from that cup, We're ready Lord, Oh fill us up, We're ready Lord
