There is Power In the Name of Jesus


Verse 1:


Mother barely twenty out there on her own,
A teenage boy in prison before he’s even grown,
The illness of a loved one, a widow no one calls,
But there is one solution, there’s an answer for it all.


Verse 2:


A nation needing mercy, we’re just fightin’ for our lives.
We’re a church needs revival; maybe a broken man and wife.
But in the name of Jesus all those chains of bondage fall,
You see, your prayers are heard and they’re answered, when God’s children call.


Chorus:


There is power in the name of Jesus;
There is hope, there is strength, and victory to claim.
There is healing in His holy presence;
There is power in His name.
