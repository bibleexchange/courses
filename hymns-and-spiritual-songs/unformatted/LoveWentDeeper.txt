Love Went Deeper


Verse 1:
The only way that I love you
Is if I know you love me too
That's how shallow our love becomes
But Calvary's love reached everyone


Verse 2:
No greater wrong could man have done
Than to take the life of my God's own Son
No greater love hath any man
Than to give his life for his friends


Chorus:
Love went deeper
Than the crown of thorns
They placed upon His head
Love went deeper
Than the stripes He bore
When the blood ran crimson red
Love went deeper
Than the hole they dug
When they dropped that old cross in place
Love went deeper than the depths of hell
Deep enough to take my place
