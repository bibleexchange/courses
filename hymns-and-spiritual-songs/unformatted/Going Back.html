What ever happened to death do us part, <br/>Does the home reflect the heart, <br/>Parents faces tell of worried minds, <br/>While children search but can&#39;t seem to find. <br/>It&#39;s time we took a closer look, <br/>Got back to living by the Holy book, <br/>No compromise without getting slack, <br/>You see, we&#39;ll go forward if we&#39;ll just go back. <br/><br/></span><span class="cs4C5E53C7">2</span><span class="cs6A1DE04A">. We&#39;ll know the tree by the fruit we see, <br/>Serving God has no in-between, <br/>we&#39;re either cold or we&#39;re hot, <br/>He said luke warm will have no part. <br/>It&#39;s coming down to in or out, <br/>There&#39;s no time for playing around, <br/>We&#39;re going back to lost or found, <br/>We&#39;re going back to stand our ground. <br/><br/></span><span class="cs4C5E53C7">3.</span><span class="cs6A1DE04A"> Then we&#39;ll rise like a sleeping giant, <br/>Standing tall in God&#39;s strength and might, <br/>The power we&#39;ve claimed for go long, <br/>You see it&#39;s returning, we&#39;re being made strong. <br/>We&#39;re not looking to the right or the left, <br/>Our eyes are spirit lead, <br/>We&#39;re going back to true or false, <br/>Church we&#39;ve got to go back to Calvary&#39;s Cross.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs6A1DE04A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs4C5E53C7">Cho.</span><span class="cs6A1DE04A"> We&#39;ve got to go back to living true, <br/>We&#39;re going back to the absolute, <br/>Back to where the church stood strong, <br/>Back to where there&#39;s a right there is a wrong, <br/>Back to where it&#39;s black or white, <br/>You see the difference is like day and night, <br/>we&#39;re going back to things above, <br/>We&#39;re going back to our first love.</span></p></body>
