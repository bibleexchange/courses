To Get To Jesus


It was comfortable and dry, In the boat that stormy night
When Peter saw the Lord out on the sea
He said Lord you're not that far, Let me come to where you are
And as he stepped out of the boat, He just believed


Maybe you can't see down the road
And where you've been God only knows
And the hope inside your heart
It's almost died


Well friend I have good news
Hope is reaching out to you
You see He's right here in this room
Don't let Him pass you by


Yeah that same voice that raised the dead
When he said: "Lazarus come forth!"
Is calling you, what will you do?
What are you waiting for?


chorus
Whatever it takes to get to Jesus
Just one touch would be enough For all I'm needing
So when I hear Him say come
I'm not gonna walk, I'm gonna run&hellip; Right now
To get to Jesus:
