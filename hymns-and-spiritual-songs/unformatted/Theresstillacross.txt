There's still a cross key-E
Verse 1 
In a time of uncertainty when your backs against the wall
You feel like everything is hopeless and there's no one left to call
There's no rhyme or reason for what's happening to you
You cried out with all that's in you
There's no one to see you through
You begin to think its over, There's nothing else you can do
You've done everything you know is right, But there's no one there for you
When you're all alone and helpless and you know you reached your end
Then some one takes you by the hand and says wait a minute friend
chorus
There's still a cross that stands, There's still a God that saves
No matter how bad things are looking, You gotta know that help is on your way
There's still the savior s blood, there's still his nail scared hands
That can save you from your sin, Make your life whole again
There's still a cross that stand s (2x's)
verse 2
So when the enemy surrounds you , And you feel you've reached your end
Just Let Jesus take you through the fire, He will bring you out again
