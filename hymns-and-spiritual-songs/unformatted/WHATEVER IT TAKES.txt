WHATEVER IT TAKES 
VERSE 1:
There’s a voice calling me from an old rugged tree 
And it whispers, “Draw closer to Me 
Leave your world far behind, There are new heights to climb 
And a new life in Me you will find” 

VERSE 2:
Take the dearest things to me 
If that’s how it must be to draw me closer to You 
Let my disappointments come 
Lonely days without the sun 
If in sorrow more like You I’ll become 

VERSE 3:
I’ll trade sunshine for rain, comfort for pain 
That’s what I’ll be willing to do 
For whatever it takes for my will to break 
That’s what I’ll be willing to do 
That’s what I’ll be willing to do

CHORUS:
For whatever it takes to draw closer to You, Lord 
That’s what I’ll be willing to do 
And whatever it takes to be more like You 
That’s what I’ll be willing to do
