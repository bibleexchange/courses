# Godâ€™s Not Through With You

##VERSE 1

You might be looking failure in the eye. 
You're sure you wanna give up, you've lost the will to try. 
Everything you planned has come apart. 
You're through with starting over, you're running out of heart. 

##CHORUS

God's not through with you. 
He's got a work only you can do. 
Don't fall for Satan's lies, 
God's hand's still on your life. 
Oh no, God's not through with you. 

##VERSE 2

I'm here to say that God believes in you. 
It doesn't matter what you've done, Jesus died for you. 
So, give it all and don't hold back a thing. 
You might be surprised at the good that God can bring.
