We’ve Come this Far By Faith




We've come this far by faith,
leaning on the Lord;
trusting in his holy word.
He's never failed us yet.
Oh! We can't turn back,
we've come this far by faith.


1. Don't be discouraged 
with trouble in your life;
he'll bear your burdens 
and move all discord and strife. Oh!


2. Just remember with good things he has done;
things that seemed impossible,
oh, praise him for the vict'ries he has won. Oh!
