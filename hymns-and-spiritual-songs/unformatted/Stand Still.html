		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Verse 1:<br/>The Father has a plan. Though it&#39;s hard to see it now <br/>You f eel you&#39;re walking all alone. But He is there no doubt <br/>When the storm around you rages, And you&#39;re tossed to and fro <br/>When you&#39;re f aced with life&#39;s decisions, Not sure which way to go <br/><br/>Chorus:<br/>Stand still and let God move, <br/>Standing still is hard to do <br/>When you f eel you have reached the end, <br/>He&#39;ll make a way for you <br/>Stand still and let God move <br/><br/>Verse 2:<br/>When the enemy surrounds you, And the walls are closing in <br/>When the tide is swiftly rising, And you wonder where He&#39;s been <br/>Friend, there never was a moment, That His arms weren&#39;t reaching out <br/>You can rest assured and be secure, God is moving right now <br/><br/>Chorus<br/><br/>When you f eel you have reached the end, He&#39;ll make a way for you <br/>Stand still and let God move <br/>The answer will come, But only in His time <br/><br/>Stand still and let God move, Stand still and let God move</span></p></body>
