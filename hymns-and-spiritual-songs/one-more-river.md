# One More River

## VERSE 1.

	I’ve had a lot of troubles and trials in my little life span

	When I’m standing alone and the battle gets hard, I always do the best I can

	I’ve crossed a million valleys and shed a million tears

	But when I come to the River of Jordan, Hallelujah, then I’ll have no fear (repeat)

## Chorus

	One more river to cross, one more mountain to climb

	One more valley that I’ve gotta go thru then I’m leaving my troubles behind

	One more battle with the devil, then I know he’ll understand

	I’m going thru with Jesus, Hallelujah,

	Holding to His nail scarred hand, holding to His nail scarred hand

## VERSE 2.

	There’s been a lot of people talking ‘bout me since I’ve walked this narrow way

	But that’s just another little valley, I came thru it when I prayed

	I’ve climbed a lot of high mountains and crossed a lot of little streams

	But when I see ol’ Jordan cold and dark, that’ll be the last for me (repeat)
