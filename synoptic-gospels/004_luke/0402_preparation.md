## Preparation

After the genealogy, Luke tells of the preparation of Jesus.

> “Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost...was led by the Spirit into the wilderness”&mdash;Luke 4:1

He was tried and proven. The more you crush a rose, the more it’s fragrance is recognized and released. So the more the devil assaulted Christ, the more His perfection was revealed.

O, to be like Jesus!

Luke is the only one who tells us that Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee (4:14), showing the devil had failed in breaking the fellowship of the Son of man on earth with His Father in Heaven.
