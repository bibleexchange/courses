## Disciples Commissioned (Chapter 9)

### Jesus called them together

### He gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases

### He sent them to preach the kingdom and to heal the sick

### He gave specific instructions (Chapter 10)

“After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also”

“Sent them two by two before His face into every city and place, whither He Himself would come.”

We must go where He says to go, where He will be.
