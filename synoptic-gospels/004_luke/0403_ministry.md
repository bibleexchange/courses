## Ministry

### He went into Galilee (4:14)

His ministry included His home town. He is our example, the perfect man. Our ministry includes our homes.

### Then into Nazareth (4:16)

His mission can be seen in the verses He read in the temple (4:18, 19). He was commissioned, sent of God, and divinely qualified.
