## Mount of Olives (Chapter 22)

He told His disciples to pray and withdrew Himself and prayed.

“Not My will, but will, be done.” Every Christian will face times in his life that he must pray “not my will”

“An angel appeared unto Him from heaven strengthening Him.”

“Being in agony, He prayed more earnestly”

“His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground”

His disciples were sleeping for sorrow.

Soldiers came and Judas betrayed Him with a kiss.
