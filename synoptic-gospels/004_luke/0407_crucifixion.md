## Crucifixion

Only Luke tells of Jesus looking on Peter so that he went out and wept bitterly.

It was the ultimate betrayal to the perfect man.

Only Luke gives the name Calvary, which is the Gentile name for Golgotha.

The superscription is different in each Gospel:

- **Matthew** - "set up over His head His accusation written, 'THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS'" (Matt 27:37). Matthew was showing that Jesus is the Messiah to the end.
- **Mark** - "His accusation was written over, 'THE KING OF THE JEWS'" (Mark 15:26). A servant’s title is brief.
- **Luke** - "Was written over Him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew,... (no accusation) 'THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS'" (Luke 23:38). A perfect man leaves no doubt as to who He is.

Luke omits the verses “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34) because a perfect man has God with Him always.

Only Luke 23:34 records His last prayer, “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do,” because a perfect man forgives.

There are differences in the reactions of the people:

- **Matthew 27:54** records “Truly this was the Son of God” reaching the Jews as the Messiah.
- **Mark 15:39 records** “Truly this man was the Son of God” showing the humanity of our Lord.
- **Luke 23:47** records “Certainly this was a righteous man” seeing His perfection.

Only Luke tells of the road to Emmaus
