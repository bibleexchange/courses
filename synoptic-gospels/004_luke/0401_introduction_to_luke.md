# Luke

## INTRODUCTION TO THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE

### Author

#### Luke is the earthly author of this book

#### Luke gives the greatest amount of information concerning its beginning (1:1-4)

#### This book is addressed to a man named Theophilus (1:3)

The name Theophilus means “Lover of God” or “Loved of God.” He was probably a man of upper class because the title “Most Excellent” was generally applied only to officials or to members of the aristocracy.

#### The author, Luke, is referred to by name three times only

- Col. 4:14
- Philemon 1:24
- II Tim. 4:11

#### We see he is a physician, one of Paul's fellow laborers, and that he was with Paul during his last imprisonment

#### Most feel Luke was a Greek speaking Gentile by birth who had received a good education and who possessed considerable intellectual ability

#### Luke was a medical doctor

#### Luke also wrote the book of Acts (Acts 1:1)

Luke was written before Matthew and Mark. Luke was written probably 1 year before Matthew.

### The audience

#### Luke was written for the Greeks

#### The Greeks were different from the Jews and Romans

- They had a wider culture
- They loved beauty
- They loved rhetoric (the art of using words effectively in speaking or writing)
- They loved philosophy
- They were very concerned with the physical man

#### Luke, as a well educated Greek and doctor, would be well suited for this task

### The Presentation

#### Luke presents Jesus as the ideal or perfect man

Only Luke tells us of:

- When our Lord beheld the city of Jerusalem and wept over it (19:41)
- When He sweat as it were great drops of blood (22:44)
- When He showed mercy to the dying thief on the cross (23:39-43)
- When He led His disciples out as far as Bethany and as He lifted up His hands and blessed them, He was parted from them (24:50)

##### We see Jesus as the perfect man in the introduction

The introduction of the Gospel of John fits the theme of Jesus being the Son of God.

>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”&mdash;John 1:1

Luke, as a simple story touching men, presents Jesus as a man in its introduction (

>“There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zechariah...”&mdash;Luke 1:5

>“And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.”&mdash;Luke 2:1

Note: Micah said that Bethlehem was to be the birthplace of Jesus (Micah 5:2-5).

Mary lived in Nazareth, 100 miles away. Imperial Rome brought forth the decree to compel Mary and Joseph to go to Bethlehem just as the child was born. God named the earthly rulers to do His biding.

We do not find the kings of the East asking for one “who is born a king”.

In the angels message to the watching shepherds, we see “Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior” (2:10-12).

We do NOT see Jesus as a king in Luke.

##### We see the perfect man presented in the genealogy

Matthew had the genealogy of a king. There we find Joseph was begotten by Jacob.

Luke has the genealogy of a perfect man. Here we see Joseph as the son of Heli.

He could not be the son of two men, so it is supposed that Joseph was His son-in-law and Heli was Mary's father.

Matthew started from Abraham and came down to Joseph, but Luke starts from Joseph and goes up to Adam and God. He is traced through Adam because He is the father of all humanity. 

How do we attain to this perfect man? There is only one way, Adam was the son of God, we must become the sons of God.

#### Luke has the most about the humanity of Jesus

- It has the most about Mary
- Only Luke tells of the visit of the shepherds
- Only Luke tells of Jesus’ visit to the temple when He was a youth
- It gives us the fullest account of His birth

#### Luke begins his account a great deal further in the past than the other Synoptic Gospels

We learn about His childhood:

- Jesus developed naturally (2:40,52)
- As a child, He was obedient to Joseph and Mary (2:51)
- No record of unhealthy or supernatural growth

We see Him kneeling in prayer, and that He knew agony and suffering.

Five out of six miracles in the book were miracles of healing.

Only Luke tells of the healing of Malchus’ ear (22:51).

### We can see Luke is also for the outcast on the earth.

Only Luke tells us of:

- The good Samaritan (10:30)
- The publican (18:13)
- The prodigal son (15:11-24)
- Zacchaeus (19:2)

### Luke is the writer that has much to say about womanhood.

In Luke we see the most about Mary and Elisabeth (Chapters 1 and 2).

His regard for women and children are seen in:

- The woman annointed His feet (7:46)
- The woman with the issue of blood and the ruler's daughter (8:42)
- How Jesus delivers the child of a woman (9:38-42)
- Martha and Mary rebuked with compassion (10:38-42)
- Daughters of Jerusalem (23:27, 28)

### The Key Verse is Luke 19:10

“For the son of man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.”

### The Key Word is Compassion

Luke 17:13

#### Jesus (10:33)

#### The Good Samaritan (15:20)

#### The prodigal son’s father
