# Things Jesus Did and Said Questions

We must always remember that He did many more things than those told of Him. For instance in John's gospel we read, "Jesus wept." Nowhere do we read, "Jesus smiled." Yet can you imagine Him surrounded by little children and not smiling at them? He, Who was always talking about joy never smiling? Of course He smiled!
