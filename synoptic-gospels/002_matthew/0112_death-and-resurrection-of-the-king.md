## The Death And Resurrection of The King

This event goes down in the book of history very different than any other crucifixion. In this case, the victim is the one who is the victor. He was the victim in man's eyes, but He was the victor in God's eyes.

The son of Abraham, the sacrifice, dying that all nations of the earth might be blessed by Him.

Jesus was slain being accused as the King of the Jews.

He was raised from the dead because He is King.

Sometimes we are persecuted because of what or who we are. In the end we will be rewarded for the same, if we are faithful (Gal. 6:9).

We see the King's power in the last verses (Matt. 28:18-20)
