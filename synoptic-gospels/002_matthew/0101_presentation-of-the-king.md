## THE PRESENTATION OF THE KING. (1:1-4:11)

### The Coming of the King. - 1:1-2:23.

#### Matthew is the gospel of the Messiah

##### God's anointed one

##### The deliverer

##### The one of whom Moses and the prophets wrote

His goings forth have been&hellip;from everlasting (Micah 5:2).

##### The child that was to be born

##### The son given of whom Isaiah speaks (Isa. 9:6)

#### All maps and calendars of time tell of Christ's birthplace and "birthday."

Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King (Micah 5:2, Matt. 2:1).

The Gospel does not begin with "once upon a time," but it begins with "Bethlehem of Judah."

The time is definite. History knows Herod. 

Matthew sets this record in the solid foundation of history. We are not building our faith on a myth. This was not done in a corner, but in the broad day, and it is not afraid of the geographers map or the historian's pen.

#### The story of the birth of Jesus

In Luke, Jesus' earthly life began in a stable. His cradle was a manger. His family and associates were humble people. He came as a helpless babe. It showed how human our Lord was.

In Matthew Jesus was heralded by an archangel, welcomed by an angel choir, and worshipped by earth's wisest philosophers. It shows how divine our Lord was.

The "Begats" and "Sons of" are for a purpose.

Matthew gives His genealogy from Abraham and David. It shows Him as a Jew. He has royal decent. He is the King, the Messiah, and the Promised Ruler of Israel.

Luke gives His genealogy backwards to Adam. It shows Him as a man. He was of the race of human lineage, the ideal man, and born of woman. Luke contains the most about Mary.

He descended from a royal family, As king He claims rulership in our lives. As a man, he knows our sorrows and is aquatinted with our grief.

### The Kingly Line

#### Twelve ways He is like a King in Matthew

1. A king's name&mdash;"They shall call His name Emmanuel"
 (1:23)
2. A king's position&mdash;"Out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel." (2:6)
3. A king's announcement&mdash;"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight." (3:3)
4. A king's coronation&mdash;"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." (3:17)
5. A king's due respect&mdash;"Thou shalt worship the Lord God, and Him only shalt thou serve." (4:10)
6. A king's proclamation&mdash;"And He opened His mouth and taught them" (5:2)
7. A king's loyalty&mdash;"He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad." (12:30)
8. A king's enemies&mdash;"From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes." (16:21)
9. A king's love&mdash;"The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. (20:28)
10. A king's glory&mdash;"When the Son of man shall come&hellip;then shall the King say unto them&hellip;Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom." (27:31, 34)
11. A king's sacrifice&mdash;"And they crucified Him&hellip;and set up over His head, this accusation written, This is Jesus, king of the Jews." (27:35, 37)
12. A king's victory&mdash;"He is not here; for he is risen, as He said." (28:6)

### Wise Men Still Seek Him

#### Only Matthew tells of the visit of the wise men from the east.

They came inquiring "Where is he that is born King of the Jews." Mark, Luke and John are silent about the wise men. They are not recording the birth of a King.

Herod did not want to worship (2:8).

The wise men looked up. They did not look to maps or man. No man can come except the Spirit draw him (2:9).

They saw, humbled themselves, worshipped, and gave of themselves (2:11).

The first time the word "God" is used in the book of Matthew is in 2:12. The wise men realized this was not just another man, but that this was God. They met Jesus Christ. We are not to serve the old master or ruler, but Jesus became their King (2:12).

They left different. They departed another way.

### The forerunner of the King (3:1-12)

The King must be announced.

John the Baptist was the voice (Isa. 40:3, Matt. 3:2, 3).

John the Baptist was the forerunner of Christ. There are forerunners yet to come still, with the same power and anointing as Elijah, or John the Baptist. 

John the Baptist's ministry was a short ministry (Luke 3:13).

It was the duty of the herald to go before the king. As a Roman officer before his ruler they commanded that the roads be repaired over which his master would travel.

We see the King stepping forth from His private and personal life to public ministry.

### The baptism of Jesus (3:13-17)

"This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."

### The temptation of Jesus (4:1-11)

Jesus was led of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, and Christ said "it is written," and the devil had to leave.

He went through trial as a King. Satan offered a "short-cut" to the end. Only by obeying God's way will we really gain the goal. Eve was offered her a short-cut to "be like God," and she took it. Where did it lead her? (I Cor. 10:13)
