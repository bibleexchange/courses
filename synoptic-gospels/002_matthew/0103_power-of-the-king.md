## THE POWER OF THE KING. (8:1-11:1)

### Demonstration of the King's power (8:1- 9:34)

Great multitudes followed Him.

#### He healed a leper (8:2-4)

#### He healed a centurion's servant (8:5-13)
 
The centurion was a man of great faith.

#### He healed Peter's mother-in-law (8:14-15)

#### He healed many (8:16-17)

##### He cast out the spirits with His Word

##### He healed all that were sick

#### He stilled the storm (8:18-27)

The disciples did not believe.

The winds and sea obeyed Jesus.

#### He healed the demoniacs of Gadara (8:28-34)

#### He healed the palsied man (9:1-8)

#### He called Matthew (9:9)

#### He came to call sinners to repentance (9:10-13)

#### He was questioned by John's disciples (9:14-15)

#### He gave parables of the new and the old (9:16-17)

#### He raised Jarius' daughter (9:18-19, 23-26)

#### He healed the woman that touched His garment (9:20-22)

#### He healed two blind men (9:27-31)

#### He healed the mute demoniacs (9:32-34)

### Delegation of the King's power (9:35-11:1)

#### He commanded His disciples to pray for laborers (9:35-38)

Jesus was ministering in Galilee, and He was moved with compassion for the people. He told the disciples to pray because many laborers were needed.

His power is worked through open vessels (those yielded to Him). He wants us to be laborers. He is looking for those who will move in the Spirit.

#### He sent forth the Twelve (10:1-11:1)
 
He was organizing His kingdom. A King must have subjects. The twelve disciples were the King's Cabinet.

He wants to reflect His light through human instruments and vessels. We are the light of the world, but He is the source of that light. Jesus still has a great love for the world, but He still needs man to carry it. Spiritual ideas cannot walk alone throughout the world and be of any value. They must be clothed with humility. We must serve as hearts, brains, hands, and feet to carry the Gospel.

> Romans 10:14-15 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

##### He sent them with power (10:1)

##### He sent ordinary men (10:2-4)

Where did Jesus find the first members of His cabinet? Not in the temple, among doctors or priests, or in the colleges of Jerusalem, but He found them on the sea shore mending their nets.

The disciples had to come to the place that they realized they were sinners. People who think they are well are self-righteous.
 
God calls the foolish to confound the wise (I Cor. 1:27).

Matthew 10:2-4 is one of the most important lists of "Who's Who" in the world.

These men were given a work to do that would make winning battles and founding empires seem of small consequence.

##### He sent them to Israel (10:5-6)

##### He sent them with a mission (10:7-10)

###### Preach the kingdom of Heaven is at hand

The word "kingdom" is used 55 times in Matthew, and the phrase "Kingdom of Heaven" occurs 35 times. Of fifteen parables in Matthew, twelve start with "the kingdom of heaven is like..."

###### Heal the sick

###### Cleanse the leper

###### Raise the dead

###### Cast out devils

###### Freely ye have received, freely give
