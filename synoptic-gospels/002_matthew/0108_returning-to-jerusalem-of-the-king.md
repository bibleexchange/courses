## RETURNING TO JERUSALEM OF THE KING (20:17-21:46)

### Crucifixion again foretold (20:17-19)

### A mother's request (20:20-24)

### Christ the ministering servant (20:25-28)

#### We are to follow Christ's example

#### Gave His life a ransom for many

### Two blind men healed (20:29-34)

### The Triumphal Entry (21:1-11)

The two disciples brought an ass and a colt.

This parade could not have been compared in magnificence to any procession that has attended the coronation of a king, or the inauguration of a president; but it meant much more for the world. 

This was the first public recognition of His rights Messiah and King. He offered Himself as Messiah only to be
rejected and killed. How great is the love of God!

The people spread garments and branches to carpet the highway. They cried our Psalms and when people asked them who He was they replied, "This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee."

After the crowd has dispersed, some may have thought that nothing was accomplished in making Him King. His hour had not yet come. Christ must be Savior first and then come as King of kings and Lord of lords.

### Chief priests and scribes displeased (21:15-17)

### Fig tree cursed (21:18-22)

### Opposers silenced (21:23-27)

### Parable of the two sons (21:28-32)

### Parable of the vineyard (21:33-46)

We see Christ came unto His own, and His own received Him not. There's a difference in being rejected by an enemy or being rejected by a friend. It's even more severe when it is someone you love or family.

The Kingdom was offered first to the rightful heirs, the children of Israel, the Jews. They refused the offer, rejected the King, and finally crucified Him.

Jesus announced that the Kingdom shall be taken away from the Jews and given to another nation (21:43).

The announcement offended the rulers and they sought to kill Him (21:46).
