### The Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:29)

Every kingdom must have it's laws and standards to control it's subjects. This is the "constitution" of the Kingdom. Jesus declared He came not to destroy the law but to fulfill it.

Reform that starts on the outside and works in is beginning at the wrong end. Christ starts on the inside and works out. The only way of getting a good life is getting a good heart.

On the mountain top most people are concerned with the blessings of God. Jesus was concerned with the law that brought righteous living, which would then bring the blessing.

The root of this law is kindness. Love reigns instead of lawlessness.

We are shown that sin lies not in just committing the act but in the motive (Matt. 5:21, 22, 27, 28).

Fourteen times the King says, "I say unto you."

This law brings us:

* love instead of lawlessness
* truth instead of treachery
* gladness instead of grief
* justice instead of injustice
* divinity instead of division
* righteousness instead of wrath

The central theme is perfection (5:48).
