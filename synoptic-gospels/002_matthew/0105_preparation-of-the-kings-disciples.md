## THE PREPARATION OF THE KINGS DISCIPLES (16:13-17:13)

### Peter's revelation of Christ (16:13-17:13)

One of life's most important questions is "Who do men say that I, the Son of man, am?" (Matt. 16:13).

Who is he to you personally? Savior? Healer? Deliverer?

Peter answered, "Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God."

This was revealed to him by the Father.

### The keys of the Kingdom (16:18-19)

Peter (Cephas) was a small stone, but Jesus is the Rock. Peter is not the rock, Catholics will claim this scripture, But Peter is a small stone, Cephas meaning a small stone, but Jesus was the rock (I Corinthians 3:10, 11; I Peter 2:6).

Keys represent authority.

Peter even though he received the revelation he didn't understand completely.

### Christ's death forthtold (16:20-28)

Peter had a lack of understanding, and was rebuked by Jesus.

Jesus told the disciples that they needed to take up the cross.
