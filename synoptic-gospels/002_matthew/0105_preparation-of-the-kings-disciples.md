from MKB notes:

Matthew 16:12 &mdash; talking about the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees
16:13 
Peter&apos;s revelation of Christ, 
Peter is not the rock, Catholics will claim this scripture, But Peter is a small stone, Cephas meaning a small stone, but Jesus was the rock
I Corinthians 3:10, 11
I Peter 2:6
vs. 19
Keys represent authority; 
Peter even though he received the revelation he didn&apos;t understand completely 
16:28 &mdash; Who might that be referring to? John the beloved
It is commonly believed that John did not see death but was like Enoch was
 
Matthew 17: 
Moses could not enter into the Promised Land, because of unbelief; where is Moses now, he is standing on the Promised Land. 
We believe that the Jesus Only doctrine is a false doctrine. 
17:8 &mdash; this one of the scriptures that they use to base their doctrine on
Jesus believes that there is only one God, ÃŠ
Manifested as the Father in creation, The Son in regeneration, The Holy Ghost in sanctification 
Basically people fall into error when they take one scripture by itself, like the boy who looked through at the parade through the knothole, he didn&apos;t see the parade
How do they explain the interaction between the father and the son, they somehow believe he separated from himself &mdash; this is not an exact quote, not creditable enough to base on
There is a world of false doctrine out there. 
 
There is a need in the ministry for &quot;Prayer and Fasting&quot; 
Is it easy &mdash; no, Does the flesh enjoy it &mdash; no, Is it necessary - yes
 
Will we preach the truth in the face of going to jail? 
 
Matthew 18:
 
Romans 6:
Get rid of that which causes you to stumble. 
 
There is power in agreement,
