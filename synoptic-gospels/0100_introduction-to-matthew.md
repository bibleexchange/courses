## INTRODUCTION TO THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW

### Description of this Book

Matthew links the Old and New Testament. In the Old Testament we find Two great covenants:

1. Covenant with David - II Sam. 7:8-13,16 (A KING)
2. Covenant with Abraham - Gen. 22:8 (A SACRIFICE)

Matthew opens with the birth of a king, and closes with the offering of a  sacrifice.

In the book of Matthew we find The King&#8217;s&hellip;

- Geneology (From Abraham to Josep)
- Birthplace (Bethlehem)
- Forerunner (John the Baptist)
- Ministry
- Rejection by Israel
- Promise of Coming Again in Power and Glory

Matthew was wise in not alienating the Jews. He showed them that this Jesus fulfilled every prophecy spoken concerning their Messiah. Matthew uses over 25 quotes from  the Old Testament. Many times he talks about "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet". 16 times Matthew uses the word &#8220;fulfilled&#8221;.

A Jew tends to feel that he must give up his tradition and orthodox and accept another creed.  Matthew in this book and Paul in Galatians, show the Jewish Christians that they were not giving up their old faith, but rather were only giving up types and shadows for the real substance.

Matthew is the book of fulfillment.

Matthew used his knowledge of Jewish history and customs. He speaks of farming, fishing, and the housekeeping of his people to touch their hearts.

Matthew presents our Lord in a distinctly Jewish relationship.

Only in Matthew do we find a record of the Messiah saying "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of Israel".  Matt. 15:24

What did his own people do with Him? John 1:11

###  Author of this Book

The Apostle Matthew is the author of this book. The name "Matthew" means "gift of God". The Disciple Matthew had been a tax collector before Jesus called him. This disciple was also known by the name "Levi". Matthew calls himself a publican which was a reproach (perhaps something like calling someone a politician today).

Other evangelists tell about the great feast he gave Jesus.  They also record the significant fact that he left all and followed Jesus.  No doubt he was a man of means.

### Position of This Book

#### Breaks the 400 Years of silence between Malachi&#8217;s prophecy and the announcement of the birth of Jesus.

1. Israel was under the domination of the Roman Empire.
2. No man of the house of David had been allowed to sit upon the throne for over 600 years.

#### Matthew follows after the Old Testament and is the beginning of the New Testament.

1. It is the connecting link between the old covenant and the new covenant.
2. It is written for the Jew.
3. The Old Testament closed with the chosen nation looking for their long-promised king (their Messiah).
4. The New Testament begins with the appearance of this king.

#### Numerically

1. Matthew is the 40th book of the Bible. (39 books in the OT before Matthew.)
3. The number 40 means testing or probation
4. Jesus fasted 40 days and then was tempted of the devil
5. Israel was in the wilderness 40 years
6. Moses was in a palace for 40 years and then on the backside of the desert 40 years
7. In this 40th book, Israel is in the place of testing.

To the Jews a stumbling block I Cor. 1:23
Christ is presented as King to the Jews and they reject Him not only as their Messiah, but as their Savior.  Matt. 16:21
