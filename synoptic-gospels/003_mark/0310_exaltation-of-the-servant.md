# Exaltation of the Servant

## Resurrection from the Dead

After the servant had given His life a ransom for all, He arose from the dead.

## Great Commission to His Disciples

Read and compare the great commission as found in Mark 16:15-18 and Matt. 28:19-20

> Mark 16:15-18&mdash;And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. 17  And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 18  They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.

> Matthew 28:19-20&mdash;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20  Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. 

### We are Laborers with Him

> I Corinthians 3:9&mdash;For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

### We Must labor always

> I Corinthians 15:58&mdash;Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. 

## Ascension to Heaven

> Philippians 2:7-9&mdash;But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 8  And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 9  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:

Jesus was once in the form of a servant, then highly exalted. He who had taken upon Him the form of a servant was received in Heaven to sit on the right hand of God.
