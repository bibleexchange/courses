# Forgiving of Sins by the Servant

## Mark 1:40

Cleansed the leper

> Mark 1:40&mdash;And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 

## Mark 2:1

News spread, even without the newspapers or radios.

> Mark 2:1&mdash;And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house. 

## Mark 2:3,4

> Mark 2:3,4&mdash; And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. 4  And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. 

They brought him who was sick of the palsy. Sometimes we need others to help  bring us to  Jesus.

These friends knew where Jesus was. Choose your friends wisely.

> Proverbs 14:7&mdash;Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.

## Mark 2:7

> Mark 2:7&mdash;Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?

- Jesus is not only the healer of the body but the healer of the soul.

- Only God can forgive sin.
