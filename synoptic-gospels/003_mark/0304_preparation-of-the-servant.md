## Preparation of the Servant

### The Servant Prepared

#### Jesus

##### Prepared thirty years before entered into public ministry.

#### Life

##### The plant sends it’s roots into the soil before it brings forth the flower and leaf for all to see.

#### Moses

##### Fourty years in the desert before he entered into his great work.

#### David

##### Thirty years old when made king.

#### John the Baptist

##### Thirty years before entered into ministry.

#### Getting ready for our life’s work is of tremendous importance. Sometimes God uses much time in preparing us.

### Preparation by John the Forerunner

#### Mark begins with John the Baptist making ready for the coming of the Messiah.

#####  John’s coming was in fulfillment of a Messianic prophesy 1:2

###### Malachi 3:1   Isaiah 40:3

#### God does not always choose the kind of men we would select.

##### John the Baptist

###### Clothed with camel's hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins.

###### His food locusts and wild honey.

##### God often picks the foolish things to confound the wise and the weak things to confound the things that are mighty.

###### I Cor. 1:27-29

#### No doubt some would have chosen the herald for Christ as one of high birth, university trained, a man of wide reputation, eloquent and a success.

Not so with God!

##### John was of humble birth, little known, did not graduate from an accredited college, and was dressed like a desert hermit.

#### But, as they went before kings to repair the roads so John went before The King to prepare the hearts. His messag was startling as his appearance.

##### “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.”

##### A true revival is always a revival of righteousness.

### Preparation by Baptism

#### John hesitated to baptise Jesus.

##### Matt. 3:14  “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?”

#### Jesus was baptized with John’s baptism in obedience to an appointed ordinance.

##### Matt. 3:15  “Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.”

##### Christ was the example of righteousness.

### Preparation By The Holy Spirit

#### Mark 1:10

##### In any service for God, we need the Holy Ghost to prepare and give us power.

#### Acts 10:38

##### God appointed Jesus of Nazareth

### Preparation By A Divine Call

#### Mark 1:11

##### “There came a voice from heaven.”

#### Mark 9:7

##### “This is my Beloved Son, hear him.”

### Preparation By Testing

#### Mark 1:12

##### “And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.”

###### Driveth = servant Mark 1:12

###### Led up = king Matt. 4:1

##### Out of the experience of the baptism comes the test.

##### It was a divine appointment, not an accident or evil fate. We would never develop without the trial.

##### James 1:12

###### “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love Him.”

#### We do not need to run into temptation of our own accord.  

##### Jesus was led or driven by the spirit.

#### We must walk the path that is set before us.  If it is through a trial, we must pray “thy will be done”.

#### I Cor. 10:13

##### “But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able...”
