# Rejection of the Servant

#### Even before Mark sets forth Christâ€™s claim to be King of the Kingdom, he reveals the way the servant is to be received.

#### Jesus tells His disciples He is to be rejected by the elders, chief priests and scribes.  Mark 8:31

##### He is to be delivered by treachery

Mark 9:31

##### He is to be put to death by the Romans

Mark 10:32-45

##### He is to rise again the third day

Mark 9:31

#### It is said Jesus was sold for thirty pieces of silver - the price of a slave.

#### He was executed as only slaves were.

#### No reference was made in Mark that in the garden He had the right to summon twelve legions of angels, if He so willed.

#### No promise of the kingdom is given to the dying thief on the cross.

##### These things were said by the King in Matthew but not by the servant in Mark.
