Mark
====

## The Author

### Mark

#### There is no reference to its author, but most agree it was John Mark.  

##### John is his Jewish or Hebrew name.

##### Mark is his Roman or Latin name.

##### He was the son of Mary and the cousin of Barnabas.  

Mary was a woman of money because she supposedly owned her home and kept slaves.

#### Mark was converted by Peter who called him &quot;my son&quot; in I Peter 5:13

#### Mark accompanied Paul and Barnabas to Antioch.  

##### Some feel some trouble here because Mark left  

(Acts 12:25, 13:5)but it was resolved because he was later with Paul at Rome (Col. 4:10)  and Paul during his last Roman imprisonment, asks Timothy to come to him and to bring Mark also (II Tim. 4:11)

#### Mark was probably written around 50 AD

## The Purpose

### We can see the purpose of the book in the key verse.

#### Mark 10:45

### Mark presents a servant.

## The People

### Mark is writing to the Romans.

#### Unlike Matthew, Mark was not trying to prove certain statements and prophecies concerning Jesus the Messiah.

#### The Romans were more concerned with deeds than words so Markâ€™s gospel is full of action.

#### The Romans were people of action rather than thought.

#### Mark presents Christ as the mighty worker rather than a profound thinker.

#### He presents Jesus as the man who conquers by doing.

#### So we have the vivid and rapid record, with little discourse and much movement and accomplishment.

### Characteristics of a Roman

The Roman was different than the Jew.

- His strong point was his strong common sense.

- His religion must be practiced.

- He would have no interest in tracing beliefs back into the past.

- Legal geaneologies and fulfillment of prophecies would leave him cold and hard hearted.

- One writer said a Roman might say, &quot;I know nothing of your scriptures, and care nothing for your peculiar notions; but I would be glad to hear a plain story of the life this man Jesus lived. Tell me what He did.  Let me see Him just as He was.&quot;
