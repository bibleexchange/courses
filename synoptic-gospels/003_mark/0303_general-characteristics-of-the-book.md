## General Characteristics of the Book

### It has been said the skill of an artist may lie in what he leaves out.

An amateur crowds everything in. We can see this with Mark.

#### There is nothing about the virgin birth. 

No reference to His birth is made in the whole Gospel.

### No one is interested in the pedigree of a servant.

#### There is no visit of the wise men.

### A servant does not receive homage.

#### There is no account of the boy Jesus in the temple.

##### servants are not important as children.

#### There is no Sermon on the Mount.

##### A servant has no kingdom and frames no laws.

#### There are no continual quotations from the prophets. Only one in 1:2. Matthew quotes on every page.

#### No divine titles are used. Jesus is never called “King” except in derision.  Matthew says, “They shall call His name ‘Emanuel’“ (God with us).

##### Mark calls Him Master where others call Him Lord.

###### Matthew - “Lord, save us; we perish”

###### Mark - “Master, carest thou not that we perish?”

#### There is no statement that His work is finished at death. In John 19:30 He said, “It is finished.”

##### A servant does not say when his work is done.

##### A servant has no introduction.

##### Twenty miracles are given in Mark in detail.

### Jesus is portrayed as the humble but perfect servant of Jehovah and we find angels ministering unto Him.
