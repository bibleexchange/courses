1. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ fits his theme -

a. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” John 1:1

19 Go ye therefore, and teach \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

B. Mark 15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 

16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.

17 And these \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.

19 So then after the \_\_\_\_\_had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

C. Luke

48 And ye are witnesses of these things.

49 And, behold, I send the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of my Father upon
