PARABLE OF NEW LOTH AND OLD GARMENTS
MATTHEW 9:16, MARK 2:21, LUKE 5:36

The Lord added two illustrations to announce the arrival of a new era, one which was incompatible with the previous era. The first involved a new patch made of cloth that has not been shrunk. If used to repair an old garment. The garment made of older cloth, will be weaker. Jesus was comparing the old dispensation to the old garment. God never intended Christianity to patch up Judaism.
A Judeo-Christian which, with the profession of Grace and the Gospel to keep the law and fosters legal righteousness, is a greater abomination in the eyes of God, than a professing Israel in the past, worshipping idols.
