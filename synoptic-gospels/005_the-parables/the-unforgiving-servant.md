PARABLE OF THE UNFORGIVING SERVANT

Mat 18:21  Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? 
Mat 18:22  Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. 
Mat 18:23  Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. 
Mat 18:24  And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. 
Mat 18:25  But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. 
Mat 18:26  The servant therefore fell down, and worshiped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 
Mat 18:27  Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. 
Mat 18:28  But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, which owed him a hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. 
Mat 18:29  And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 
Mat 18:30  And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. 
Mat 18:31  So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. 
Mat 18:32  Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: 
Mat 18:33  Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee? 
Mat 18:34  And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. 
Mat 18:35  So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
 
A parable to warn against the consequences of an unforgiving  spirit, who has been freely forgiven.
The application is clear. God is the King. All His servants had contracted a great debt of sin which they were unable to pay. In His wonderful grace, the Lord paid the debt, and granted full forgiveness.
We have much to be forgiven for. Our debts are GREAT. Who are we that we cannot forgive our brethren?
