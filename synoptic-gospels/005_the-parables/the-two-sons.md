PARABLE OF THE TWO SONS
MATTHEW 21:28-32

Mat 21:28 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard. 
Mat 21:29 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. 
Mat 21:30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. 
Mat 21:31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. 
Mat 21:32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. 
 This parable is a stinging rebuke to the chief priests and elders for their failure to obey John&apos;s call to repentance and faith.
It concerns a man whose two sons were asked to work in the vineyard. One refused, then changed his mind and went. He other agreed to go, but never did.
Tax collectors and harlots were like the first son. The religious leaders were like the second son. They professed to approve the preaching of John, but never confessed their sins, or trusted the Savior. Avowed sinners receive the gospel more readily than those with a veneer or false piety.
