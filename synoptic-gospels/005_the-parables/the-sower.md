THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER
How men receive the Word Of God.
Mar 4:1 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. 
Mar 4:2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, 
Mar 4:3 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: 
Mar 4:4 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 
Mar 4:5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: 
Mar 4:6 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 
Mar 4:7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 
Mar 4:8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred. 
Mar 4:9 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
Mar 4:10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. 
Mar 4:11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: 
Mar 4:12 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. 
Mar 4:13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? 
Mar 4:14 The sower soweth the word. 
Mar 4:15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. 
Mar 4:16 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; 
Mar 4:17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. 
Mar 4:18 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 
Mar 4:19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 
Mar 4:20 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.
