The King Going to War                                                                                            Lu 14:31 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?                                                                                                                  32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.                                                                                                                33 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.                                                                                                                                           Pr 20:18 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.                           1Ti 1:18 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which     went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;                                                 2Ti 2:3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

Forsaking All
Come with a full purpose to always be a True Christian;  mean to persevere, by the grace of God, through all hazards, and trials, and temptations;  willing to bear his cross, and meet contempt, rejection, misunderstanding and poverty, and pain, and death.
