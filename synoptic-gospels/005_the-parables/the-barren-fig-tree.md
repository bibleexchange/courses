The Barren Fig Tree       
Lu 13:6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.                                                                                            7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?                                      8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:                                                                                                                                                                  9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.
I. “A Certain Man”  -  God is being represented
II. “had a fig tree planted in his vineyard”  -   The Fig tree should be fruitful
III. “he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none”  
God’s Judgment was pronounced on the fig tree, Cut it down
God’s Wisdom was performed, why cumbereth it the ground?
God’s mercy was shown, “let it alone this year also”                                      
God is looking for fruit to His Honor and to His Glory.
Fruit is the Manifestation of the Life of Jesus from your heart.
Am I bearing fruit?
Am I bearing fruit unto God’s Glory?
Isa. 4:2 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
Lu 13:3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.                                                     Lu 13:5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
Mt 3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:                                                                                        10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.                                                            
Jas 3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.  18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
Heb 12:11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
2Pe 3:9  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
