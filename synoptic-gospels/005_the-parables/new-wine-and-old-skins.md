SYNOPTIC GOSPELS
PARABLE OF THE NEW WINE INTO OLD WINESKINS
MATTHEW 9:17, MARK 2:22, LUKE5:37-39

	This parable like the previous parable mentioned, speaks of the mixture before would be like putting new wine into old wine skins. The pressure caused by fermentation of the new would burst the old wine skins, because they had lost their elasticity.
	The introduction of the Christian era would invariably result in tension. The joy which Christ produces could not be contained within the forms and rituals of the Old Testament.
