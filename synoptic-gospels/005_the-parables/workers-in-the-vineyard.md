PARABLES OF THE WORKERS IN THE VINEYARD

Mat 20:1  For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. 
Mat 20:2  And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 
Mat 20:3  And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, 
Mat 20:4  And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. 
Mat 20:5  Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. 
Mat 20:6  And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? 
Mat 20:7  They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. 
Mat 20:8  So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. 
Mat 20:9  And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. 
Mat 20:10  But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. 
Mat 20:11  And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, 
Mat 20:12  Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. 
Mat 20:13  But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? 
Mat 20:14  Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. 
Mat 20:15  Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? 
Mat 20:16  So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.

In this parable, the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who is a householder. He needed laborers to work his field. He went out and hired them for the daily wage.
He hired men in the third hour, and also hired in the sixth and ninth hour, and in the eleventh hour. He paid all his workers the same wage.
The farmer knew that all these men needed money, so he paid them according to need, rather than greed.
There will be surprises in the matter of rewards. Some who thought they would be first will be last because their service was inspired by pride and selfish ambition. Others who served out of love and gratitude will be highly honored.

Deeds of merit as we thought them, 
He will show us were but sin,
Little acts we have forgotten
He will show us were for Him. 6(anon)
