Through Christ, by the Spirit, In Christ
in the place of acceptance

He laid down his life for the sheep
He took back his life

The Man that Jesus healed and that the Pharisees excommunicated him is the background of this Parable. (Jn.9)

3. Thieves have stolen away the sheep.

Isa 53:6-12 
&hellip; have turned every one to his own way&hellip;
&hellip;He was taken from prison and from judgment&hellip;
 9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. 
 10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. 
 11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.
 12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

John 10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.

John 10:8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
