The Rich Fool-Luke 12:13-21
Lu 12:13  And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
The Man of Wealth should have more Fear of God and concern for the things of God.
Lu 12:15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.                                                       
The man of wealth has become a fool.                                     
Lu 12:20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?                                                                   21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
A double warning is given.   
                  “ Take heed, and beware”
Covetousness
Self-centeredness                                                                                                                                    "I" six times and "my" five times. The man's attention was solely upon himself.
Selfishness
a.    He thought only of himself, living at ease and in comfort, of indulging self and being extravagant. He gave no thought to helping others. He willfully forgot that he lived in a needy world that was lost and dying.
b.    He put off living and enjoying life until he got his barns built. He will be consumed with this passion until he has what he wants. 
c.    Now He only thought these things. He never did them; they were only thoughts of his heart.
Lu 12:17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?                                                                                                                    Col 3:5 ¶ Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:                                                                                                                                                                           Ps 119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.                                                Mr 7:21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,                                                                                                                                              22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:                                                                                                                                  23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
