PARABLE OF THE TALENTS
MATTHEW 25:14-30

Mat 25:14  For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. 
Mat 25:15  And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. 
Mat 25:16  Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. 
Mat 25:17  And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. 
Mat 25:18  But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. 
Mat 25:19  After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. 
Mat 25:20  And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. 
Mat 25:21  His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
Mat 25:22  He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. 
Mat 25:23  His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
Mat 25:24  Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed: 
Mat 25:25  And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. 
Mat 25:26  His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed: 
Mat 25:27  Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. 
Mat 25:28  Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. 
Mat 25:29  For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. 
Mat 25:30  And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
This parable revolves around a man who,before going on a long journey, assembles his own servants and gave to each varying amounts of money. One gets 5 talents, another 2, and the last gets one talent. They were to use this money to bring income to the master. The man with the 5 talents earned another 5. The man with 2, doubled also. But the man with the one talent went and dug a hole and buried it.
Christ is the master. The three servants are Israelites living during the tribulation, responsible to represent the interests of the absent Lord. They are given responsibility according to their individual abilities.
After along time, the Lord returns, and settles account with them. The 1st two received exactly the same acommadation, “well done, good and faithful servant: you were faithful over a few things, enter into the joy of the Lord” The test of their service was not how much they earned, but how hard they tried. Each used his ability fully and earned 100%! These represent believers. 
The 3rd servant had nothing but insults and excuses for his master. He accused him of being hard and unreasonable. He excused himself on the basis that he was afraid, so he buried his talent. The servant is an unbeliever, no reak servant would think that of his master.
If this man had earned one talent with his talent, he would have received the same commendation. Instead, all he had to show for his life was a hole in the ground! His talent was given to the man with the ten talents. “To everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.”
Those who desire to be used for God’s glory are given the means. The more they do, the more they are enabled to do for Him. We lose what we do not use.
The mention of the bankers in vs27, suggests that if we cannot use our possessions for the Lord, we should turn them over to others who can. The bankers in this case may be missionaries, Bible Societies etc. There is no excuse for leaving money idle.
The unprofitable servant was cast out. He shared his fate with the wicked. It was not his failure to invest the talent, that condemned him, rather his lack of good works showed that he lacked saving faith.
