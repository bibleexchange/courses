PARABLE OF THE WEDDING FEAST

Mat 22:1  And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
Mat 22:2  The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son.
Mat 22:3  And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
Mat 22:4  Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.
Mat 22:5  But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
Mat 22:6  And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.
Mat 22:7  But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
Mat 22:8  Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
Mat 22:9  Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
Mat 22:10  So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
Mat 22:11  And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
Mat 22:12  And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
Mat 22:13  Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Mat 22:14  For many are called, but few are chosen.

In this parable, Jesus is again picturing favored Israel, as set aside and despised Gentiles as guests at the table.
He likens the kingdom of Heaven to a certain king who arranged a marriage feast for his son. The  invitation was in two stages. First, an advance invitation personally conveyed by servants, which met a flat refusal. The second invitation announced the feast was spread. It was treated contemptuously by some, stating they were too busy with their farms, etc, and violently by others, who seized, abused, and killed the servants.
The first stage of the invitation pictures John the Baptist and the twelve disciples graciously inviting Israel to the wedding feast, but the nation refused to accept the invitation. The words “they were not willing to come” (v3),
Were dramatized in the crucifixion.
The second stage of the invitation suggests the proclamation of the gospel to the Jews in the book of Acts. Some treated it with contempt. Some treated the messengers violently, most of the apostles were martyred.
The King, sent “His armies” in the sense that he uses them as His instruments to punish Israel. They were His officially, even if they did not know Him personally.
The Gospel goes out to the Gentiles, both bad and good, that is, all degrees of respectability.
Act 13:45  But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
Act 13:46  Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
Act 28:28  Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.
But the reality of each individual who comes is tested. The man without a wedding garment on is one who professes to be ready for the kingdom, but who has never been clothed in righteousness of God through the Lord Jesus Christ.
2Co 5:21  For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
There was, and is, no excuse for the man with the wedding garment. As Ryrie notes, it was the custom to provide garment for the guests if they had none. The man did not take advantage of this! Without Christ he is speechless when challenged as to his right to enter into the kingdom.
Rom 3:19  Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
(v14) refers to the whole parable and not just to the incident of the man without the wedding garment. Many are called, that is, the gospel invitation goes out to many, yet few are chosen, some refuse the invitation, some who respond favorably are exposed as false professors. As Jennings states it, “all are called to enjoy the feast, but not all are willing to trust the Giver to provide the robe that is fit for the feast”
