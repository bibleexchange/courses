# The Two Creditors
Lu 7:36 -50

Like Nathan with David, (II Sam. 12:1-12) our Lord reveals His main point in a parable, and makes the home owner reason in the course of his case.

The two debtors are the woman and Simon; the crime of the one was ten times that of the other (in the proportion of "five hundred" to "fifty"); but both being sinners, both can be forgiven; and Simon is made to know that the greatest debtor to forgiving mercy will cling to her Divine Benefactor with the deepest thanks.

He that is forgiven little loves little.

Jesus is worthy of the Sacrifice of Praise, the Greatest Respect, the Highest Worship

- Not just the common decency to (wash His feet with water as a servant to a visitor) but she washed His feet with her tears and wiped them with her own hair.

- Not just the common greeting (a kiss on the cheek- respectfully- cheek to cheek)
But she ceased not kissing his feet with her lips with the upmost humility and the lowest brokenness.

- Not just the oil of the usual, the common anointing but the ointment of great price
An alabaster box poured out on His feet.
Not just the common decency to stand behind Him but to stand behind Him at His feet weeping

- The woman was thinking about who Jesus is and believing in Him, Simon was thinking about who and what she was, while questioning Him as a prophet.

## The woman's sins were many. Jesus did not overlook her many sins, nor the seriousness of them.

##  Self-righteousness sensed the need for little forgiveness; therefore, the self-righteous loved little. The self-righteous had only a formal, distant relationship with God. His relationship was cold, having only a small sense of sin and sensing only a little need for forgiveness. It was enough to have Jesus present at his table but the woman welcomed Him into her heart.

## The woman believed Christ to be the Savior, the One who could forgive her sins. Therefore, Christ saved her.
The Attitude of the Self-righteous.

 1.    The man was considerate, but self-righteous. He only thought these things; he would not say them publicly lest he embarrass his guests. 

2.    The man considered himself better. He felt he was better than the sinful woman, so he would never allow her to touch him. He would keep his distance, ignore, and have nothing to do with her. He considered his judgment and knowledge, opinions and behavior to be better than others. He expected Jesus to judge and act as he did. He thought that if Jesus only knew who the woman was, then He would reject her. Many live so self-righteous. They feel that they live better and act superior.
3.    He felt no need for forgiveness and repentance. He thought he was good enough.


a.  He was good enough in religion. He was a Pharisee, a man who had given his life to practice formal religion. If anyone was good enough, he should be.



b.  He was good enough in behavior. He was well mannered, well behaved, polite, decent and moral, honest, just and upright, respected, valued, prized, and highly esteemed. He was not immoral; in fact, he wanted nothing to do with immorality. In his mind he had not and never would commit a sin that would be publicly condemned. Therefore, he felt as though he had done nothing to need forgiveness.

> Lu 7:37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,

The Attitude of the Penitent

The woman was a sinner, a (prostitute). She demonstrated the attitude of repentance in coming to Jesus.

1.    She sensed her need. She was convicted of her sin while hearing and seeing Jesus. 

His preaching for men and women to repent and prepare for the Kingdom of God pierced her heart with a very strong conviction. She knew she was a sinner: unclean, lost, filthy, dirty, and condemned. The guilt, shame, disgrace and weight of her sin was more than she could bear. Her soul was throbbing for forgiveness and cleansing, for freedom and liberty and she humbled her self and received His forgiveness.

2.  She approached the Lord,

She knew that the public scorned and thought evil of her, and the so-called respectable people wanted nothing to do with her. What would Jesus do? Thinking of her need she went to Jesus and stood behind Him at His feet. The people of the East recline to eat. They rested on their left arm facing each other around the table with their body and feet extending out away from the table.

3. She surrendered to the Lord in utmost humility.

She was overcome with conviction and emotion. She fell at Jesus' feet weeping and so broken the tears just kept flowing from her eyes. She let down her hair and wiped and kissed Jesus' feet. Very seldom has love and devotion been shown to Jesus like that.
There was only one thing that could make a prostitute enter a Pharisee's home desperation. She was gripped with a sense of shame, of helplessness, of urgency. The loosening of her hair to wipe Jesus' feet was forbidden of women in public. She must have been so desperate. She was surrendering her heart, soul and life to the Lord, She was so broken she was unable to speak, but Jesus knew her heart. Jesus knew Simon&apos;s heart as well and Words were not necessary for either of them for Jesus to know what was going on.

4. She loved much, giving her most precious possession.

Perfume was highly valued by women of that day. Luke stresses the expense of the perfume and the great sacrifice she was making. It was probably the most costly possession she had, so she was giving it to her Lord. She anointed His feet in an act of humility, love and surrender Lu 7:49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
Lu 7:50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much
