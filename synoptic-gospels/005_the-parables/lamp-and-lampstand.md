PARABLE OF THE LAMP AND LAMPSTAND
MATTHEW 5:15,MARK 4:21,LUKE 8:16

The lamp in these scriptures represents the truths which the Lord has imparted to His disciples. These truths were not to be hidden, but in the open, where they could be seen.
The basket could represent business, or whatever may steal time, time that belongs to the Lord. The bed may speak of comfort, or laziness, both enemies of evangelism.
