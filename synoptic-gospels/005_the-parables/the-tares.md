Main Entry: 1tare

Etymology: Middle English; probably akin to Middle Dutch tarwe wheat

Darnel also called Tare, noxious weed of the ryegrass
Vetch also called Tare, any herbaceous plant of the genus Vicia, within the pea family. About 150 species are known. The plants are 30&mdash;120 cm (1&mdash;4 feet) tall, with trailing or climbing stems and compound leaves with several pairs of leaflets. The magenta, bluish white, white, or yellow flowers are borne singly or in clusters. Two to ten seeds are borne in a pod. A few species of vetch are cultivated as important fodder and cover crops and as green manure. Like other legumes, they add nitrogen to the soil by means of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and thus are particularly valuable as a soil-enriching crop. 
Mt 13:25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
The Enemy is the devil - he is an imitator &mdash; he plants false &quot;Christians - doctrines"
False growth
False people
26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
The responsibility of a true Christian is to plant the true not pull up the false.
Sow the Word of God and bear fruit
30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
The field is not human hearts but the world, Satan is sowing counterfeit believers
40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
1.   Christ, does His work to sow righteous people in the world.
2.  The man, Christ, owns the world. The world is "his field."
3. The enemy is the devil, the liar, the deceiver, the one who struggles against the truth. The tares are the children of the devil or the wicked one 
4 Seed is to bear fruit. If it does not, it is either dead or else it is not real seed.



The devil operates under the cover of darkness and deception.
1. The devil does his work to sow wicked or lawless people in the world and to do it secretly so that they will not be noticed  
2. The devil sows in the same field as the Lord. The bad are sown among the good. The devil's method is counterfeit and imitation. Some within the world and within the church have not been sown by the Lord. They may be in the world and in the (church); they may even look like they belong to Him, but they do not.
3. The devil is a sworn enemy to Christ, to the world, and to all good. He is the sworn enemy of man, to his peace, and to the fulfillment of his purpose and life on earth. Whatever power he uses on earth is the same as the power used by wicked men: it is usurped and unjust 
4. One reason so many tares are sown is because so many righteous are sleeping when they should be watching over the field. Satan never sleeps; he is ever awake for every opportunity.
5. "He went his way." Satan does not want to be known as the sower of wicked men. In fact, he wants the wicked to disclaim him, never to confess that he is their "father" (John 8:44). The tares are "in the Lord's field" professing that they belong to God, but they are deceived (2 Cor. 11:13-14).
6. The tares themselves were called "darnel," some form of plant or wild corn that was slightly poisonous and narcotic. When eaten it would cause dizziness and nausea. It was called the (illegitimate) wheat. Its roots became intertwined with the roots of the wheat. If it was rooted up it would destroy the wheat plant before the fruit became mature. The method used to get rid of it was to let it grow and then to harvest it with the wheat. It was then separated from the wheat, bundled together, and cast into a flaming fire.
7. The tares (unregenerate) looked like wheat when sown and during the growing stage. All men appear the same in religious practices. It is during the fruit-bearing stage that the difference appears. Unregenerate men can imitate true believers for only so long; eventually their true nature begins to show.
8. A person's nature always comes out eventually. A tare shows itself. A wicked person may profess to be righteous, but a life of selfishness and unrighteousness will eventually take hold. The profession may continue, but so will the life of wickedness.
 9. The tares (wicked) among the wheat (righteous) are hurtful to the wheat.
a.   They are an evil reflection upon the wheat. They sometimes make it very difficult for the world to distinguish between good and evil; they are the primary cause for the finger pointing of hypocrisy leveled against the church.
b.   They stymie the growth of the wheat. Their behavior and conversation and thoughts are centered in the world, not on Christ. Therefore the righteous are not edified when tares are clinging to them.
c.  They are a threat to the wheat by drawing much needed nourishment from the wheat. The professing tare can tempt and lead the righteous away from the Lord and His nourishment, tempt and lead the righteous into the world and its delights.
d.   The professing tare can persecute and even kill the wheat.
