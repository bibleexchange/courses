 The Lost Coin
Lu 15:8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it? 
 9 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.
 10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
