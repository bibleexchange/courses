The Unjust Steward
                                                           Luke 16:1-13 
Lu 16:1 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
Lu 16:3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. 
Lu 16:8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.
9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. 
10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? 
12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?
13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
Guilty of Wasting the Goods
Lu 15:13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.

1Pe 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:
 2Pe 2:9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:
Re22:11He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy
still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still  
Zep3:5The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.
Ac 1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take. 
Pr11:7When a wicked man dieth his expectation shall perish and the hope of unjust men perisheth
                                                      The Condescending Master

Lu 17:7 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?
 8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
 9  Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
 10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.
I.	We can not ignore the everyday responsibilities of life.
II.	We must keep a proper attitude for Christian Service.

Eph 6:6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
Col 3:22 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:
 23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
 24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
 25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
III.	Serving the Lord should be a Delight not just a duty
Ps 40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.
Ro 7:22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man
Ps 1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
  
It is our Duty to obey God
Duty before service
Service before reward  
Humility  before  honor                    Servant to all.

Pr 15:33  The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.
 Pr 18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.
1Co 9:16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
 17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.
1Co 4:1  Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.  
God commands perfection; therefore, at the first He expects humility.
God demands obedience; therefore, at the first He supposes dependence.     
God orders Love; therefore, at the first He requires faith    
It takes faith for the Impossible
It takes faith for the Difficult
It takes faith for the Simple   
The very smallest works canâ€™t go by without faith                                 

1Jo 4:17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world
