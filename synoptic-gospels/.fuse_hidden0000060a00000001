Mark
====

## The Author

### Mark

#### There is no reference to its author, but most agree it was John Mark.  

##### John is his Jewish or Hebrew name.

##### Mark is his Roman or Latin name.

##### He was the son of Mary and the cousin of Barnabas.  

###### Mary was a woman of money because she supposedly owned her home and kept slaves.

#### Mark was converted by Peter who called him “my son” in I Peter 5:13

#### Mark accompanied Paul and Barnabas to Antioch.  

##### Some feel some trouble here because Mark left  (Acts 12:25, 13:5)but it was resolved because he was later with Paul at Rome (Col. 4:10)  and Paul during his last Roman imprisonment, asks Timothy to come to him and to bring Mark also (II Tim. 4:11)

#### Mark was probably written around 50 AD

## The Purpose

### We can see the purpose of the book in the key verse.

#### Mark 10:45

### Mark presents a servant.

## The People

### Mark is writing to the Romans.

#### Unlike Matthew, Mark was not trying to prove certain statements and prophecies concerning Jesus the Messiah.

#### The Romans were more concerned with deeds than words so Mark’s gospel is full of action.

#### The Romans were people of action rather than thought.

#### Mark presents Christ as the mighty worker rather than a profound thinker.

#### He presents Jesus as the man who conquers by doing.

#### So we have the vivid and rapid record, with little discourse and much movement and accomplishment.

### Characteristics of a Roman

#### The Roman was different than the Jew.

##### His strong point was his strong common sense.

##### His religion must be practiced.

### He would have no interest in tracing beliefs back into the past.

### Legal geaneologies and fulfillment of prophecies would leave him cold and hard hearted.

### One writer said a Roman might say, “I know nothing of your scriptures, and care nothing for your peculiar notions; but I would be glad to hear a plain story of the life this man Jesus lived. Tell me what He did.  Let me see Him just as He was.”

## General Characteristics of the Book

### It has been said the skill of an artist may lie in what he leaves out.

An amateur crowds everything in. We can see this with Mark.

#### There is nothing about the virgin birth. 

No reference to His birth is made in the whole Gospel.

### No one is interested in the pedigree of a servant.

#### There is no visit of the wise men.

### A servant does not receive homage.

#### There is no account of the boy Jesus in the temple.

##### servants are not important as children.

#### There is no Sermon on the Mount.

##### A servant has no kingdom and frames no laws.

#### There are no continual quotations from the prophets. Only one in 1:2. Matthew quotes on every page.

#### No divine titles are used. Jesus is never called “King” except in derision.  Matthew says, “They shall call His name ‘Emanuel’“ (God with us).

##### Mark calls Him Master where others call Him Lord.

###### Matthew - “Lord, save us; we perish”

###### Mark - “Master, carest thou not that we perish?”

#### There is no statement that His work is finished at death. In John 19:30 He said, “It is finished.”

##### A servant does not say when his work is done.

#### There is no introduction in Mark. The other Gospels have lengthy openings, but none in Mark.

##### A servant has no introduction.

### Key Verse - Mark 10:45

### Key Word - “straightway” also translated “immediatly,” “forthwith," and "anon"

#### Used 42 times in the book.

#### Definitely servant's words.

### The word gospel is used twelve times in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John together.

#### Eight of those times are in Mark.

##### The servant is to bear the “Good News”

### Twelve out of the sixteen chapters of Mark begin with the word "and."

#### His service was continuous and constant.

### Mark is the shortest Gospel -

#### Sixteen chapters and four parables.

### Parables

#### Matthew records fourteen parables

####  Mark only four parables

##### The sower

##### The seed growing secretly

##### The mustard seed

##### The wickeed husbandman

#### There is nothing about the householder or the marriage of the “king’s son” or the “talents”.

### Miracles

#### They have a leading place in Mark as parables have in Matthew.

##### A king speaks, but a servant works.

#####  Mark describes more of Jesus’ miracles more than he records Christ’s’ parables.

##### Twenty miracles are given in Mark in detail.

### Jesus is portrayed as the humble but perfect servant of Jehovah and we find angels ministering unto Him.

## Preparation

### The Servant Prepared

#### Jesus

##### Prepared thirty years before entered into public ministry.

#### Life

##### The plant sends it’s roots into the soil before it brings forth the flower and leaf for all to see.

#### Moses

##### Fourty years in the desert before he entered into his great work.

#### David

##### Thirty years old when made king.

#### John the Baptist

##### Thirty years before entered into ministry.

#### Getting ready for our life’s work is of tremendous importance. Sometimes God uses much time in preparing us.

### Preparation by John the Forerunner

#### Mark begins with John the Baptist making ready for the coming of the Messiah.

#####  John’s coming was in fulfillment of a Messianic prophesy 1:2

###### Malachi 3:1   Isaiah 40:3

#### God does not always choose the kind of men we would select.

##### John the Baptist

###### Clothed with camel's hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins.

###### His food locusts and wild honey.

##### God often picks the foolish things to confound the wise and the weak things to confound the things that are mighty.

###### I Cor. 1:27-29

#### No doubt some would have chosen the herald for Christ as one of high birth, university trained, a man of wide reputation, eloquent and a success.

Not so with God!

##### John was of humble birth, little known, did not graduate from an accredited college, and was dressed like a desert hermit.

#### But, as they went before kings to repair the roads so John went before The King to prepare the hearts. His messag was startling as his appearance.

##### “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.”

##### A true revival is always a revival of righteousness.

### Preparation by Baptism

#### John hesitated to baptise Jesus.

##### Matt. 3:14  “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?”

#### Jesus was baptized with John’s baptism in obedience to an appointed ordinance.

##### Matt. 3:15  “Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.”

##### Christ was the example of righteousness.

### Preparation By The Holy Spirit

#### Mark 1:10

##### In any service for God, we need the Holy Ghost to prepare and give us power.

#### Acts 10:38

##### God appointed Jesus of Nazareth

### Preparation By A Divine Call

#### Mark 1:11

##### “There came a voice from heaven.”

#### Mark 9:7

##### “This is my Beloved Son, hear him.”

### Preparation By Testing

#### Mark 1:12

##### “And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.”

###### Driveth = servant Mark 1:12

###### Led up = king Matt. 4:1

##### Out of the experience of the baptism comes the test.

##### It was a divine appointment, not an accident or evil fate. We would never develop without the trial.

##### James 1:12

###### “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love Him.”

#### We do not need to run into temptation of our own accord.  

##### Jesus was led or driven by the spirit.

#### We must walk the path that is set before us.  If it is through a trial, we must pray “thy will be done”.

#### I Cor. 10:13

##### “But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able...”

##. The Servant

### The Sonship of The Servant

#### Stated by Mark

##### Mark 1:1

#### Supported by John

##### John 1:28

#### Settled by the Father

##### Mark 1:9-11

### The Servant Working

#### There is continuous, unbroken service of the servant recorded in this Gospel.  

###  And He did this - And He said that

* He taught men, they were in darkness
* He cheered men, they were without hope
* He healed men, they were sick and suffering
* He freed men, they were under the power of Satan
* He cleansed men, they are sinful

#### He 
called His disciples.

##### He selected 4 fishermen to become 4 fishers of men.

##### They were to turn all the practical knowledge and skill over for God's use.

##### Mark 1:18

###### Straightway they forsook their nets, and followed Him.

###### Too often too much time between the call and our coming.

#### He worked with compassion.

##### Mark tells us Jesus...

###### ...took the little children in His arms

###### ...was grieved

###### ...sighed

###### ...loved

###### ...was angry

###### ...was touched with the feelings of our infirmities.

#### This is a Gospel of compassion.

### The Servant At Prayer

#### Mark 1:35

##### Then they went on working.

##### If the Son of God needed to pray before He undertook His work, how much more should we.

##### Some of the lack of success and victory is because we fail at this point.

#### Mark 3:14

#####  He ordained the 12

#####  That they might be with Him.

######  He wants us with Him.

###### Communion with Him.

###### Make time to be in His presence.

###### Enjoy God

##### Then go forth and preach.

###### Mark 3:14,15

### The Servant Forgives Sin

#### Mark 1:40

##### Cleansed the leper

#### Mark 2:1

##### News spread, even without the newspapers or radios.

#### Mark 2:3,4

##### They brought him who was sick of the palsy.

##### Sometimes we need others to help  bring us to  Jesus.

###### These friends knew where Jesus was.

###### Choose your friends wisely.

(a) Prov. 14:7

#### Mark 2:7

##### Not only the healer of the body but the healer of the soul.

##### Only God can forgive sin.

### The Servant Rejected

#### Even before Mark sets forth Christ’s claim to be King of the Kingdom, he reveals the way the servant is to be received.

#### Jesus tells His disciples He is to be rejected by the elders, chief priests and scribes.  Mark 8:31

##### He is to be delivered by treachery

Mark 9:31

##### He is to be put to death by the Romans

Mark 10:32-45

##### He is to rise again the third day

Mark 9:31

#### It is said Jesus was sold for thirty pieces of silver - the price of a slave.

#### He was executed as only slaves were.

#### No reference was made in Mark that in the garden He had the right to summon twelve legions of angels, if He so willed.

#### No promise of the kingdom is given to the dying thief on the cross.

##### These things were said by the King in Matthew but not by the servant in Mark.

### The Servant Exalted

#### After the servant had given His life a ransom for all, He arose from the dead.

#### The great commission in Mark 16:15-18 and Matt. 28:19-20

Read and compare.

#### I Cor. 3:9

##### Laborers with Him

#### I Cor. 15:58

##### Must labor always

#### Phil. 2:7-9

##### He who had taken upon Him the form of a servant was received in Heaven to sit on the right hand of God.

##### Once in the form of a servant, now highly exalted.
