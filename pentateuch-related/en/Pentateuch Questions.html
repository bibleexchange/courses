They seem to have originally occupied the land stretching from the heights west of the Dead Sea (Ge 14:7) to Hebron (Ge 14:13. Comp. Ge 13:8; De 3:8; 4:46-48), embracing &quot;all Gilead and all Bashan&quot; (De 3:10), with the Jordan valley on the east of the river (Ge 4:26), the land of the &quot;two kings of the Amorites,&quot; Sihon and Og (De 31:4; Jos 2:10; 9:10). The five kings of the Amorites were defeated with great slaughter by Joshua (Jos 10:10). They were again defeated at the waters of Merom by Joshua, who smote them till there were none remaining (Jos 11:8). It is mentioned as a surprising circumstance that in the days of Samuel there was peace between them and the Israelites (1Sa 7:14). The discrepancy supposed to exist between De 1:44 and Nu 14:45 is explained by the circumstance that the terms &quot;Amorites&quot; and &quot;Amalekites&quot; are used synonymously for the &quot;Canaanites.&quot; In the same way we explain the fact that the &quot;Hivites&quot; of Ge 34:2 are the &quot;Amorites&quot; of Ge 48:22. Comp. Jos 10:6; 11:19 with 2Sa 21:2; also Nu 14:45 with De 1:44. The Amorites were warlike mountaineers. They are represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, aquiline noses, and pointed beards. They are supposed to have been men of great stature; their king, Og, is described by Moses as the last &quot;of the remnant of the giants&quot; (De 3:11). Both Sihon and Og were independent kings. Only one word of the Amorite language survives, &quot;Shenir,&quot; the name they gave to Mount Hermon (De 3:9). </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">EASTON&rsquo;S</span></p><p class="csE71256D6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Moses thought it necessary to introduce it with an account of the names and number of the family of Jacob when they came to Egypt, to show that though they were then very few, yet in a short time, under the especial blessing of God, they had multiplied exceedingly; and thus the promise to Abraham had been literally fulfilled.
