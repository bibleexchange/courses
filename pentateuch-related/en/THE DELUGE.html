		<p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csAEEDF97E">By James L. Hall</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Genesis chapters six through eight describe the great flood of Noah&rsquo;s time. It was literally the greatest catastrophic event to affect the earth since Creation. &nbsp;In a previous monograph, I described the canopy and some of the scientific support for its existence. &nbsp;Now we will examine the evidence for this great event.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Scripture describes the beginning of the Flood in Genesis 7:11. &nbsp;Notice that the fountains of the great deep were broken up and followed by the windows of heaven being opened. &nbsp;This sequence is important. &nbsp;The fountains broken up would imply that volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tidal waves would have occurred.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Volcanoes would spew ash high into the atmosphere and precipitate the canopy. &nbsp;If this were a fact them we should find volcanic ash in the sedimentary rocks. &nbsp;This is precisely what one finds. &nbsp;Even in the ice and tundra of the Arctic and Antarctic, volcanic ash has been found hundreds of feet deep.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">I personally found some volcanic ash sediment in Nebraska during the summer of &rsquo;86. &nbsp;I was collecting some fossil specimens for our museum in a formation that contained volcanic ash. &nbsp;The universal presence of volcanic ash in the sedimentary rocks gives credence to the scriptural account.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Scripture indicates that the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred fifty days (five months) and upwards to fifteen cubits above the highest hills. &nbsp;It is rather significant that the author indicates the depth. &nbsp;Compare this with the dimensions of the Ark: three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. &nbsp;When the Ark was loaded it would sink to half of its height. &nbsp;This is the draft of the Ark or fifteen cubits. &nbsp;This means that when the Ark was fully loaded it would sink to fifteen cubits (draft) and would have to pass safely over the highest submerged hill. &nbsp;Remember the waters prevailed upward to fifteen cubits. &nbsp;This kind of accurate detail gives credence to the Flood account in Genesis. &nbsp;It should not be treated as allegory as some would have us believe.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">The dimensions are also interesting in this respect. &nbsp;Consider the pre-Flood environment with no seasons, storms, etc. &nbsp;Two-thirds of the earth was probably dry land with the remaining one-third seas. &nbsp;In the time of Noah, the knowledge of shipbuilding was not far advanced, if in existence at all. &nbsp;Noah was told to construct a vessel of huge dimensions. &nbsp;If Noah dreamed up the size of the Ark, his knowledge was supernatural. &nbsp;How would he know about the draft of the Ark and the depth of the waters? &nbsp;The Ark was six times longer than it was wide. &nbsp;This is the plan that modern shipbuilders use and they have had the opportunity of drawing on the experience of centuries of shipbuilding. &nbsp;All of this points to the supernatural involvement of the Creator.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">The Ark was designed to float not sail. &nbsp;Being shaped like a barge it would have a greater cargo capacity. &nbsp;Dr. Henry Morris has studied the stability of the Ark in a stormy environment using models. &nbsp;He found the Ark would have tipped almost vertical before capsizing, which again demonstrates the unique design.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">The flood was on the earth for over a year. &nbsp;It is rather interesting to study what happened to the floodwaters at the close of the flood. &nbsp;Genesis 8:1-3 describes a wind, the stopping of the windows of heaven, and the restraining of the fountains of the great deep. &nbsp;According to the chronology of the flood, this would leave over 200 days for the waters to recede and the dry land appear.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">It is obvious that the waters just didn&rsquo;t dry up and evaporate into the clouds for there isn&rsquo;t that much water in the present atmosphere. &nbsp;So where did the water go?</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Scripture has the answer in Psalm 104:6-8. &nbsp;Here it says the mountains rose and the valleys sank. &nbsp;So for 200 days or more the mountains began rising and the valleys were slowly sinking. &nbsp;Consider Mt. Everest at 28,000 feet and the Marianas Trench at over 36,000 feet deep. &nbsp;The mountaintops are covered with fossils, proof of their being submerged in water. &nbsp;Geologists today know that the mountains are young.</span></p><p class="cs4817DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">So when one examines the flood events with the known facts of science he sees an agreement. &nbsp;This fact should make us realize that the flood was God&rsquo;s judgment for sin and, as Peter said in II Peter 3:14, &ldquo;that ye may be found&hellip;without spot, and blameless.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
