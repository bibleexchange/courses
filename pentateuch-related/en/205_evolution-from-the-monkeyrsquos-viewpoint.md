# Evolution From The Monkey's Viewpoint

Three monkeys sat in a coconut tree

Discussing things as they're said to be.

Said one to the others, "Now listen you two,

There's a certain rumor that can't be true.

That man descended from our noble race.

The very idea! It's a dire disgrace.

No monkey ever deserted his wife,

Starved his baby and ruined her life.

And you've never known a mother monk,

To leave her baby with others to bunk,

Or pass them on from one to the other,

Till they hardly know who is their mother.

And another thing you'll never see

A monk build a fence around a coconut tree,

And let the coconuts go to waste,

Forbidding all other monks a taste.

Why, if I put a fence around this tree,

Starvation would force you to steal from me.

Here's another thing a monkey won't do,

Go out at night and get on a stew.

Or use a gun or club or knife,

To take some other monkey's life.

Yes! Man descended, the ornery cuss,

But, brother, he didn't descend from US!
