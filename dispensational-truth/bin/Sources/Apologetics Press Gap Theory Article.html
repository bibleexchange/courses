		<p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is rare in the creation/evolution controversy to find issues on which both creationists and evolutionists agree. Generally speaking, the two world views are light-years apart. But there is one thing on which both sides agree: evolution is impossible if the Earth/Universe-system is young&mdash;with an age measured in thousands, not billions, of years. R.L. Wysong has commented: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Both evolutionists and creationists believe evolution is an impossibility if the universe is only a few thousand years old. There probably is no statement that could be made on the topic of origins which would meet with so much agreement from both sides. Setting aside the question of whether vast time is competent to propel evolution, we must query if vast time is indeed available (1976, p. 144).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is interesting to observe how something on which both sides agree has caused so much </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">dis</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">agreement. Aside from the basic issue of whether creation or evolution is correct, the most serious area of conflict between the biblical and the evolutionary scenarios is the chronological framework of history&mdash;in other words, the age of the Earth. This matter is of importance not only to evolutionists, but to theistic evolutionists, progressive creationists, and other &ldquo;old-Earth creationists.&rdquo; While a young Earth presents no problem whatsoever for a creationist, it is the death knell to each and every variety of the evolutionary scenario. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A simple, straightforward reading of the biblical record indicates that the Cosmos was created in six days only a few thousand years ago. Opposed to that view is the idea of evolutionists that the Universe is 15-20 billion years old, and that the Earth is 4.6 billion years old. Further complicating matters is the fact that the biblical record indicates living things were placed on the newly created Earth even before the end of the six-day creative process (e.g., plant life came on day three). The evolutionary scenario, however, postulates that primitive life evolved from nonliving chemicals roughly 3.5-4.0 billion years ago, and that all other life forms developed during the so-called geologic ages, with man arriving on the scene in one form or another 1-2 million years ago. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Even to a casual observer, it is apparent that this is no small problem. Much of the controversy today centers on the age of the Earth. The magnitude of the controversy is multiplied by two factors. First, theistic evolution and progressive creation are impossible if the Earth is young. Thus, if the proponents of these views wish to retain their belief systems, it is imperative that they find a way to place the time for an ancient Earth in the biblical record. Second, there is no middle ground that will permit the old-Earth/young-Earth scenarios to coexist; the gulf separating the biblical and evolutionary views on the topic of the age of the Earth is just too large. As Henry Morris has observed: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thus the Biblical chronology is about a million times shorter than the evolutionary chronology. A million-fold mistake is no small matter, and Biblical scholars surely need to give primary attention to resolving this tremendous discrepancy right at the very foundation of our entire Biblical cosmology. This is not a peripheral issue that can be dismissed with some exegetical twist, but is central to the very integrity of scriptural theology (1984, p. 115).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If the Earth is ancient, where in the Bible can the time be inserted to ensure that antiquity? The time needed to guarantee an old Earth might be placed: (a) </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">before</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the creation week; (b) </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">during</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the creation week; or (c) </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">after</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the creation week. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The attempt to insert geological time into the biblical text </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">during</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the creation week is known as the Day-Age Theory&mdash;a concept that has fallen on hard times in recent years because it is completely without lexical or exegetical support from the biblical record (see Thompson, 1982, 1994). As a result, it has been rejected by numerous old-Earth creationists, theistic evolutionists, and progressive creationists. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Rarely do those desiring to insert geologic time into the biblical record attempt to place the time </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">after</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the creation week, for two reasons. First, placing time after the creation has occurred does not help the case of the theistic evolutionist or progressive creationist. Time &ldquo;after the fact&rdquo; is a moot issue. Second, the biblical genealogies (e.g., Genesis 5, Genesis 11, Luke 3, etc.) have the text so well protected that it is manifestly impossible to insert the billions of years of time needed to allow for an ancient Earth (see Thompson, 1989). </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Thus, the Bible believer intent on accommodating his theology to the uniformitarian dogma of an ancient Earth must find another way to force vast time spans into Genesis 1. The only option remaining is to insert the time </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">before</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the creation week&mdash;a concept known as the Gap Theory. </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">THE GAP THEORY</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Popularity of the Gap Theory (also referred to by such synonyms as the Ruin-and-Reconstruction Theory, the Pre-Adamic Cataclysm Theory, and the Restitution Theory) is generally attributed to the writings of Thomas Chalmers, a nineteenth century Scottish theologian. In recent years, the Gap Theory has undergone an &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; of its own, and for that reason is not easily defined. There are several variations, and its defenders do not agree among themselves on strict interpretations. However, a brief summation of its main tenets might be as follows. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The widely held view among gap theorists today is that the original creation of the world by God, as recorded in Genesis 1:1, took place billions of years ago. The creation was despoiled because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion against God, resulting in his being cast from heaven with his followers. A cataclysm occurred at the time of Satan&rsquo;s overthrow, and is said to have left the Earth in darkness (the &ldquo;waste and void&rdquo; of Genesis 1:2). [NOTE: It is alleged by some Gap theorists that the cataclysm occurring at Satan&rsquo;s overthrow </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">terminated</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the geologic ages, after which God &ldquo;re-created.&rdquo; It is alleged by others that the cataclysm occurred first, and then was </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">followed</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> by the geologic ages, after which God &ldquo;re-created.&rdquo;] The world as God had created it, with all its inhabitants, was destroyed, which, it is claimed, accounts for the myriad fossils present in the Earth. Many holding to this theory place the fossils of dinosaurs, so-called &ldquo;ape-men,&rdquo; and other extinct forms of life in this gap. Then, God &ldquo;re-created&rdquo; the Earth in six literal days. By way of summary, then, the &ldquo;gap&rdquo; between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2 contains the story of an original creation, a judgment, and ruination, while the verses in Genesis 1:3 through the remainder of the chapter record the story of the Earth&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">re</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">-creation. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Is the Gap Theory Popular?</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Gap Theory has had, and continues to have, numerous supporters. George H. Pember, in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Earth&rsquo;s Earliest Ages</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (1876), advocated the Gap Theory. Harry Rimmer, in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Modern Science and the Genesis Record</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (1937), helped popularize the theory. The renowned Canadian anthropologist, Arthur C. Custance, produced </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Without Form and Void</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (1970), which many consider the ablest defense of the Gap Theory ever put into print. George DeHoff advocated the theory in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Why We Believe the Bible</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (1944). </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">J.D. Thomas, former chairman of the Bible Department at Abilene Christian University, has stated that &ldquo;no man can prove that it is not true, at least in part&rdquo; (1961, p. 54). The popular </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Scofield Reference Bible</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> was first published in 1909; by 1917, it contained a reference to the Gap Theory in the footnotes accompanying Genesis 1. In more recent editions, references to the theory may be found as a footnote to Isaiah 45. John Clayton has accepted major portions of the Gap Theory, but has added to and deleted from the theory to produce what has come to be known as the Modified Gap Theory (see Clayton, 1976, pp. 147-148; Thompson, 1977, pp. 192-194; McIver, 1988, 8[3]:1-23; Jackson and Thompson, 1992, pp. 114-130). </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Arguments Presented in Support of the Gap Theory</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Advocates of the Gap Theory base their beliefs on several arguments, a summary of which is given here; comments and refutation follow. </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csBF220092"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gap theorists suggest that the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (used in Genesis 1:1, 21, 27) </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">must</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> mean &ldquo;to create&rdquo; (i.e.: </span><span class="csC382D2BB">ex nihilo</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> creation), while the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">asah</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> cannot mean &ldquo;to create,&rdquo; but rather means &ldquo;to make.&rdquo; Therefore, the original creation was &ldquo;created&rdquo;; the creation of the six days was &ldquo;made&rdquo; (i.e., &ldquo;made over&rdquo;). </span></li><li class="csBF220092"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gap theorists suggest that the Hebrew verb </span><span class="csC382D2BB">hayetha</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (translated &ldquo;was&rdquo; in Genesis 1:2) should be rendered &ldquo;became&rdquo; or &ldquo;had become&rdquo;&mdash;a translation required in order to suggest a change of state from the original perfect creation to the chaotic conditions implied in verse 2. </span></li><li class="csBF220092"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gap theorists believe that the &ldquo;without form and void&rdquo; of Genesis 1:2 (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">tohu wabohu</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) can refer only to something once in a state of repair, but now ruined. Pember accepted these words as expressing &ldquo;an outpouring of the wrath of God.&rdquo; Gap theorists believe that the cataclysm that occurred was on the Earth, and was the direct result of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion against God. The cataclysm, of course, is absolutely essential to the Gap Theory. Isaiah 14:12-15 and Ezekiel 28:11-17 are used as proof-texts to bolster the theory. </span></li><li class="csBF220092"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gap theorists believe that Isaiah 45:18 (&ldquo;God created the earth not in vain&rdquo;&mdash;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">tohu</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">; same word translated &ldquo;without form&rdquo; in Genesis 1:2) indicates that the Earth was not </span><span class="csC382D2BB">tohu</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> at the initial creation. Therefore, they suggest, Genesis 1:2 can refer only to a judgment brought upon the Earth by God. </span></li><li class="csBF220092"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gap theorists generally believe that there was a pre-Adamic creation of both non-human and human forms&mdash;a position adopted to account for the fossils present in the geologic strata. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Gap Theory&mdash;A Refutation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I would like to suggest the following reasons why the Gap Theory should be rejected. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">1. The Gap Theory is false because of the mental gymnastics necessary to force its strained argumentation to agree with the actual biblical text.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Bernard Ramm, a progressive creationist, has admitted as much: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It gives one of the grandest passages in the Bible a most peculiar interpretation. From the earliest Bible interpretation this passage has been interpreted by Jews, Catholics, and Protestants as the original creation of the universe. In six majestic days the universe and all of life is brought into being. But according to Rimmer&rsquo;s view the great first chapter of Genesis, save for the first verse, is not about original creation at all, but about reconstruction. The primary origin of the universe is stated in but one verse. This is not the most telling blow against the theory but it certainly indicates that something has been lost to make the six days of creation anti-climactic. So entrenched has this theory become in hyper-orthodox circles that they feel as if the foundations are removed if this theory is criticized, whereas the majority of commentators feel that the entire theory has a peculiarity to it in that it makes the great creation chapter the second time round! (1954, p. 138, emp. in orig.).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">2. The Gap Theory is false because it is based on an incorrect distinction between God&rsquo;s creating (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">bara</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">) and making (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">asah</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">).</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">According to the standard rendition of the Gap Theory, the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">must</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> refer to &ldquo;creating&rdquo; (i.e., an &ldquo;original&rdquo; creation), while </span><span class="csC382D2BB">asah</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> can refer only to &ldquo;making&rdquo; (i.e., not an original creation, but something either &ldquo;made over&rdquo; or made from preexisting materials). A survey of these two words in the Old Testament, however, clearly indicates that they are used interchangeably. Morris has observed: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Hebrew words for &ldquo;create&rdquo; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) and for &ldquo;make&rdquo; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">asah</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) are very often used quite interchangeably in Scripture, at least when God is the one referred to as creating or making. Therefore, the fact that </span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is used only three times in Genesis 1 (vv. 1, 21, and 27) certainly does not imply that the other creative acts, in which &ldquo;made&rdquo; or some similar expression is used, were really only acts of restoration. For example, in Genesis 1:21, God &ldquo;created&rdquo; the fishes and birds; in 1:25, He &ldquo;made&rdquo; the animals and creeping things. In verse 26, God speaks of &ldquo;making&rdquo; man in His own image. The next verse states that God &ldquo;created&rdquo; man in His own image. No scientific or exegetical ground exists for distinction between the two processes, except perhaps a matter of grammatical emphasis... (1966, p. 32).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The insistence by Gap theorists, and those sympathetic with them, that the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">always</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> must mean &ldquo;to create something from nothing,&rdquo; simply is incorrect. In his commentary, </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Pentateuch,</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Old Testament scholar C.F. Keil concluded that when </span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> appears in its basic form, as it does in Genesis 1, </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">...it always means </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">to create</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and is only applied to a divine creation, the production of that which had no existence before. It is never joined with an accusative of the material, </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">although it does not exclude a pre-existent material unconditionally</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, but is used for the creation of man (ver. 27, ch. v. 1,2), and of everything new that God creates, whether in the kingdom of nature (Num. xvi.30) or of that of grace (Ex. xxxiv.10; Ps. li.10, etc.) (1980, 1:47, first emp. in orig.; last emp. added).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are numerous examples where </span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">asah</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> are used interchangeably. In Psalm 148:1-5, the writer spoke of the &ldquo;creation&rdquo; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) of the angels. Yet when Nehemiah addressed the creation of angels (9:6), he employed the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">asah</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to describe it. In Genesis 1:1, the text speaks of God &ldquo;creating&rdquo; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) the Earth. But when Nehemiah spoke of that same event (9:6), he employed the word </span><span class="csC382D2BB">asah</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. When Moses wrote of man&rsquo;s &ldquo;creation,&rdquo; he used </span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (Genesis 1:27). But one verse before that (1:26), he spoke of the &ldquo;making&rdquo; (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">asah</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) of man. Moses also employed the two words in the same verse when he said: &ldquo;These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">created</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> [</span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">], in the day that Jehovah </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">made</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> [</span><span class="csC382D2BB">asah</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">] earth and heaven&rdquo; (Genesis 2:4). </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gap theorists teach that the Earth was </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">created</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (</span><span class="csC382D2BB">bara</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">) from nothing in Genesis 1:1.

(1976, pp. 61-62, emp. in orig.).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">3. The Gap Theory is false because, in the context of Genesis 1:2, there is no justification for translating the verb &ldquo;was&rdquo; (</span><span class="cs31B015EA">hayetha</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">) as &ldquo;became.&rdquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gap theorists insist that the Earth </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">became</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &ldquo;waste and void&rdquo; after Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. Yet usage of the verb </span><span class="csC382D2BB">hayah</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> argues against the translation, &ldquo;The earth </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">became</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> waste and void&rdquo; (Genesis 1:2). Ramm has noted: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The effort to make </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">was</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> mean </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">became</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> is just as abortive. The Hebrews did not have a word for </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">became</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> but the verb </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">to be</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> did service for </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">to be</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">become</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The form of the verb </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">was</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in Genesis 1:2 is the Qal, perfect, third person singular, feminine. A Hebrew concordance will give all the occurrences of that form of the verb. A check in the concordance with reference to the usage of this form of the verb in Genesis reveals that in almost every case the meaning of the verb is simply </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">was</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. Granted in a case or two </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">was</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> means </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">became</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> but if in the preponderance of instances the word is translated </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">was</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, any effort to make one instance mean </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">became</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, especially if that instance is highly debatable, is very insecure exegesis (1954, p. 139, emp. in orig.).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The verb </span><span class="csC382D2BB">hayetha</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of Genesis 1:2 is translated &ldquo;was&rdquo; in all the standard translations because that is its meaning. Surely it is significant that none of the Old Testament linguists felt compelled to translate </span><span class="csC382D2BB">hayetha</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to suggest that the Earth </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">became</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> waste and void, as gap theorists propose. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">4. We reject the Gap Theory because </span><span class="cs31B015EA">tohu wabohu</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">does not mean only &ldquo;something once in a state of repair, but now ruined.&rdquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gap theorists believe that God&rsquo;s &ldquo;initial&rdquo; creation was perfect, but became &ldquo;waste and void&rdquo; as a result of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. Whitcomb has responded: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Without form and void&rdquo; translate the Hebrew expression </span><span class="csC382D2BB">tohu wabohu</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, which literally means &ldquo;empty and formless.&rdquo; In other words, the Earth was not chaotic, not under a curse of judgment. It was simply empty of living things and without the features that it later possessed, such as oceans and continents, hills and valleys&mdash;features that would be essential for man&rsquo;s well-being. In other words, it was not an appropriate home for man.... [W]hen God created the Earth, this was only the first state of a series of stages leading to its completion (1973, 2:69-70).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">5. The Gap Theory is erroneous because there is no evidence for the claim that Satan&rsquo;s rebellion was on the Earth, or responsible for any great &ldquo;cataclysm.&rdquo;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The idea of a cataclysm that destroyed the initial perfect Earth is not supported by an appeal to Scripture, as Morris has explained. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is, in fact, not a word in Scripture to connect Satan with the earth prior to his rebellion. On the other hand, when he sinned, he was expelled from heaven </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">to</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the earth.... There is, therefore, no scriptural reason to connect Satan&rsquo;s fall in heaven with a cataclysm on earth.... That Satan was not on earth, at least not as a wicked rebel against God, prior to Adam&rsquo;s creation, is quite definite from Genesis 1:31. &ldquo;And God saw </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">everything</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> that He had made, and...it was very good.&rdquo; ...Therefore, Satan&rsquo;s sin must have occurred after man&rsquo;s creation (1974, pp. 233-234, emp. in orig.).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">6. We reject the Gap Theory because its proof-text (Isaiah 45:18) is premised on a removal of the verse from its proper context.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Isaiah 45:18 reads: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the earth and made it; He hath established it, He created it not in vain [the phrase &ldquo;in vain&rdquo; is </span><span class="csC382D2BB">tohu</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, the same as &ldquo;without form&rdquo; in Genesis 1:2&mdash;BT], He formed it to be inhabited.</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Gap theorists suggest since Isaiah stated that God did </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">not</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> create the Earth </span><span class="csC382D2BB">tohu</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, and since the Earth of Genesis 1:2 </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">was</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">tohu</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">, therefore the latter could not have been the Earth as it was created in Genesis 1:1. The implication is that the Earth </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">became</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">tohu</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> as a result of the cataclysm precipitated by Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The immediate context, however, has to do with Israel and God&rsquo;s promises to His people. Isaiah reminded his listeners that just as God had a purpose in creating the Earth, so He had a purpose for Israel. Isaiah spoke of God&rsquo;s immense power and special purpose in creation, noting that God created the Earth &ldquo;to be inhabited&rdquo;&mdash;something accomplished when the Lord created people in His image. In Isaiah 45, the prophet&rsquo;s message is that God, through His power, likewise will accomplish His purpose for His chosen people, Israel. Morris has remarked: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There is no conflict between Isaiah 45:18 and the statement of an initial formless aspect to the created earth in Genesis 1:2. The former can properly be understood as follows: &ldquo;God created it not (to be forever) without form; He formed it to be inhabited.&rdquo; As described in Genesis 1, He proceeded to bring beauty and structure to the formless elements and then inhabitants to the waiting lands. It should be remembered that Isaiah 45:18 was written many hundreds of years after Genesis 1:2 and that its context deals with Israel, not a pre-Adamic cataclysm (1974, p. 241).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="cs91EF8B52">7. The Gap Theory is false because it implies death of humankind on the Earth prior to Adam.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Pember believed that the fossils (which he felt the Gap Theory explained) revealed death, disease, and ferocity&mdash;all tokens of sin. He suggested: </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Since, then, the fossil remains are those of creatures anterior to Adam, and yet show evident token of disease, death, and mutual destruction, they must have belonged to another world, and have a </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">sin-stained history of their own</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (1876, p. 35, emp. added).</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The idea that the death of humankind occurred prior to Adam&rsquo;s sin contradicts New Testament teaching which indicates that the death of humankind entered this world as a </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">result</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> of Adam&rsquo;s sin (1 Corinthians 15:21; Romans 8:20-22; Romans 5:12). Paul stated in 1 Corinthians 15:45 that Adam was &ldquo;the first man.&rdquo; Yet long before Adam&mdash;if the Gap Theory is correct&mdash;there existed a pre-Adamic race of men with (to quote Pember) &ldquo;a sin-stained history of their own.&rdquo; The Gap Theory and Paul cannot both be correct. </span></p><p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="cs91EF8B52">CONCLUSION</span></p><p class="cs425C14FF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In 1948, M.

They unanimously replied&mdash;No! (Henkel, 1950, p. 49, n. 30).
