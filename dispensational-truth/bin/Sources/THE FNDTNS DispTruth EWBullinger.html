and without them the</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">doctrines could not&nbsp; have been known.<br/><br/>Until He had suffered, died. risen. and ascended, how could the doctrines of Eph. 2: 5, 6 based on them be revealed&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">and taught.<br/><br/>But this special coming, ministry and guidance of &quot; the Spirit of truth &quot; must be held over for our next Editorial: for we</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">must of necessity&nbsp; include that last phase of what &quot; Jehovah hath spoken &quot;before we commence our consideration of&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">the Prison Epistles : for therein and only therein, do we find the &quot; riches &quot; of grace and glory into which the Holy Spirit</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">was to guide: them, the good news of which was destined to fill the long era of Israel&#39;s blindness and the nation&#39;s dark</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(spiritual,) night (Isa. 60:1-3).<br/><br/>The Prison Epistles, following immediately after the proclamation of Israel&#39;s judicial blindness and hardening (recorded</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;in Acts 28: 25, 26), have for their one great subject the revelation of the third of the three spheres of blessing and glory</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">which stands in special relation to Christ and His church.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">This sphere is</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">not </span><span class="cs31B015EA">on</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> the earth.</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">It is</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">not </span><span class="cs31B015EA">over</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> the earth</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.<br/><br/></span><span class="cs91EF8B52">It is in the highest heavens.<br/></span><span class="csCF6BBF71"><br/>Hence, it has nothing to do with earthly &quot; signs and wonders &quot;that would follow those who in happy obedience believe</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">what is there written.<br/><br/>Such surpassingly exalted language has never before, or since been spoken of human believers.<br/><br/>The very glory of that sphere is inconsistent with any earthly signs or manifestations however wonderful. or, ordinances&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">however once significant.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Those Epistles view the believer of them, not with &quot; signs following,&quot; but they view him as &quot; dead &quot; to this world and</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">all earthly associations and connections, and as having jointly suffered, jointly died, jointly risen, and being jointly&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">seated with Christ in the highest heavens.<br/><br/>Even the &quot;affections&quot;

in the air &quot; ; but about our presence&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">and manifestation with Him in His own glory; not about anastasis or resurrection (which is the subject of the earlier&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Pauline Epistles), but about an &quot;ex-anastasis,&quot; (Phil. 3: 11) and &quot;the calling on high&quot; (Phil. 3: 14) which is the subject&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">of the later Epistles; not about any personal happiness which we may have, but about Christ&#39;s personal glory, in which</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;we have the wondrous privilege of sharing.<br/><br/>In this connection we would call attention to one word, which, in our judgment, is the real key-word of the Prison</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Epistles, and of this third and highest sphere. It is a remarkable word, found. in this form, only here, in the New&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Testament. It occurs once before in Rom. 13:9, but there it is in the present passive voice (anakephalaioutai), and&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">means &quot; is summed up.&quot; But in Eph. 1:10&nbsp; it is the Aorist Infinitive of the middle voice, (anakephalaiosasthai). This</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">difference is ignored both by the Authorised and the Revised Versions, which read the middle voice of Eph. 1. to</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">as though it were the Active.
