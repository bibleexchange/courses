apostle having, in the preceding chapter, shown the converted
Gentiles the obligations they were under to live a holy life,
addresses himself here to the Jews who might hesitate to embrace the
Gospel; lest, by this means, they should renounce the law, which
might appear to them as a renunciation of their allegiance to God.
As they rested in the law, as sufficient for justification and
sanctification, it was necessary to convince them of their mistake.
That the law was insufficient for their justification the apostle had
proved, in chapters iii., iv., and v.; that it is insufficient for
their sanctification he shows in this chapter; and introduces his
discourse by showing that a believing Jew is discharged from his
obligations to the law, and is at liberty to come under another and
much happier constitution, viz. that of the Gospel of Christ, Ro
7:1-4. In Ro 7:5 he gives a general description of the state of a
Jew, in servitude to sin, considered as under mere law. In Ro 7:6 he
gives a summary account of the state of a Christian, or believing
Jew, and the advantages he enjoys under the Gospel&mdash;Adam Clarke.</font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Paul
now moves from the law of sin and draws illustration from the Mosaic
Law. As a man is bound to is wife so long as they both live, so does
the law having binding power over a person as long as they live in
the flesh. Death looses a man or wife from their spouse and so death
of the flesh looses an individual from the law of sin. We cannot
serve God while in the flesh for we are bound by the law of nature to
sin. The flesh is the enemy of God and cannot be made subservient to
Him. The only freedom from sin is to be found in death of the carnal
man. When he dies then are we free to marry another. </font></font>

completes the chapter with a personal testimony to illustrate the
same principle. This is not Paul the Apostle&apos;s testimony per se but
Saul of Tarsus&apos; testimony. He was a man that was blameless
concerning the law, but yet found sin to be his master. The things he
would like to do he could not, and the things that he did not want to
do he did. Paul isn&apos;t presenting this as the condition of the
Believer where we just have to sin a little every day. No! Paul cries
out in testimony for deliverance. </font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>O

Clarke speaks concerning this twenty-fourth verse an interesting
note. &quot;&hellip;there seems to be here an allusion to an ancient custom
of certain tyrants, who bound a dead body to a living man, and
obliged him to carry it about, till the contagion from the putrid
mass took away his life!&quot; Paul is painting a startling picture in
order to awaken his readers to the reality of the gruesomeness of
sin. This picture of a dead body bound to a man is the parallel to
verse 25, </font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>I

For so is the condition of the regenerated man however good his
