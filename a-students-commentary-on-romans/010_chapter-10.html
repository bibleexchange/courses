1. Paul intercedes for the salvation of Israel. Paul is not spending
his prayer time trying to heap up treasures for himself, but he is a
man with a burden for others and especially here for Israel. There is
a great need in our day for people to recognize the serious and
destitute condition of others and do their part to reach them for
Christ. When Jerusalem would be besieged each family was being
responsible to defend a portion of the wall. As casualties occurred,
throughout the course of the battle, some sections would be seriously
depleted of defense or even completely removed of it. It is in this
setting that Ezekiel 22:30 makes its plea for people to recognize the
need and step in where others have fallen and make up the gap in the
walll. </font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>And
I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and
stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy
it: but I found none.</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
The Lord found none in Ezekiel&apos;s day. Will he find one in ours?
There is a great price to pay. This kind of life is a crucified life
and not governed by the self-will, but the very heartbeat must be the
heartbeat of God. The heartbeat of God is for the salvation of the
lost. Let us stand in the gap and intercede for our people and then
for all people. </font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><i>&hellip;Ye
shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and
in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">&mdash;Acts
1:8. The progression from Jerusalem to ultimately the uttermost part
of the earth is very key. How can we effectively carry a burden for
someone we have never met, if we are calloused and without concern
for the spiritual condition of those immediately close to us?</font></font></p>
