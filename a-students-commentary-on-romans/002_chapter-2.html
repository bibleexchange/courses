man that condemns another for breaking the law while at the same time
he as well breaks the law is without a defense. This man condemns
himself with the words he intends to condemn another. We see here the
inconsistency of human judgment and man&apos;s biased decision-making,
but in verse two it is declared that God&apos;s judgment is according to
truth against not just this group or that group, but against those
that commit &quot;such things.&quot; God&apos;s judgment is according to
truth, unbiased, and absolute. A man may feel self-confident and sure
of his own place at the time he judges another, but without a doubt
he is without a defense--inexcusable--when the judgment of God comes.</font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Men
too often respond so vainfully to the mercy of God. When God does not
bring instantaneous judgment men often imagine they have escaped and
have &quot;gotten away&quot; with it, but in so doing they despise God&apos;s
goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering patience. They are without a
flicker of understanding that the reprieve they enjoy is the goodness
of God to lead them to and provide space for REPENTANCE. God is not
interested in simply destroying men in anger, but His desire is that
men would be saved and that could mean for some by as it were fire. </font></font>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Paul
clearly explains that while the hard and impenitent heart imagines
vainly that he has escaped instead of taking advantage of the mercy
and goodness of God he to the opposite effect stores up, treasures
up, against himself the wrath of God. In a time when pardon is
provided, the hard hearted and impenitent store up only more wrath
and condemnation. They heap up treasures of destruction over a
promise of treasures of righteousness. For God is not blind and
neither has He gone soft. God is longsuffering, but He also will
judge righteously EVERY man according to HIS DEEDS.</font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
righteous judgment of God will reward the obedient with eternal life,
but will judge the disobedient with tribulation and anguish. Again,
we see here were Paul emphasises that there is no difference between
Jew or Greek in regards to God. God will not judge the Jew one way
and the Greek another, but will judge every MAN (Jew or Gentile)
ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS for &quot;there is no respect of persons with
God.&quot;</font></font></p>

 <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Paul
presents a truth in verse twelve that he later explains in his
letter. Those that have not the law will die without the law, but the
law will judge those that have sinned in the law. It is not enough to
know about the law, but you must DO it. Does this mean that a Gentile
cannot be justified because he has not been given the law that he may
obey it as the Jews have? Absolutely not. The Gentile may do by
nature the things contained in the law without ever having it because
God has placed in every man a conscience whereas long as men guard it
and keep it are a law unto themselves in the proper and true sense of
the phrase. This law is written in their HEARTS and their conscience
bears witness to it.</font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
Jew that boasts in the law because he knows so much and is confident
as a guide for the blind is blind himself. That is, he believes he
knows the way, and no one else does. He stands in this place of great
self-confidence because he KNOWS the law, but THERE IS NO
RIGHTEOUSNESS IN KNOWING THE LAW. Paul speaks directly to emphasize
his point, &quot;Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou
steal?&quot; Paul is clearly presenting that just as the Gentile is
guilty because he DOES NOT the law and not that because he has not
the law as the Jews do, so also are the Jews not pardoned from their
guilt because they have and know the law, but they as well are judged
for not DOING the law. Their self-confidence is fool hearty for they
are as the blind leading the blind. They who are known in the world
abroad as God&apos;s chosen people bring their God dishonor and the
Gentiles blaspheme God through them. Their testimony is evil for they
boast in KNOWING the law, but dishonor God in BREAKING the law. The
issue for justification is not over if a man was born Jew or Gentile,
whether he has been circumcised or not, or if he has the law or not,
but has his HEART been circumcised? Has the hardness, impenitence,
and sin been cut out of his heart? </font></font>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
conclusion, the Jew that boasts in the Law and condemns the Gentile
is without a defense for he has broken the law himself. For he is not
a Jew which is one OUTWARDLY (born of the seed and line of Abraham),
but he is a Jew which is one INWARDLY whose circumcision is that of
the heart and whose praise is not of men, but of God. Here we can see
how that a Gentile may be grafted in, not as an earthly Jew, but as a
spiritual Jew who is a DOER and not a hearer only. We as well see how
that a Jew&apos;s justification rests not in his bloodline or knowledge
of the law, but he as well must be a DOER of the law. Every Jew needs
to add to his physical circumcision a circumcision of the heart
through repentance and a changed life. </font></font>
