Mark 9

Salt and Fire

Mount of Transfiguration

Boy possessed of the devil. There are people hurting and God has given to us what it takes to help them.

Be ready for a fresh word.

**TEXT**: Mark 9:49

> Mr 9:49 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. 50 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

Some experiences harder than others, but EVERY ONE shall be salted with fire.

Not everyone will respond the same way, but  everyone is given the opportunity to respond in worship to God.
