TEXT: 2 Timothy 4:1-5

This text is for those that truly have a heart for the things of God.

2Ti 4:1 Â¶ I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;  2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.  3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
 4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.

Many seek God, but some seek God to serve Him. If you truly serve God you will have to seek Him for that. "Lord, I want to see after you to serve YOU!"
