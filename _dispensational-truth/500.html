V. Dispensation of Law

INTRODUCTION

A. Duration of the Dispensation of Law

The duration of the fifth dispensation was the period of time from the Exodus to the Crucifixion. The Dispensation of Law covered a period of 1,718 years.

Galatians 3:24—Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. (Romans 10:4; Matt. 5:17; Acts 13:39; Romans 3:28,31; 8:3,4)


A. Divisions of the Dispensation of Law

This Dispensation is divided into four studies:
1. First Division – from the Exodus to the Reign of Solomon
2. Second Division – from the Division of the Kingdom to the Captivity
3. Third Division – from the Restoration to the end of the Old Testament
4. Fourth Division – the beginning of the New Testament to the Crucifixion

A. Description of the Law of God

1. The 613 commandments of the Torah are divided into three major categories: 

a. Spiritual Law – codified in the Ten Commandments which tell a person how to conduct their spiritual lives and how to deal with our fellow man.
b. Civil Law - deals with the running of civil society with God as head of that society.
c. Ceremonial law –Includes animal sacrifices, the priesthood, and other rules concerning the temple and worship.
1. The Law of God was a Covenant Israel Agreed to Keep
The law was a covenant between God and Israel. Israel committed themselves to do ALL that God commanded. This was the covenant which the children of Israel readily agreed to observe when they said to Moses, “You tell the Lord that all He hath said, we will do.”
Ex 19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. (Ex. 24:3,7; Deut. 5:27; Josh. 1:16; 2 Kings 10:5; Jer. 18:12; 42:20) 
Jas 4:15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. (2 Thess. 3:4)


1. The Law of God is Often Understood as the “Mosaic Covenant” since the initial instruction from God was given to Moses on Mount Sinai in the book of Exodus. (Ex. 19:1-Matt. 1:1-25)

1. The Dispensation of Law is clearly as vital to the perfect plan of God as the others, and yet the law is most often despised. The Law is rigid and unbending, and this is the narrow picture most have of God. 

1. The law though was not the full plan of God, but was as a Tutor “School Master” (Galatians 3:24) to teach man what God is expecting of man. Before in the Law we have the “What” (to know) but in the dispensation of Grace, God gives man the “How”(the enablement). (Romans 8:3)

A. Disappointment of Israel Under the Dispensation of Law

Israel’s vows were well intentioned but were broken over and over. They were about as unacquainted with the wickedness of their sinful hearts as men are today who declare that they can keep the Ten Commandments without any problem whatsoever. 
Jer 18:12 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.
Jer 42:20 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.

The people of Israel failed the test of the fifth dispensation as well as the previous four dispensations. They broke the Mosaic Law repeatedly. (Jer. 31:32; Eze. 16) God told them that they had a heart of stone. (Ezekiel 36:26 Zechariah 7:12)
Their failure brought God’s judgment upon Israel. The nation suffered many judgments during the fifth dispensation. Among the worst were:
The Assyrian Captivity
The Babylonian captivities, 
The Greek oppressions
The Roman oppressions, 
Israel’s temporary removal from its place of blessing (Romans 11), and its worldwide dispersion as the result of its rejection of Christ. 

Ex 19:1-8; 2K 17:1-18; 25:1-11; Ac 2:22-23;7:51-52; Ro3:19-20;10:5; Gal3:10

2. The Fall of Jericho 6
The ark represents the fullness of the spirit.The walls of Jericho came down because the Israelites followed the ark (inside contained the commandments of God), they were obeying the word. People’s shout will have some meaning if they live right and follow the word.

They crossed over Jordan somewhere 1420 B.C.The land rested somewhere in 1460 B.C. 5 speaks to us of grace and faith, - We need a lot of grace and faith to conquer the land in our life. In Israel’s conquest of the land, you find out they never did totally conquer the land, unless all is conquered, it will come back to destroy you. 
Nahum 1:3 – the Lord is slow to anger. Not everyone will go in, not everyone is going to enter in.
6. The Division of the land 13-22
7. The Death of Joshua 23-24

A. Israel Demands a King

After the death of Joshua, Israel demands a king. Judges never produced what they should have, because of the weakness of the flesh. In I Samuel 8, Samuel makes his sons judges, but they were wicked, and took money and bribes for certain judgments. 

1. King Saul (40 years) I Samuel 10:20-24; Acts 13:21
Saul was Israel’s first King. I Samuel 10:1- This is one of the saddest accounts written, Saul died as one having never been anointed. Acts 13:21 At the beginning of Saul’s reign he was a good man, but after a while, you find him doubting the prophet’s words, and performing his own sacrifices, I Samuel 16:13 
16:23 – Does God send evil spirit? In this sense when men go their own way, God takes his hand off and lets them go ahead, and even that, they have to get permission to attack someone. God does not give permission unless we are breaking his commandments, and also to test us, to see what is in us. Saul reigned for a long period of time, with an evil spirit. 

1. David Anointed King I Samuel 16:13
David was chosen to be the King of Israel by the Lord which marked the Brightest Era in Israel’s History. 16:6 – Samuel thought that Eliab was the one God had chosen, he had all the outward appearance of being the one, Man looks on the outside, but God looks at the heart
David was sought out because he had the power of God, There is no coincidence in our life, God has a plan. David was a man after God’s own heart, loved God more than anything else. 
In a time when kings were to go out to battle, David said to Joab you go, ill stay here. Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 If we rest in the time when we should be fighting, you cannot be successful not doing what God requires. Lust will cloud your mind, and deceive to do the so called pleasure of sin, to only leave you empty. 
David’s Death and Burial I Kings 2:10-11

1. King Solomon (40 years) 2:12;11:42-43
God said to Solomon, serve you with all your heart like you father David did. For one whole year though David was sorrowful, he never repented, until Nathan came to him and said that you are the man, When David repented of his sin, God forgave him, and put his sin in the sea of forgetfulness, never to be remembered of him again. That is why David could say what he said. You know David was a man of like passions as we are. Even when David was fleeing for his life, he lost everything, in the midst of that all, he turned to the Lord, and he brought back all. II Samuel 17:3
The Temple was built under Solomon’s Reign. 5:1-6
I Kings 2:10-11 - They called Jerusalem the city of David. David promised Bathsheba, that her son would be the king of Israel. All the wealthy and finery of this life should have no attraction to the little bride. One interest and one interest only that being Jesus, our lord. David desired to build the temple, but God said no, because he was a man that had blood on his hand. Now even though he was not allowed to build it, he gathered the material, so that when Solomon put the temple together, not a hammer was heard. It was said that the beauty of that temple was never to be comparable by any other temple that was built after it was destroyed. His wives turned his heart, Solomon, Solomon had been raised and tutored under his father of David. I Kings 11:42, 43 He said you be faithful in a few things he will make you ruler over many.

I. The Second Division of Law:
From the Division of the Kingdom to the Captivity

“Experiences of hard trying and testing is what taught me If I am going to preach this then I am going to believe this. The test is to cause us to overcome…You don’t start believing God for a million dollars, you start believing God with a dime. We are more than conquerors, so there is something to overcome.”—Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.

A. Solomon in his old age

1. Solomon’s Action – I Kings 11:1-8
a. Multiplied women (700 Wives and 300 Concubines)
a. Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
b. Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.

A man like Solomon (like Oral Roberts) had it but lost it. Don’t leave with that thought that a man who once had it cannot be restored. Peter who walked with God for three years and than denied Him but Peter was restored and became the spokesman for God. Would Peter have cursed and swore had he really known him?
→ AFTER ALL THIS – (after they had been such with God, and than lose all) II Chronicles 35:20; I Kings 11:2 He wasn’t just taking wives but he was doing it in direct disobedience.

1. God’s Reaction 11:9-28
a. The LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite:
a. God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah
b. Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda… even he lifted up his hand against the king.

The Lord hates backsliding. Hebrews 10:31 – It is one thing to have man angry at you, but it’s another when it is God who is made at you. David had a problem, but he got it to the Lord, and got it taken care of, and it was like it never happened to the Lord. Totally restored – God because of Solomon’s disobedience God is going to rend the tribes, but not in his days, because of David…God had a lot of feeling towards David, because David had a lot of feeling toward God. David loved 

1. The Prophecy of Ahijah 11:29-38
Over and over and over again speaking of David – Shows you the grace of God, When David knew that he did wrong, he repented.

2. Solomon’s Reaction to the Prophecy 11:40-43
When Solomon knew that he did wrong, he didn’t repent, but sought to kill the prophet of God, to fight God in essence. Not because of Solomon but because of David
A. The Division of the Kingdom

1. The Reason why the Kingdom was Divided 12:1-16
Sometimes young folks mean well, but sometimes there counsel isn’t good. And the word was fulfilled just as God had spoken, and the tribes were divided…
Illus: Assembly of God, meeting, young preachers, decided to disban any other ungodly activaties, and in that meeting they sold more pornography to those preachers than to the sinners in their hotels. If you let a little slide, soon before you know it the whole hills gonna come down. They rejected the counsel of the old men

2. Rehoboam’s action to Israel’s decision 12:18-19
…rebelled against the house of David unto this day…

3. Jereboam was made king over the Ten Northern Tribes of Israel 12:20
…only the tribe of Judah followed the house of David…

4. Samaria became the Capitol of the Northern kingdom :25
Jeroboam established two more places to worship.

5. Jereboam established Bethel and Dan as the places to worship 12:26-31
Convenience, not wanting them to go back to Jerusalem, the designated place that God had told them to worship, He established two other places to worship and puts idol in them to worship, other Gods, “One lesson you ought to learn for today, take counsel but take good counsel. Some will give you counsel but it may not be good. Don’t despise the old gray hairs.”The scripture says, take heed what you hear and take heed how you hear. 
REVIEW: Why did Rehoboam establish those other places? For the purpose that they would not go back to the Jerusalem and reestablish their allegiance to David’s kingdom. 
The kingdom was troubled from without and within because of their sin
Hebrews 12:1 – lay aside every weight and sin
God allowed the enemy to attack them because of the sin that was within them. 
We have a lot of trouble admitting that we are wrong and we are the ones with the sin in our life. Be careful of using continual the I, I did such and such and such and such. 

A. The Northern Kingdom lasted a little over 200 years

1. The Kingdom was continually troubled from within and frequently attacked from without.

2. The most known King and Queen of the northern Kingdom were Ahab and Jezebel. I Kings 16:30-31
Judah means praise. A Revelation of Pentecost, Out of Judah came Bana. Bana means worshiper of God. Imrai means polished (speakers). Imrai prodced omri. Omri means half heartedness – One of the saddest things, Jezebel is seducing our servants. Revelation 2:20; II Kings 17:17 
3. Not one of its nineteen kings were godly men.
Take a stand for truth, you will be persecuted. They attacked the ministry, they attacked God’s prophet. Out of the 19 kings that ruled that northern kingdom, not one of them was godly. 

4. Israel was carried away captive to Assyria in 724-722 B.C. – II Kings 17:1-6
They came in to lay siege, but it took 3 years to overtake Israel. II Kings 17:2

5. Their downfall and captivity was because of their rebellion and idol worship.
God hates idolatry, can we get by worshiping idols, Idolatry, is putting anything before God, letting that become a source to you that takes the place of God. You can make an idol out of most anything. You can make an idol out of himself. Whatever that we do, we need to do in the glory of God. What are we basically? Isaiah 41:14, thou worm JacobThings never satisfy. John Rockefeller, “How much more money would you need to be satisfied? And he said just one more dollar” 

A. Judah was reigned over by 19 Kings and 1 Queen
1. All were descendents of David.
God told Solomon he was going to stripe him and give them to an enemy of his. But he was going to preserve one tribe not for Solomon, but for David. 
2. Many of Judah’s Kings were Godly men.
3. Many great revivals and reforms were accomplished.
4. Eventually did evil in the sight of the Lord. 1Kings 14:22

“Judah also did evil in the sight of the Lord”
We don’t have to go through life sacred to death of the devil, but we at the same time need to be on guard against the devil who is doing anything to lure you away. 
The devil tries to make you think that it is so hard to be a Christian, but the Bible says and do you remember, how hard it is to be a sinner. 
But if you’re really living a Christian life, there is no life like the Christian life. 

A. Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Jerusalem

Besieged the city and caused them to pay tribute. God gave them a time that they could repent, but they did not, so God let them to be taken into bondage. For a while God warns you, but then he sends you into judgment. I don’t mind getting in trouble with people, but if I am in trouble with God, dear God. If you fail in one point, you will fail in all. Israel never knew defeat, only when there was trouble within. 

1. Judah and Jerusalem fell in the year 587-586
2. 470 years after the dedication of Solomon’s Temple –II Kings 25:1-11
3. The Judean captives were carried away captive to Babylon.

I. The Third Division of Law:
From the Restoration to the End of the Old Testament

A. Babylon fell to Cyrus, King of the Medes and the Persians

1. The Proclamation of Cyrus – Ezra 1:1-6
Daniel 2:39. 100 years before Cyrus was there was a proclamation to him, to take over. – Isaiah 45:1

2. Cyrus gave the Jews the vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem - Ezra 1:7-11
Ezra 8:24-This is a tremendous lesson about the vessels. Each man was responsible for what was given to him when he arrives. Don’t lose what God gives to you. Remember the man who hid his talent. Not only were they responsible for the weight but also for the number, by number and by weight. They didn’t travel by trains and plains but they traveled by foot. And along the way there were thieves and robbers, and they had to guard against that. 

3. The Reaction of the Jews to this Proclamation. - Psalm 126:1-3
We need to rejoice over our freedom from sin! But, also be cautioned concerning repeating the cycle. The cycle never seems to cease for the Jews, they rejoice because of being free and then they go back into bondage serving other gods. Aimee Semple McPherson when she started was a good person, but popularity got to her, Jimmy Swaggert had a tremendous impact on the Pentecostal churches, he could preach, you couldn’t fault him for his preaching, but it was for his living. He said himself; the devil came upon him and anointed him to play the piano. No step can be taken forward unless all your steps are pure. You have to be living right. Everything must be taken care of, God will not invest in a filthy vessel. God is looking for availability not ability. Comparatively so it is only a few people that are serving the Lord. <50,000 compared to 2 million> Try the best you can to pronounce the names; you have to know how to pronounce before your congregation, you lose something if you don’t. 

4. The number of the Jews that returned 49,697 - Ezra 2:64-65
As far as we can figure there was about 2 million that were taken away into captivity in Babylon. And they were there for 70 years. Out of those millions who were in bondage only 49, 697 went back. Where are the multitudes? That is the path that the world follows, but there are few that will go down the straight and narrow way. In actuality only 42,000 Jews actually went back. 

A. The Return of the Jews was Accomplished in Three Expeditions

1. The First Expedition
Under the Leadership of Zerubbabel -Ezra 2:1-2
Zerubbabel was God’s choice to bring the people back. NOTE: Learn how to pronounce names; it will help in the ministry. 


a. In Returning to the land they built an Altar - Ezra 3:1-3
The first thing that they did was building that alter showing the change in their heart. That alter had been left barren in all that time that they were in bondage. Our first choice should be Jesus. Not only do you offer to him but he also offers to you. God has a plan for every life, but not every life finds that plan. 
Why did they build an alter? Even though they got permission to return by the king, still they were surrounded by enemies. We need to maintain that alter. Should we have a certain amount of fear/respect? We Must Maintain An Alter. Realize we have an enemy continually perusing us. 
One time in, it speaks of an alter that is overgrown. It had not been used. At other times the alter was broken down; Elijah took the stones that were laid down, desolate and reared them up. There was one good prophet; Elijah; and 850 false prophets, and 400 that sat at Jezebel’s table. Don’t expect to be in the majority. Not everyone is going to love truth. Paul spoke of this last day, (I Timothy 4).
There are a lot of people saying just pray and God will answer. Why did God answer? I Kings 18:36 Elijah did all these things at thy word. Raised up those stones, God ready to put on the sacrifice, there was wood, cut the bullock up and laid it upon the alter, and then he washed the bullock. A lot will say Elijah didn’t want any funny business, but Elijah was obeying the word. The sacrifice has to be washed, it says in Leviticus. What will cleanse us; it is the washing of the word. 
“Availability is what you’re willing to do, Ability is what you can do, and Attitude is how you will do it.” We will not see a great moving of God with a cleansing. 

b. Shouting and weeping after the foundation of the Temple was laid Ezra 3:10-13
Great provision was made long before the first temple was built. David made great provision. The young men shouted but the old men wept. The new temple was of no comparison to the old temple. Nothing compared to the old temple.
This only says this to us. Sometimes we lose and never regain. We deserve nothing of the Lord, so we are to be happy and excited for what God is doing. The church is not mortar and bricks, but we are the temple of the Lord, the people are the church. The latter house shall be greater than the former house. II Peter 1:4 – by his great and precious promises we become partakers of his divine nature. Gold represent the nature of God. Silver represents the redemption of God. You can’t love sin and God at the same time; you can’t love error and truth at the same time. 

c. The building operation ceased for nine years until the second year of the reign of Darius -Haggai 1:1-15
We see a problem here. We can not take vacations spiritually. After God had been so good to them they were taken out of bondage and started the temple, but now they had ceased for 9 years. They had taken care of their houses but not the house of God. What is more important, your house or the house of God? What did Jesus say, don’t even take two coats. Matthew 10:10. They were putting money into bags with holes in it. They were working and laboring hard, sowed much, and reaped little. Remember the principal of tithing. → Consider Your Ways. Get to building my house, and you will be blessed. 
9 years and they were doing their own thing, and not the thing that the Lord had commanded them to do. Sometimes we get detoured from the vision that God has given to us. We need to be putting on the nature of Christ. What really is the heart of God? Reaching the lost; We need the heart of God, his nature to really produce a love for the lost souls. They say Portland is considered one of the most evil cities in America. But we are going to make a difference. We might not stop it all, but we are going to do our part. 
They were so excited, and than all the sudden it stops. Isn’t it so true with Christians, they are on fire, and than all of the sudden it stops.
Illus: Bernard S., was on fire for God for one solid year and than all at once he stopped; I was going to work, doing a lot of odd jobs and stuff, as a preacher, Bernard saved at 19 and left at 20 and than 7 years later, saw him again and talked with him for more than an hour, thought for sure he would come back to Christ, crying and miserable in his sin, one week later, he died crashing into a tree drunk. That liar of a preacher, who preached his funeral, said he went to heaven. 
This is something we should be excited of. Even if we don’t have feeling of jubilant, just think of where I am going, just the knowledge, and that should keep us excited, lets build, we need to build this house and build it strong, so it can stand the wind and stand the hurricane and get attached to the rock; rooted and grounded and stand against any storm. 
Israel neglected building the building. Please don’t take any vacations. They said that original foundation was overgrown. 
What did Jesus say, come apart and rest. There are some times we need to rest our mind and body. A day now and than is good for me; this is my life and it is not something I just do. Building on the temple, make it strong, make it stand. 
Is it possible to have the Bible as an idol? The paper and letter, the book itself can. But the truth of the word of God cannot, there can be no limit of devotion to the Bible. 
Swaggert had problems with demons, Branham had problems with demons, after a nervous breakdown twice, he pushed himself too much. God exalted his word above his name.

Alexander the Great died at the age of 32. He sat down and wept, and than drank himself to death, because he had conquered the than known world, he had conquered it all, that is why he wept.
