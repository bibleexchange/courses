VII. Dispensation of Righteousness

From the Second Coming of Christ

1. Dispensation of Righteousness - Kingdom Covenant Rev. 22:1-21

The final purpose in the plan of God is fulfilled, where righteousness reigns in man and not sin. God is going to work a complete work in us. The New Heaven and New Earth is only the backdrop to the goal and heart of God—fellowship completely restored. God is a holy God and cannot and will not fellowship with sin, but God in his infinite love and knowledge has made a way for us to enter into a place of unrestricted communion with Him separate from sin.

Christ reigns through Righteousness
After the Seven Years of the Tribulation hour when the wrath of God is poured out in judgment to bring men to repentance, Christ will return to the earth, He will reign in Righteousness over the earth for one thousand years. This is the millennium reign of Christ. The seat of His power will be New Jerusalem, and the saints, will be associated with Him in His glory. (See Isa. 2:1-4; Isa. 11; Acts 15:14-17; Rev. 19:11-21; Rev. 20:1-6.
Re 20:3, 7-8
Satan is loosed a little season, he finds the heart is easily deceived and effortlessly gathers the nations to battle against the Lord and His saints, known as the battle armengedomn and this last dispensation closes, like all the others, in judgment. 
The great white throne is set, the wicked dead are raised and finally judged, and then come the "new heaven and a new earth." 
Eternity is begun. (See Rev. 20:3,7-15; Rev. 21 and 22.)"
