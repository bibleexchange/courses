Addendum

Original Creation to Recreation

Original Creation to Recreation

Gen. 1:1—In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

Most Young Earth creationist organizations reject the gap theory, and say it is unscriptural, unscientific, and not necessary, in its various forms. YECs assert that the entire universe is only 6-10 thousand years old.

Neh. 9:6 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
Col 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

Job 38:6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 
7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

2. The Chaotic Earth - Gen. 1:2

(1) Scripture speaks of angels and authorities
Rom. 8:38-39; Eph.1:21; 3:10; 6:12; Col 1:16; 2:15; I Peter 3:22 
Original creation was inhabited

Lucifer was its ruler
Isa. 14:12-16 Eze. 28:11-17

He was created - vs. 15
He was anointed - vs. 14
He was perfect - vs. 15
His sin - Pride Eze. 28:17 Isa. 14:12-13
The effects of Lucifer’s sin - Rev. 12:4-9

(2) In Judging Lucifer God judged his kingdom
Gen. 1:2 The Word “was” “Hyah” “became”
“Tohu and Bohu” Jer 4:23


Refutations to Ruin and Reconstruction Theory

Refutations of
‘The Gap Theory’ or ‘Ruin & Reconstruction Theory’



1. Genesis 1:28 “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it:”

ARGUMENT: “RE-plenish means to fill AGAIN. This suggests it WAS full, then emptied and now needing to be filled AGAIN.”

Refutation: The Hebrew word here is male’. It is found in 240 verses. In all of these uses the emphasis of the word is to relay the thought of ‘making full’ or ‘wholly (completely)’ and not necessarily to make full again. (That is to say, it is not the ONLY way to translate the word.)
EXAMPLES: 
Gen. 42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

Gen. 24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.

Ex. 1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.

Job 15:2 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?



GODHEAD

THEIOS - Acts 17:29; 2 Pt. 1:3,4 
The Godhead; THE ONE TRUE GOD
Used instead of Theos purposely---(general: a god, or diety; not as strong a term)



THEIOTES - Romans 1:20 → the attributes of God; His Divine Nature and Properties

How much of God can be known from the revelation of Himself which may be known from the revelation of Himself which men may everywhere trace in the world around them. It is not the ‘personal God’ which men may know by these aids. He can be known only by the revelation of Himself in His Son. Hence:

THEOTES Col. 2:9 → The Divine Essence of God; personality of God

In the Son dwells the fullness of absolute Godhead (not temporally, not FILLED with, but was, is and always will be GOD


Characteristics of The Devil Gen. 3:1-5
1. Subtle- Vs. 1
Cunning -Crafty -Artful -Sly Treacherous -Operating secretly - Tricky -Slippery -II Cor. 11:3 Concealed himself ~ used a serpent

The Ancient View of Early Antiquity 

Early literate civilizations generally looked back to antiquity as the "golden Age," and thought of their own era as decadent. 

1. The ancient Egyptians mention their first historical epoch as the time: the gods ruled upon the earth.

2. The Chinese refer to the years before their great flood as when man reached his greatest perfection.

3. The sages of India thought of history in terms of four ages: the first of these, the Krita age, was the most glorious—when man knew no disease and lived for 400 years; the next two ages showed a steady degeneration from this time; then came the flood and after it this present age of Kali, the darkest time of human existence. 

4. The Greeks, too, perceived human history in terms of four ages: the best of these, the "Golden Age," ended when the: first woman, Pandora, opened the forbidden box; the following, ages of Silver and Bronze showed a steady worsening of the human condition; then came the flood and this present era.



FIND PLACE F OR NOTES:

2. Dispensation of Innocence - Edenic Covenant Gen. 1:1-3:24
God created man perfect and in His own image. God deals with man as a perfect infant—untested, but perfect still the same. Sin had not entered the world and so man for the first and last time was initially innocent.
3. Dispensation of Conscience - Adamaic Covenant Gen. 4:1-8:19 
God deals with man in the Dispensation of Conscience by his conscience. Everyone is born with a conscience which is not a curse but the providence of God at work. God has placed within man the awareness of what is right or wrong, of acts and motives then God holds man responsible to his conscience.
4. Dispensation of Human Government-Noahaic Covenant Gen.8:20-11:32
Man left to himself will self destruct, because of his carnal nature he is very heavily driven by his flesh and emotions, and so for a guiding force, God instituted human government. This did not replace man’s responsibility to God, but was to serve as a lower court of sorts. Man is ultimately responsible to God.
5. Dispensation of Promise- Abrahamic Covenant Gen. 12:1-Ex. 12:10
In God’s dealing with man we see a new method, not replacing any before this point, but a step higher and closer to an intimate relationship being restored between God and man. God, Who owes no one anything, but in Him all things have their existence and by Him ALL things are made, The Lord is the One making covenants and promises with believers.
6. Dispensation of Law- Mosaic Covenant Ex. 19:1-Matt. 1:1-25 
The Dispensation of Law is clearly as vital to the perfect plan of God as the others, and yet the law is most often despised. The Law is rigid and unbending, and this is the narrow picture most have of God. The law though was not the full plan of God, but was as a Tutor “School Master” (Galatians 3:24) to teach man what God is expecting of man. Before we have the “What” (to know) but in the dispensation of Grace, God gives man the “How”(the enablement). (Romans 8:3)
7. Dispensation of Grace- New Testament Covenant
Matt. 28:1-10 Eph:2:8; 4:13; I John 3:2; Rev. 4:1-4
Man is incapable of equaling the balances with the character and nature of Christ without the Holy Ghost. Eph. 3:11; It is God’s Eternal Purpose to have a people that would see from God’s point of view and act, think and be like God’s Son. Gal.4:7; Eph.4:13; Rom.8:17; Heb.2:10; 2Cor. 3:18 “are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord” I Pt. 5:10; God has given man Grace—God’s Riches At Christ’s Expense—to do the work in man. God is working the change in man by his grace, and if man should fall, by God’s grace he can have peace with God restored through faith. (Romans 5:1)
8. Dispensation of Righteousness - Kingdom Covenant Rev. 22:1-21
Here is where the final purpose in the plan of God is fulfilled, where righteousness reigns in man and not sin. God is going to work a complete work in us. The New Heaven and New Earth is only the backdrop to the goal and heart of God—fellowship completely restored. God is a holy God and cannot and will not fellowship with sin, but God in his infinite love and knowledge has made a way for us to enter into a place of unrestricted communion with Him separate from sin.

The Seven Tests of the Dispensations 
Test - Failure - Judgment
1. The First dispensation,( Gen.1:1-3:24) of innocence was with one specific test; do not touch the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
a. 1:28- Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion--- Rule over all creatures and the earth. b. 1:29 “every herb bearing seed… to you it shall be for meat”. c. 2:15 God put Adam in the “garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it”. d. 2:16 Man may eat of all trees in the Garden - (but one). e. 2:17 Man MUST NOT eat of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil. f. 2:24-25 Man and wife must work together as one. 
2. The Second dispensation,( Gen. 4:1-8:19) of Conscience was with the added test to obey your conscience. The specific test which all had to pass was two-fold.
a. Must obey your conscience of right and wrong, good and evil. b. Acceptable blood sacrifices offered by faith for true worship.
3. The Third Dispensation, ( Gen. 8:20-11:32) of Human Government was with the test be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and he failed.
God’s rule demonstrated that mankind would not obey God on a threefold basis
a. The human conscience
b. Restraint of lawlessness by the Holy Ghost striving against sin.
1. Abraham’s prayer and witnessing
2. God’s Judgment on sinful people and cities
c. Human government, man would not be able to judge himself properly..

4. The fourth dispensation, (Gen. 12:1- 18:27) of Promise is with a test to believe for the Promised Son.
God’s special dealing with Abraham is made evident in Gal.3:15-22; Heb.6:13-15 
A principle is a ruling factor if it makes a difference in the way people live. 
God intended His promises to Abraham and his seed to make a difference in the way that they would live. 
Hebrews 11:8-30 demonstrates the fact that God’s promises did make a difference in the lives of Abraham and his seed.
a. The human conscience
b. The restraint of lawlessness through the Holy Ghost striving once again against sin.
c. Human government
d. Plus the Promises of God to Abraham
The fourth dispensation is distinct from the third by adding the promises to Abraham’s conscience.
I. The special revelation God gave to Abraham and his seed in the fourth dispensation is in Genesis 12:2-3; 13:14-17; 15; 17:1-22; 22:16-18. 

1. God made personal promises to Abraham. He would bless him, make
his name great, give him many physical descendants, make him the father of many nations, give him the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession, and bless those who would bless him and curse those who would curse him .
2. God made national promises concerning Israel. He would bring Israel into existence as a nation and make it great, give Israel the land of Canaan forever, and establish the Abrahamic Covenant with the nation as an everlasting covenant.
3.`God also made a universal promise. He would give blessing to all the families of the earth through Abraham’s seed. (Messiah-Redeemer-The Promised Seed)

II. The responsibility of Abraham and his seed in the fourth dispensation was a test to obey God on a fourfold basis of the human conscience,
Abram and his descendants failed the test; they disobeyed God as the result of lapses of faith concerning the fulfillment of His promises. Abram fathered Ishmael through Hagar, because he failed to believe God’s promise to give him a son through Sarah, his wife. Twice he lied concerning his wife. Isaac lied concerning Rebekah, his wife. Jacob was a great deceiver.
The Jews did not return from Egypt to Canaan after the famine of Joseph’s time ended.
They forgot their destiny was related to the promised land of Canaan rather than Egypt.
This failure brought divine judgment to the Jews they have continued to have problems with Ishmael’s descendants. Through time they were subjected to slavery and threatened with extinction in Egypt.

5. The fifth dispensation of Law Ex19:1;Mt.27:56;Mk15:4;Lk.23:49;Jn.19:30 Extended from the giving of the Mosaic Law at Mount Sinai to the death of Jesus Christ on the cross at Mount Calvary and rent veil. 
The fifth dispensation had five ruling factors which God used to governed Israel: 
a. The Human conscience
b. The restraint of lawlessness by the Holy Spirit, 
c. Human government,
d. The Promises of God 
e. plus the Mosaic Law. 
The central core of the Mosaic Law (the ten commandments) was
written on tables of stone. The Law inflicted external penalties upon those who broke its
precepts. The Mosaic Law was a totally external way of God administering His rule over Israel (it should be noted that God gave the Mosaic Law exclusively to Israel, not to the Gentiles—see Romans 2:14 and 9:4). Thus, the Apostle Paul declared that the Mosaic Law functioned as (an external moral restrainer, Galatians 3:23-25).

The special revelation that God gave to Israel for the fifth dispensation is recorded in Exodus 20 through Deuteronomy. It consisted of the Mosaic Law with its 613 commandments. These gave in detail God’s will for the moral, civil, and ceremonial aspects of Israel’s life.
The test would be for them to obey God on a fivefold basis. 
The people of Israel failed the test of the fifth dispensation. 
They broke the Mosaic Law repeatedly Jer. 31:32; Ez 16. God told them that they had a heart of stone (Ezekiel 36:26; Zechariah 7:12). 
This failure brought God’s judgment upon Israel. The nation suffered many judgments during the fifth dispensation. Among the worst were the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities, the Greek and Roman oppressions, Israel’s temporary removal from its place of blessing (Romans 11), and its worldwide dispersion as the result of its rejection of Christ. Ex 19:1-8; 2K 17:1-18; 25:1-11; Ac 2:22-23;7:51-52; Ro3:19-20;10:5; Gal3:10







The Usage Of The Word For Dispensation In The New Testament
The word oikonomia appears nine times in the New Testament. In six of these appearances (Luke 16:2-4; 1 Corinthians 9:17; Ephesians 3:2; Colossians 1:25) it is translated stewardship or dispensation and refers to a responsible office or ministry entrusted to one’s care by a higher authority. In the other three appearances (Ephesians 1:10; 3:9; 1 Timothy 1:4) it is translated dispensation, fellowship, and edifying in the King James Version and administration in the New American Standard Bible. In these three passages it refers to a particular way of God administering His rule over the world. Ephesians 1:10 is of special interest, because it appears to refer to the particular way that God will administer His rule over the world in the future Millennium (the Millennial Dispensation). Ephesians 3:9 and 1 Timothy 1:4 refer to the particular way that God administers His rule now (the present dispensation).
A Definition Of The Term Dispensation As It Relates To Dispensational Theology
In light of the usage of the word for dispensation in the New Testament, the term dispensation as it relates to Dispensational Theology could be defined as follows: a dispensation is a particular way of God administering His rule over the world as He progressively works out His purpose for world history.
Essential Characteristics Of Each Dispensation
In order for each dispensation to be distinct from all other dispensations, it must have three essential characteristics. First, it must have a particular way of God administering His rule. Each dispensation is characterized by a unique ruling factor or combination of ruling factors. Second, it must involve a particular responsibility for man. Each dispensation makes mankind responsible to obey God in accordance with the dispensation’s unique ruling factor or combination of factors. Third, it must be characterized by divine revelation which had not been given before. In order for mankind to know God’s new way of ruling and the new responsibility, mankind must have these things revealed to it. Thus, each new dispensation requires new revelation from God 
The Apostle Paul indicated that the present dispensation is definitely related to new revelation which God gave to the apostles and New Testament prophets (Ephesians 3:2-10).
Secondary Characteristics Of Each Dispensation
The fact that each new dispensation involves a newly revealed responsibility for mankind indicates that each dispensation also has three secondary characteristics. First, each dispensation applies a test to mankind. The nature of the test is whether or not mankind will perfectly obey God’s rule by fulfilling the responsibility which is characteristic of that dispensation. Second, each dispensation demonstrates the failure of mankind to obey the particular rule of God which characterizes that dispensation. Third, each dispensation involves divine judgment because of mankind’s failure

Neh. 9:6 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
Col 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

Job 38:6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 
7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
