VI. Dispensation of Grace

From Pentecost to the Second Coming of Christ

Romans 6:14—For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
2Cor. 6:1—We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. 2—(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)

From the Sacrificial death of Jesus Christ (the Crucifixion) to the work of Righteousness in the Day of the Lord.
From The indwelling of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost To The Second Coming Of Christ (the literal coming not the Secret coming in the air)

The Sixth Dispensation is The Dispensation of Grace- The New Testament Covenant
Matt. 28:1-10 Eph:2:8; 4:13; I John 3:2; Rev. 4:1-4

I. The Resurrection and Ascension of Christ

1. Having tasted death for every man. Heb. 2:9

2. On the third day rose again. Acts 10:40

3. God sent an Angel to roll away the stone to reveal the empty tomb.

4. During the forty days after His Resurrection He showed himself alive. Acts 1:3

The Day of Grace began the day Jesus Christ arose from the dead and He showed Himself alive by many infallible proofs. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is well documented for the entire world to know. (Acts 1:3; 2:30; Matt. 28:2,6; Mark 16:9; Luke 24:1-3; Acts 2:30; Romans 1:3; 1Cor. 15:3:1Peter 1:3)
The ultimate sin of Israel was the crucifixion of their Messiah and King under the leadership of the religious leaders of that day and yet His death wrought their salvation.
The Dispensation of Law ended in Judgment. God’s Judgment fell upon the nation in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman armies under Titus A.D.70. History records that over a million Jews perished at this time and the nation was scattered among the kingdoms of the earth in fulfillment of the warning given through Moses. 

Deuteronomy 28:25—The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. 

I. The Influence of God’s Grace

A. The Saving of the Lost Luke 19:10
1. Grace is God’s “Kindness toward us through Jesus Christ.” (Eph. 2:7)
2. GOD”S GRACE deserves all Glorious Praise. (Eph 1:6)
1. By the giving of the LAW, God's justice and holiness were rendered Glorious;
2. By the giving of the GOSPEL, His Grace and Mercy are abundantly Glorious.
Titus 3:3-6—For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, 5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 

A. The Building of God’s Church Mat.16:18
The Day of Grace includes the Day of Pentecost. Joel 2:23-32; Acts 2:17-21;Acts 4:8,10; 10:40,44,45. Also, included is God’s work through the Apostles. Eph.3:2-12; Matthew 10:2-4; Romans 1:1,5

A. The Bride of Christ
Justified→Sanctified→Glorified. A promise left for the dispensation of the fullness of time. We are Responsible for the truth and are to walk in the light that we have. The Absolute Greatest Test of all is the process to becoming the Bride of Christ.

Rev. 19:7,8—Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. 8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. 
Luke 12:36—… men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; …
Gen. 24:58—… Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
Ruth 3:3,4—… he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
Esther 2:15—… she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
Song 1:4—Draw me, we will run after thee… (5:7;7:10)
Psalm 45:9,11,13,14—… upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir… 
1Peter 1: 3-5—…To an inheritance …ready to be revealed in the last time.

Man is incapable of equaling the balances with the character and nature of Christ without the Holy Ghost. Eph. 3:11; It is God’s Eternal Purpose to have a people that would see from God’s point of view and act, think and be like God’s Son. Gal.4:7; Eph.4:13; Rom.8:17; Heb.2:10; 2 Cor. 3:18.
I Pt. 5:10; God has given man Grace—God’s Riches At Christ’s Expense—to do the work in man. God is working the change in man by his grace, and if man should fall, by God’s grace he can have peace with God restored through faith. (Romans 5:1)

A. The Rapture
Luke 12:35-38 Oil constitutes having a burning light, light is type of the Spirit. The church will be caught away in the middle of the week, when christ returns secretly in the air. (I Thessalonians 4:13-18)

A. The Tribulation
After the Church is taken out… 2Th 2:7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. (the Holy Spirit will only leave in the manner that he came in the New Testament, but he will be as he was in the Old Testament, he will come upon them but not in them). Tribulation is necessary for the Church becausethe church has become worldly and rich but spiritually poor and lukewarm (sickening to the Lord). 

The first three and a half years of the Tribulation will be persecution. The first three and half years of tribulation. Mt 24:15 Dan. 12:11; Rev. 12:6; Dan. 12:7 Jer 30:7; Micah 5:3,4;1Thess. 4:16;17 

In the last three and a half years of the tribulation hour the judgment and wrath of God will be poured out.The testing under grace will be with Judgment
Luke 17:26-30—v. 30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
Luke 18:8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? (2Thess. 2:7 – 12; Rev. 3:15, 16)
"the great tribulation." Zeph. 1:15-18; Mat.24:21-22; Rev.7:14

I. The Right Response to God’s Grace

A. Grace is to be continued in.
Acts 13:43—… continue in the grace of God. (Romans 6:1)

A. Grace is to be Testified
Acts 20:24—…to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

A. Grace IS TO GROW UP IN
Acts 20:32—… his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance…
2Peter 3:18—But grow in grace, … (Ephesians 4:15; 1Cor. 15:49; 3:18; 4:11; Php. 3:21)

A. The Day of God's Grace and Longsuffering continues with faith and Love.
Rom.2:4; 9:23; 2Cor. 8:7; Eph.2:4; 3:2; I Tim. 1:14; 2Peter 3:9,15

A. The Day of God's Grace and Longsuffering does not last forever
Rom.1:18; 2:2-16; 9:22; 14:12; 2Cor. 5:10; 2Peter 3:10



I. The Spirit of Grace 

Zech. 12:10-14—v.10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.

A. A Great Blessing - 
vs. 10 "I will pour upon the house of David...the Spirit of grace and of supplications"
1. An Act of God - "I will pour" Implies abundance - Joel 2:28 2. Results of The Outpouring -
(1) To the sinner - John 16:8-11
a. "The Spirit of grace" Leads to salvation – 
b. "The Spirit of supplications" Leads to repentance and prayer–
(2) To the Believer - John 16:13-15

A. A Great Revelation - vs. 10 "they shall look upon me whom they have pierced"
Almost 2,000 years ago, they despised and rejected Him - they said, "we will not have this man to reign over us." They cried for His crucifixion.
1. They shall look to Him - "In that day" - The day He returns.
Acts 1:11 "This same Jesus." He shall appear bearing the marks of the Cross in His hands. Zech.13:6 "And one shall say unto Him, What are these wounds in thine hands." These wounds are the marks of His identity -He still bears those wounds - John 20:20 The wounds will remain through all eternity - as a witness to His triumphant resurrection over death.
2. To look implies three things: (1) Revelation - Psa. 34:5 (2) Salvation - Isa. 45:22 (3) Faith - Heb. 12:2.

A. A Great Revival - vs. 10-12


1. Their mourning compared to two things –(1) The loss of an only son (2) The loss of a firstborn son.
Their blindness and unbelief have been great; now they have discovered their awful guilt in crucifying their long looked for Messiah.

2. The mourning will be universal - "Every family apart"
(1) First the royal family - "The family of the house of David" Nathan - the son of David
(2) Next the Priest-hood - "The family of the house of Levi" Shimei - son of a Levite
(3) Next the rest of the people - vs. 14
"All the families that remain" No one is exempted. The royal - the peasant - the rich - the poor - the great - the small. They must all repent.In every house there will be tears of repentance and confession. Also in every house there will be a well of new-found joy springing up in their hearts. Their long looked for Messiah has come, and brought salvation and deliverance.
