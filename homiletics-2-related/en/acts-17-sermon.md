Ac 17:22–31

22b Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. 
23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. 

24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; 
25 Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; 

26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; 
27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: 
28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. 

29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device. 
30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: 
31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.


Paul tries to make connections with what the people already believe:

* He begins by talking about their altar
* He quotes their authors

He believes they are too religious---they have a lot of religious ceremony, but no real knowledge of God. Paul wants to show them that they can know God personally.
