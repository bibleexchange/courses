Example: Adam is a type of the mystical body of Christ, which is the church. Eve is a type of the bride. Now most commentaries will tell you that Eve is a type of church. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I Corinthians 10:1-11</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Israel in Egypt is the type of being in the bondage of sin; Moses is a type of Christ as the deliverer; </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Israel was delivered by blood and that is the only deliverance that could be, without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Passover lamp is a type of Christ as the lamp of God slain for sinner&rsquo;s sakes</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Pharaoh going after Israel is a type of demonic activity going after you, after you have left Egypt. Remember the devil does not want to let go, he wants to bring you back into bondage. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Water coming out of the rock, is a type of Christ as the living water. Christ was only smitten once. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Cannon is an often misunderstood type. Cannon is often referred to as heaven. Yet Cannon is a type of the fullness of the Christian life, and passing over the river Jordan, which is death to self. In Cannon there is still a struggle, there is not struggle in heaven</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">I Timothy 6:12 If we are going to enter into the fullness we are going to have to fight, fight like we have never fought before.

When you are obeying the will of God you are with the authority of God. If you or I reject or refuse the will of God, you must realize that that will be the very thing that will destroy you. And God says you go and get it by the tail. From than on it was never called Moses&rsquo; rod again it was called the rod of God. If you do the will of God it will become the authority of God. The authority of God is always the instrument of a manifestation of the power of God. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After Moses said stand still and see the deliverance of the Lord, and the very next verse the Lord says go forth. God said hold out the rod and the see departed. The Lord will give us all power of the power of the devil. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When Moses&rsquo; hands went down, the victory would go to the enemy but it was not just his hands, Moses was holding the rod of God. Moses used the rod of God to smite the rock and produce the water out of the rock. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The brazen serpent is a type of Christ. When Christ was lifted up he took upon him our sins, and he became that sin and was crucified. Look and Live;</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The alter in the tabernacle is a symbol prayer, that incense rising. All the time praying, that continual communication, have an open communication. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">No other book has ever based its authenticity on prophecy like the Bible; it is so precise. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Jews of this generation, have turned aside all the other books, and just accepted only the first five books of the Bible. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

The triunity; </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When William Branium said &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord&rdquo;, it was really with power, it was really &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Billy Graham as far as the simple Gospel has touched a lot of people, I don&rsquo;t agree with a lot of the things he has done recently. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
