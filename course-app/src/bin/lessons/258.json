Who or what causes it?  Why doesn't God do something?  Not all questions are answered, but some important points are made.\n\n## Job Curses the Day of His Birth, vs. 1-19\n\nJob wishes he never got a start.\n\n> Job 3:1 ¶ After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 2 And Job spake, and said, 3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. 4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. 5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. 6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. 7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. 8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. 9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 11 ¶ Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? 12 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? 13 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, 14 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; 15 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 16 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. 17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. 18 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. 19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.\n\n### Job cursed not God but he did curse the day he was conceived and the day he was born.\n\n> Job 10:18,19 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.\n\n### Job Has Alot to Learn\n\n- To Teach What is Best\n\n> Ps 69:30-33 … This also shall please the LORD better…\n\n- To Teach Us that Only God Can Do Everything Right\n\n> Job 42:2 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.                          \n\n> II Cor. 6:16 God will dwell and walk in us\n\n- To Teach Us How to Obey in All Things.\n\n> Hebrews 5:8, 9 … yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;\n> 2 Cor. 2:9 … know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.\n> 2 Cor. 10:5, 6 … into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; \n> Hebrews 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; …\n\n## Job Longs for Death, vs. 20-24\n\nJob wishes for an end.\n\n> 20 ¶ Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; 21 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; 22 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? 23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? 24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.\n\n## Job Experiences His Fear Coming to Life, vs. 25-26\n\n> Job 3:25&mdash;For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. 26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.\n\n- Isaiah 35:4\n- John 14:27\n- Joshua 1:9\n- Matthew 6:34\n- Isaiah 43:1\n- Psalm 23:4\n- Psalm 34:4\n- Psalm 94:19\n- Romans 8:38-39\n- Psalm 27:1\n- 1 Peter 5:6-7\n- Psalm 118:6\n- 2 Timothy 1:7\n- Psalm 115:11\n- Psalm 103:17\n- Psalm 112:1\n- Deuteronomy 31:6\n- Psalm 56:3-4\n\n                                                                                        \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n============================================\n                                    \n# Chapter 4: Eliphaz’s Answer to Job\n\nJob 4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,\n\nJob 42:7 And it was so… the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite,  \nWhen they got going Job wished they never started.   2:12-13   13:5\n(it should be your wisdom just to be silent in times like this)\n\nWhat did Eliphaz answer?\nJob’s need?
