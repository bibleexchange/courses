It shall be reserved altogether for holy purposes.\n- Neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it--i.e., after the recipe given -- no secular employment\n\nWhat about Aaron?\n\n- Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured,.... That is, not upon common men, or on men's flesh in common, as was usual at feasts and entertainments in the eastern countries, see Psalm 23:5 but this was not to be used on such occasions, otherwise it was poured on the flesh of some men, as Aaron and his sons, on whose head it was poured and ran down to the beard: \n\n- James 5:13,14\n- 1 John 2:27; John 14:26; 1 Thessalonians 4:9\n- 2 Corinthians 1:21\n\n# Holy Incense, Exodus 30:34-38\n\n34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:\n35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:\n36 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.\n37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.\n38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.\n\n\n> Song of Solomon 1:3 1 &mdash;\n\n<!-- -->\n\n> Exodus 7:1 &mdash;\n\n-  A confection after the art of the apothecary ( in the manner they beat, compound, and mix several ingredients together: ). Like the holy oil, the incense was to be artistically compounded by one accustomed to deal with such ingredients. It was actually, in the first instance, the work of Bezaleel (Exodus 27:29).\n\n- in all sacrifices salt was used, and every spiritual sacrifice of ours should be seasoned with grace: (Colossians 4:6)\n\n# Craftsmen Called to Make, Exodus 31:1-11\n\n# Sabbaths, Exodus 31:13-17\n\n# Tables of Stone & Communicating God's Will, Exodus 31:18; 32; 33; 34; 35:1-19\n\n# The People Giving, Exodus 35:20-29\n\n# Bezaleel and Aholiab, Exodus 35:30-35; 36; 37; 38; 39\n\n# First Time the Tabernacle is Set Up, Exodus 40:1-33\n \n# Glory of the Lord Filled the Tabernacle, Exodus 40:34-38"}
