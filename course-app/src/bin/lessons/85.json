The Holy Ghost quickens the mortal body of those He dwells in. The mortal body that is subject to death is made alive by the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nChrist in us and His life and Righteousness abounding in us is evidence of our faith and of Christ&apos;s works within us.\r\n\r\nQuicken - vitalize - bring to life &mdash; make alive\r\n\r\nA. The Spirit gives life by freeing the believer from sin and death.\r\nB. The Spirit gives life by doing what the law could not do.\r\nC. The Spirit gives life by condemning sin in the flesh.\r\nD. The Spirit gives life by Christ providing Righteousness for us.\r\n\r\n#### Because I am Alive, I Work 8:12-13\r\n\r\n> Romans 8:12-13&mdash;12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. 13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.\r\n\r\n\"THERE FOR\" Christ's Work + Holy Ghost's Work = I am alive and a debtor to God.\r\n\r\nWe are debtors to life - we are obligated and behold to the Holy Ghost and not to the flesh\r\n\r\n### Review of Verses 10-13 \"I Have Received a New Work\"\r\n\r\n> Romans 8:15&mdash;For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\r\n\r\nHaving Received the Spirit of Adoption, I have Received a New Work. We can see the importance of works of righteousness in verses 10 through 13.\r\n\r\n- Because of Christ's Work, I have Life v.10\r\n- Because of the The Holy Ghost&apos;s Work, I am Alive v.11\r\n- Because I am Alive, I Work vs.12-13\r\n\r\n### Having Received the Spirit of Adoption, I have Been Received into a new Family vs. 14-16\r\n\r\n> Romans 8:14-16&mdash;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:\r\n\r\n#### Born Into The Family of God\r\n\r\n##### We are a Part of Something Great\r\n\r\nFamily - Household - Body - Husbandry/Field - Building - Church - Flock - Citizens\r\n\r\n> Ephesians 2:19-22&mdash;Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Galatians 6:10 &mdash;As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Romans 12:5&mdash;So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> 1 Corinthians 3:9&mdash;For we are labourers together with God: ye are God&apos;s husbandry, ye are God&apos;s building.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> 1 Timothy 5:1-4&mdash;Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; 2 The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity. 3 Honour widows that are widows indeed. 4 But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> 1 Timothy 3:15&mdash;But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Hebrews 2:11&mdash;For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,\r\n\r\n##### Are we all God's children?\r\n\r\n> We are all different. Yet we are all God's children. We are all united behind this country and the common cause of freedom, justice, fairness, and equality. That is what unites us. &mdash;Barbara Boxer\r\n\r\n> The Son of God became incarnate in the souls of men to instill the feeling of brotherhood. All are brothers and all children of God.&mdash; Pope Francis\r\n\r\n> I cannot think that we are useless or God would not have created us. There is one God looking down on us all. We are all the children of one God. The sun, the darkness, the winds are all listening to what we have to say. &mdash;Geronimo\r\n\r\n> We are all children of the same God, and we have to come together to solve our problems and not be fighting so much. &mdash;Ann Romney\r\n\r\n> Given that sexual orientation is innate and that we are all, in theological terms, children of God, to deny access to some sacraments based on sexuality is as wrong as denying access to some sacraments based on race or gender. &mdash;Jon Meacham\r\n\r\n(Colossians 1:16 All people are God's creation, but only those born again are God's children. John 1:12,13; Galatians 3:26)\r\n\r\n> Think of what you are, you Christians. You are God's children; you are joint heirs with Christ. The 'many mansions' are for you; the palms and harps of the glorified are for you. You have a share in all that Christ has and is and shall be. &mdash;Charles Spurgeon\r\n\r\n\r\n#### The Spirit Gives Guidance v. 14\r\n\r\n> 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. \r\n\r\n##### Led into Purity\r\n\r\nThe only way to become pure within is to follow Christ. (Read 2 Corinthians 6)\r\n\r\n> 2 Corinthians 6:1&mdash; We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.\r\n\r\nWho I am in the eyes of God is dependant on what Christ has done for me. We use what He gives us to become what He has called us to be.\r\n\r\n#### Led into a Perfect Walk\r\n\r\nA Believer that is half in and half out is the product of the flesh and not allowing the Spirit of God to lead.\r\n\r\n##### Jehoshaphat\r\n\r\nWe can learn alot from Jehoshaphat in 2 Chronicles 20.\r\n\r\n> 2 Chronicles 20:3-4&mdash;And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. 4 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the Lord: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe King prayed and all Judah stood before the Lord.\r\n\r\n> 2 Chronicles 20:13&mdash;And all Judah stood before the Lord, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit of God came upon Jahaziel and he spoke to Judah.\r\n\r\n> 2 Chronicles 20:15&mdash;And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God&apos;s.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> 2 Chronicles 20:26&mdash; And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.*n11\r\n\r\nBerachah is the \"Valley of Blessings (\"blessing\" is \"Berakhah\" in Hebrew).\r\n\r\n> 2 Chronicles 20:32-33&mdash; And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord. 33 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.\r\n\r\nJehoshaphat joined himself in league with a sinner.\r\n\r\n> 35 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 36 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion&mdash;geber. 37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the Lord hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish. \r\n\r\n##### Jesus\r\n\r\n> Hebrews 10:7&mdash;Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.\r\n\r\nJohn 14:31; 12:49; Matthew 21:4; Philippians 2:8; Matthew 12:50\r\n\r\nTo lead people without Godly guidance is to lead them astray. Living out our faith in obedience to Christ will lead others to life!\r\n\r\nI must allow God to help me with my problems so that I may help others.\r\n\r\n#### The Spirit Gives Adoption vs. 15\r\n\r\nThe change Christ works in me glorifies God. The glory the Believer receives is the glory of God revelated in us.\r\n\r\n> \"Our very life is a gift from God to us! How I use it my gift to God.\" -- Sister Cummings\r\n\r\nAs our Father, He leads us many ways. His very leading causes us to mature.\r\n\r\nHow would you know if you were out of the will of God?\r\n\r\nGod speaks to us in so many ways. STILL,SMALL VOICE, GENTLE, KIND and STRONG, REBUKE.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit of God gives Adoption -- growth as a leagal son -- fully mature.\r\n\r\n#### The Spirit Gives Witness v. 16\r\n\r\nBears Witness to Us (of us) and to others."}
