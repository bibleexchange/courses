And they spoiled the Egyptians. 37 ¶ And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. 38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. 39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.\r\n\r\nGod provided the materials to Israel by preparing the hearts of the Egyptians through His mighty hand that the Israelites may in turn have something to offer unto the Lord's service.\r\n\r\n## What is the Difference between Tithes and Offerings?\r\n\r\n> Malachi 3:7-11 &mdash; Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? 8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. 10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. 11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.\r\n\r\n### The Tithe is a TENTH of our increase which is regulated by God in Scripture. (Malachi 3:1-18; \r\n\r\n04643. ma`aser a tenth; especially a tithe:-- tenth (part), tithe(-ing). \r\n\r\nThe Tithe is a test in OBEDIENCE (the will).\r\n\r\n### The Free Will Offering is Determined by the heart of the individual. (Regulated by God but a completely voluntary amount ABOVE the tithe)\r\n\r\n08641. trumah (Deut. 12:11) a present (as offered up), especially in sacrifice or as tribute:-- gift, heave offering ((shoulder)), oblation \r\n\r\n> Leviticus 23:33-38 &mdash; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 34 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD. 35 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. 36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein. 37 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: 38 **Beside** the sabbaths of the LORD, and **beside** your gifts, and **beside** all your vows, and **beside** all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.\r\n\r\nThe Free Will Offering is a test in Commitment/Devotion/Loyalty (the heart).\r\n\r\n> Deuteronomy 12:11 &mdash; Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:\r\n\r\n\"YOUR CHOICE VOWS\" - \"Your select or chosen vows.\" -- pulipit commentary \"The vow was purely voluntary; it became obligatory only after it was made.\"\r\n\r\n## What Regulations Govern the Free-Will Offerings?\r\n\r\n### Voluntary Offering on a Voluntary Occassion\r\n\r\n> Deuteronomy 16:10 &mdash; And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:\r\n\r\nIt was both appropriate to be given on Feast Days or any time. Even the priests were allowed to eat of the free-will offering of their choosing on the day of the offering or the next (Leviticus 7:16–18).\r\n\r\n> Leviticus 7:16-18 &mdash; \r\n\r\n### Voluntary but with God Still Leading\r\n\r\nThe free will offering was to be given freely, as the Lord moved the Israelites’ hearts. -- When the Spirit leads.\r\n\r\n> Exodus 35:29 &mdash; The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.\r\n\r\n### Though Voluntary, Still Must be My Best\r\n\r\n> Leviticus 22:21 &mdash; And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. 22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD. 23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. 24 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land. 25 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Choice Vows\" is brought my choicest gift.\r\n\r\nMalachi 1:14 &mdash; But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.\r\n\r\n### Voluntary and for the Right Reasons\r\n\r\nThe Reason for the Gift Matters as Does the Quality of the Gift\r\n\r\n> Amos 4:5 &mdash; And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be used to gain prestige or because of guilt, inducement, or force. \r\n\r\n### Voluntarily and Cheerfully\r\n\r\n> 2 Corinthians 9:7 &mdash; Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\r\n\r\n### Voluntary with a Variety of Options\r\n\r\nFree will offerings did not always have to be animals or grain or drink offerings. \r\n\r\n- In Exodus 25 & 35, God had given instructions on how to build the tabernacle, and Moses relayed what supplies were needed for its construction. The people responded as their hearts stirred them, bringing jewelry, fine yarn, tanned skins, silver, bronze, acacia wood, onyx stones, spices, and oil. \r\n- Centuries later, the people made similar offerings for David to pass on to Solomon to build the temple (1 Chronicles 9:1–9). \r\n- In the book of Ezra, the people gave traditional animal offerings (Ezra 3:5) as well as supplies to rebuild the temple after the Babylonian captivity (Ezra 2:68; 7:16; 8:28). \r\n- The people also made animal offerings in 2 Chronicles 31 when King Hezekiah, one of Judah’s best kings, led the nation in returning to God and reinstituting His ceremonies. \r\n- In Ezekiel 46:12, the prince shall prepare free will offering.\r\n\r\n> Ezekiel 46:12 &mdash; Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.\r\n\r\n## What Does God Want from Me?\r\n\r\nJustice demands thy punishment; Mercy pleads for thy life. Mercy Triumphs over Judgment! \r\n\r\n> Hosea 11:8 ¶ How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> 2 Kings 10:15 &mdash; And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, **Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?** And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. \r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> Proverbs 23:26 &mdash; My son, **give me thine heart**, and let thine eyes observe my ways.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> Jer 24:7 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with **their whole heart**.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> Jeremiah 32:39 And I will give them **one heart**, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
