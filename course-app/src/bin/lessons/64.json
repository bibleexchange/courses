Just as writing a verse out can help in memorizing it, so speaking the words aloud is an excellent way to burn them into your memory. One person suggested turning the radio off during your commute to work or school each day and reciting your memory verse out loud instead!\r\n\r\n> [Romans 1:16,17] <br>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: <br>for it is the power of God unto salvation <br>to every one that believeth; <br>to the Jew first, <br>and also to the Greek. <br>17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed <br>from faith to faith: <br>as it is written, <br>The just shall live by faith.\r\n"}
