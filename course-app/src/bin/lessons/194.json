The prologue is divided into two sections; the first deals with Christ revealed as the Word (vs. 1-14) and the second deals with Christ proclaimed by John the Baptist (vs. 15-18). These first 18 verses are mainly a presentation of the Person of Christ with the first fourteen verses on how He is seen through the eyes of the writer, John the beloved, and the last four verses on how He is seen through the eyes of John the Baptist.</p>\r\n<h3>Christ Reveled as the Word 1:1-14</h3>\r\n<p>This term, the Word, is mentioned four times in two verses&mdash;three times in verse one and once in verse 14. In the Greek it is the word Logos (Strong's Number 3056), which means \"something said; speech; talk; tidings; treatise; utterance.\" Logos is not only used in contexts meaning natural speech, but in some situations (i.e. here in John 1:1-2) it means the Divine Expression or the uttered mind of God and is referring to Christ, who is the person of the godhead that communicates with man and reveals who God is (John 1:18; Luke 10:22). This reference of Christ as the Word is an idiom (an expression whose meaning is not predictable from the general grammatical rules of the language) and is peculiar to the writings of John (1 John 1:1, 5:7; Rev. 19:13).</p>\r\n<h4>The Word and Deity 1:1-2</h4>\r\n<blockquote>In the beginning was the Word&hellip;</blockquote>\r\n<p>This is speaking of the Son of God or Christ, and not Jesus, which is the name given to the Son of God when he took on humanity. The Word (the divine Son of God) had existence in the fullness of His glory before the world was created. (Ps. 90:2; Dan. 7:9,13,22; John 6:62; 8:58; 16:28; 17:5; 17:24; I Pet. 1:20; Rev. 13:8)</p>\r\n<p>In this verse we see a distinction made between the Father (God) and the Son (the Word) by the phrase &quot;the Word was with God,&quot; while at the same time it is not denying Christ's divinity but rather affirms it in the next phrase &quot;and the Word was God.&quot; Christ is a part of the godhead, but He is not the entirety of the godhead and He is not an inferior being or creature but equal with the Father called by the same name, same attributes, performs same works, same honor, and they are the same in substance, which is their power and glory.</p>\r\n<h4>The Word and Creation 1:3</h4>\r\n<p>Christ was not only existent at the time of Creation, but He was also active in the works of creation (Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:16). Genesis 1:1 uses the plural noun Elohim (translated God) because it is referring to not only the Father, but also the Son and the Spirit, who both shared in the work of creation (notice the use of the pronouns us and our in Genesis 1:26). When it says, &quot;all things were made by Him,&quot; it does not refer only to every material object of the universe, but also the system of laws that govern those objects.</p>\r\n<h4>The Word and Life 1:4-9</h4>\r\n<p>Christ (the Word) not only created all things, but He is the one that gives a living soul to mankind. Adam's physical body was first created, but it was not until God breathed into him that he became a living soul that could have fellowship with God (Gen. 2:7; Job 33:4). When Adam sinned, his physical body did not instantly die, but his spiritual soul did. It is Christ that restores this spiritual life to mankind and &quot;enlightens&quot; his soul.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;The life is the light of men.&quot; Light is used as a symbol for life throughout scripture (Ps. 18:28; Prov. 24:20; John 8:12) and it also refers to righteousness (John 3:19-20; 12:35) and a revelation of knowledge (II Cor. 4:6). When Christ comes into a man's life He transforms a soul that is dark with sin into a new, living creature that is full of righteousness and knowledge of God.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.&quot; Christ's appearance into the world brought the opportunity for light to shine in the souls of every man, but not every man would receive it &quot;because their deeds were evil&quot; (John 3:19). They were not able to extinguish the light or even make it go dim, but they could refuse it, and they did.</p>\r\n<h4>The Word and the World 1:10</h4>\r\n<p>The English word &quot;world&quot; is used 70 times in the Gospel of John in the KJV and it is used to describe both the physical and spiritual environments that man inhabits.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The Word present in the world &mdash; &quot;He was in the world&quot;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The Word active in the world &mdash; &quot;The world was made by Him&quot;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The Word was ignored by the world&mdash; &quot;The world knew Him not&quot;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>The Word and Men 1:11-13</h4>\r\n<p>When Christ came into the world as the long-awaited Messiah he did not receive the warm welcome from the Jewish people as we might have expected, but rather &quot;His own received Him not&quot; (i.e. Matt. 21:33-46; 26:3-4; Luke 4:28-29). While His own people as a whole did not receive Him, there were some Jews that did accept Him as well as some people from other nationalities such as Samaritans (John 4) and Greeks (John 12:20-21) that did believe on Him.</p>\r\n<h4>The Word and Incarnation 1:14</h4>\r\n<p>Incarnation is the act of a living being embodying a deity or spirit, and it is thus Christ taking on the form of a man and being born in that lowly stable in Bethlehem. While the Nativity accounts in Matthew and Luke deal with it from earth looking up to Heaven, the account here in John deals with it from Heaven looking down to earth; Matthew and Luke look at it more from a natural perspective while John looks at it entirely spiritual and does not mention His mother, the journey to Bethlehem, or the swaddling clothes. John does not focus on how He became incarnate, but rather on why He became incarnate&mdash;to dwell among men and reveal to them the glory and power of God.</p>\r\n<h4>Christ Proclaimed by John 1:15-18</h4>\r\n<p>In those days just before the coming of the Lord, there was a thundering voice of a prophet heard in the land crying out against religious pretense, against the traditions of men, and against the religion of form that had substituted the true worship of God. This voice was none other than that of John the Baptist, who was sent by God (1:6) to be a forerunner of Christ. John did not proclaim himself or his ideas or religion, but he spoke that which God spoke to Him (Luke 3:2), which was a message of repentance to prepare for the appearance of the Messiah (Matthew 3:1-3). The Baptist's message of uplifting Christ fits well with the account given here in John even more so than the accounts in either Matthew, Mark, or Luke, for here we do not find any record of John's baptism ministry or of his message of repentance, but we only see a heralding of the Messiah&mdash;all his speech revolves around Him.</p>\r\n<p>Though much condensed, the witness that the Baptist gives here in John 1:15-18 is very similar to that already given in verses 1-14.</p>\r\n<table>\r\n\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\r\n\t\t<th>The Idea</th>\r\n\r\n\t\t<th>The Beloved's Testimony</th>\r\n\r\n\t\t<th>The Baptist's Testimony</th>\r\n\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>Christ is preeminent</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>The Word was God 1:1</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>He is preferred before me 1:15</td>\r\n\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>Christ is eternal</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>In the beginning 1:1</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>He was before me 1:15</td>\r\n\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>Christ gives salvation\tTo them gave he power to become the sons of God 1:12</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>To them gave he power to become the sons of God 1:12</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>Of his fullness have all we received 1:16</td>\r\n\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>Christ gives life</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>In him was life 1:4</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>Grace and truth came by Jesus 1:17</td>\r\n\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>Christ is the divine image</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>The Word 1:1</td>\r\n\r\n\t\t<td>The son&hellip;hath declared him 1:18</td>\r\n\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n<h2>The Record of John 1:19-34</h2>\r\n<p>After brief but powerful statements about the deity of Jesus, His pre-existence, and incarnation, John's Gospel now introduces Jesus in person by His introduction and baptism by John the Baptist.</p>\r\n<h3>The Record of Who John Was 1:19-28</h3>\r\n<p>The ministry of John the Baptist was not a quiet, uncontroversial one and so it attracted the attention of the Jews when he rebuked the Pharisees and Sadducees (Matt. 3:7), publicans (Luke 3:12), and even Roman soldiers (Luke 3:14). The religious leaders were amazed at his boldness and sent messengers to find out who in the world he was and why he felt he had the authority to say such things.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Who art thou?&quot; they asked John, but he would not directly answer their question, but rather told them who he was not. He was not concerned what they thought about him, but all his answers pointed to Christ. When he finally did tell them who he was, it was still in relation to Christ&mdash;he was a voice sent to prepare the way of the Lord. It can be said this way, John had this testimony that not even the Priests and Levites knew who John was, but God did&mdash;a man sent from God to bear witness.</p>\r\n<p>When they realized who he was (or more, who he wasn't) they asked him why he then felt he had the right to baptize people (the Jews asked the question concerning baptism, because Jewish people often often emphasized ceremonial methods). John once again bypassed their real question and gave them an answer that related to Christ&mdash;he was doing a small thing (baptizing with water) compared to what Jesus would do (baptize with fire&mdash;see Matt. 3:11).</p>\r\n<h3>The Record of Who Christ Is 1:29-31</h3>\r\n<h4>John Recognized Christ's Purpose 1:29</h4>\r\n<p>The day after this interrogation we see Jesus come to John, at which John made his famous proclamation, &quot;Behold the Lamb of God!&quot; This title reveals that John had prophetic insight from God concerning Christ for he knew that He would be the antitype of the Passover Lamb. He knew that He would not be the political leader for whom the Jews were searching, but rather He would be as a lamb slain for the sins of all humanity, and thus take &quot;away the sins of the world.&quot;</p>\r\n<h4>John Recognized Christ&apos;s Divinity 1:30</h4>\r\n<p>By revelation from God, John knew that Jesus was more than a mere mortal, but he knew that He was preeminent (He that cometh after me is preferred before me) and that He was eternal (for he was before me)&mdash;He was the Son of God robed in human flesh.</p>\r\n<h4>John Recognized Christ's Office 1:31</h4>\r\n<p>John did not know that it was to be his cousin that he was announcing when he started preaching, but he did know that someone would come soon and reveal himself to Israel as the Messiah. John realized and proclaimed that Jesus was indeed the One for whom he had been waiting.</p>\r\n<h3>The Record of Christ's Baptism 1:32-34</h3>\r\n<p>Remember, the key thoughts of the Gospel of John are signs, believing, and life, and here we see those ideas working in the life of John the Baptist. He was not told by God who the Messiah would be by name, but he was told a sign that would reveal who the Messiah would be. This sign was that John would see the Spirit of God descend from Heaven and abide on an individual and that man was to be the One who would baptize with the Holy Ghost.</p>\r\n<p>While we do not see here an account of the actual occurrences of Jesus' baptism, we do see detailed accounts in the other Gospels (i.e. Matt. 4:13-17), which agree with what is said here in the Gospel of John. When John saw the Spirit descending on Jesus &quot;like a dove&quot; he believed that Jesus was the Son of God, who was the source of life for whom John had been seeking.</p>\r\n<h2>The Enlistment of Disciples 1:35-51</h2>\r\n<h3>Andrew 1:35-39</h3>\r\n<p>John the Baptist now knew that Jesus was the Messiah and he also knew that his own ministry was soon coming to a close. The day after Jesus&apos; baptism John was standing with two of his disciples (one we know is Andrew and the other's identity is uncertain), Jesus passed by, and John proclaimed once again, &quot;Behold the Lamb of God!&quot; This was John's message to his disciples that this was the man that he had been talking about and that they should start following Him. The disciples were quick to respond and immediately started following Jesus without any other prodding.</p>\r\n<h3>Simon Peter 1:40-42</h3>\r\n<p>We see Andrew coming out of his encounter with Jesus and hurrying away to find his brother Simon Peter and gave him the message, &quot;We have found the Messiah (the anointed One)&mdash;the Christ!&quot; and then brought him to Jesus. This is what we need to do as Christians&mdash;we have found the Messiah and we need go out with excitement and tell others about Him and compel them to come unto Him.</p>\r\n<h3>Philip 1:43-44</h3>\r\n<p>Jesus travelled to Galilee where He found Philip and compelled him to follow Him. Philip is known in Acts 21:8 as an evangelist, and he held true to that title from the beginning of his discipleship, for soon after encountering Jesus he ran to find Nathanael and tell him about &quot;Him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;</p>\r\n<h3>Nathanael 1:45-51</h3>\r\n<p>Nathanael was not as quick as the other disciples to believe that Jesus was the Messiah. His initial response to Philip's proclamation of the Messiah was one of doubt, &quot;Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?&quot; Matthew Henry says of Nathanael&apos;s response that, &quot;His objection arose from ignorance&hellip;. If he meant that the Messiah, that great good thing, could not come out of Nazareth, so far he was right (Moses, in the law, said that he should come out of Judah, and the prophets had assigned Bethlehem for the place of his nativity); but then he was ignorant of the matter of fact, that this Jesus was born at Bethlehem.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Philip needed to see a sign before he could believe. Jesus gave him such a sign of His omniscience by revealing that He knew about his character and also about his physical location at the time when Philip came to him. These signs led Nathanael to believe and Jesus told him that if he continued to believe that he would &quot;see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.&quot; This speaks to us of the fullness of God's power&mdash;the fullness of life.</p>"}
