It was made out of a talent of pure gold beaten with hammers until it assumed its proper shape. The seven bowls on the tops of the branches were supplied with pure oil which burned continually.\n\n## The Gold\n\nMade with a talent of gold, the Candlestick weighed about 75-110 lbs. and would be worth $1.5 - $2.1 million in gold today.\n\nGold is a type for Divinity. \n\n> Psalm 45:9,13 &mdash; 9 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. 13 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.\n<!-- -->\n> Revelation 3:18 &mdash; I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.\n<!-- -->\n> Job 23:10 &mdash; But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.\n\n## Christ, The True Light\n\n> John 8:12 &mdash; Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\n<!-- -->\n> John 9:5 &mdash; As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\n<!-- -->\n> John 1:9 &mdash; That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\n<!-- -->\n> 2 Corinthians 4:6 &mdash; For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\n\n## The Church, The Light\n\n> Matthew 5:14 &mdash; Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.\n<!---->\n> Ephesians 5:8 &mdash; For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:\n\n- A Relative Picture is Seen in Revelation Chapter 1\n\n> Revelation 1:12 &mdash; And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;\n<!---->\n> Revelation 1:13 &mdash; And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.\n<!---->\n> Revelation 1:20 &mdash; The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.\n\nStudy carefully Revelation 1 and you will find a relative picture with Jesus defining the 7 candlesticks as the seven churches (in Asia).\n\nThese seven churches represent the whole church from Pentecost to the Rapture. In Revelation 1, we have a marvelous picture of the Glorified Christ in the midst of His Church. As High Priest, He is there to trim teh wicks and replenish wih the oil of the Holy Ghost.\n\n## The Holy Spirit\n\nThe Holy Spirit is seen in both oil and the fire.\n\n- oil Luke 4:18; hebrews 1:9; Isaiah 61:3; Psalm 92:10; Psalm 104:15; Matthew 25:3-10\n- fire John 15:26; (Spirit of Truth; Illumination) Acts 2:3\n\n## The Word\n\n> Psalm 119:105, 130 &mdash; 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n> 2 Peter 1:29A &mdash; \n\n## The Light\n\n### A. Only in God is there light. \n\nOnly gold and oil were used in the making of the candlestick. \n\n### B. There was no natural light in the Holy place. \n\nWe cannot see or understand God by natural means. God alone can illuminate our mind and bring revelation of Himself.\n\n> Proverbs 3:5\n> 1 Corinthians 2:14\n\n### C. The High Priest kept the candlestick supplied with oil continually. \n\nWith snuff dishes he removed the burnt matter that the light should shine undimmed. Christ is our Great High Priest who exercises His High Priestly care over His Church. He gives the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He walks in the midst of His Church to replenish with oil, and trim the wicks. The light was always to burn.\n\n> \n\n### D. The Wicks Speak of Humanity\n\nThe wicks set forth our humanity which must be submerged in the oil of the Holy Ghost. Always remember that the precious Hand that is trimming the wick is \"nail scarred\"! The tongs and snuff dishes were of gold aslo, for the whole matter was a direct result of Divine operation. \n\n \n\n"}
