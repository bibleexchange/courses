The Psalms of Confidence are characterised by their attitude of faith, trust and sense of security in God.\r\n\r\n## National Confidence\r\n\r\n(psalms 115, 125, 129)\r\n\r\n### Psalm 115\r\n\r\n1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake. 2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? 3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. 4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: 6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: 7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. 8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. 9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. 14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children. 15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. 16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence. 18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.\r\n\r\n- \"Not Unto Us\" ... \r\n\t\r\n\tTaking credit for God's work? \"there's a danger of idolatry when we make God's work about us instead of Him.\"\r\n\r\n- Useless Idols -- \"the work of men's hands\"\r\n\r\n\tIdolatry in the modern church: 1) Celebrity Ministries 2) Worshipping Worship 3) Still Silver and Gold  4) Objectifyinig God (vs. Personal Experience) 5) Viewing God's Word through an Unfaithful Prism\r\n\r\n> Exodus 20:3 &mdash; Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\r\n\r\n- Psalm 100:3\r\n\r\n> Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.\r\n \r\n- vs. 12 \"The Lord hath been mindful of us: he will bless us;\"\r\n\r\n### Psalm 125\r\n\r\n1 {A Song of degrees.} They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. 2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. 3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. 4 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. 5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.\r\n\r\n- the title: \"A Song of Degrees\"\r\n\r\nThis psalm is a part of a \"Pilgrim's Song Book\" or \"Songs of Degrees or Ascents\". This a title given to fifteen of the Psalms, 120–134, each starting with the ascription Shir Hama'aloth. They are also variously called Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps or Pilgrim Songs. Four of them (122, 124, 131 and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one (127) to Solomon. Psalms of Ascents were sung by pilgrims journeying up to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Psalm 129\r\n\r\n1 {A Song of degrees.} Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: 2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. 3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. 4 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: 7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.\r\n\r\nThe Heathen vs. the Righteous. Essential to the Psalms of Confidence is the belief that God has a people and that he acts as Protector of this convenant People. (Psalm 23; Exodus 14 \"the Exodus\")\r\n\r\n### \"Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus\", Dudley Tyng & George Duffield, Jr.\r\n\r\nGeorge Duffield, Jr. (1818-1888) wrote his hymn, Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus\" out of a tragic accident that resulted in the early death of one of the most stirring preachers in the northeastern United States during the mid-nineteeth-century. \r\n\r\nDudley Tyng (1825-1858), was one of several ministers participating in a great citywide revival that swept Philadelphia in 1858. His strong doctrinal preaching and his anti-slavery messages were popular for some and angered others, resulting in his resignation from the Episcopal church. In addition to serving the newly organized Church of the Covenant, his midday services at the YMCA attracted crowds as large as 5,000. On one occasion, March 30, 1858, 1000 men responded to the message by committing their lives to Christ.\r\n\r\nDuring this sermon, Tyng is said to have declared, \"I would rather that this right arm were amputated at the trunk than that I should come short of my duty to you in delivering God's message.\" Prophetically and tragically, within a few weeks while visiting the countryside, his arm was caught in the cogs of a corn thrasher and severely lacerated resulting in a great loss of blood and an infection that took his life a few days later. Either in his final sermon or on his deathbed, Tyng is to have said, \"Let us stand up for Jesus.\" Another account states that the dying Tyng told his father, a retired Episcopal minister, \"Stand up for Jesus, father, and tell my brethren of the ministry to stand up for Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nDuffield was inspired by the funeral service for Tyng to preach on Ephesians 6:14 in his sermon the following Sunday, the text of which reads, \"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness.\" (KJV) The hymn he wrote was sung at the conclusion of the sermon.\r\n\r\nAn omitted stanza five alludes to Tyng's death in lines 5 and 6:\r\n\r\nStand up!—stand up for Jesus!\r\nEach soldier to his post;\r\nClose up the broken column,\r\nAnd shout through all the host!\r\nMake good the loss so heavy,\r\nIn those that still remain,\r\nAnd prove to all around you\r\nThat death itself is gain!\r\n\r\n## Individual Confidence\r\n\r\n(psalms 3, 4, 11, 16, 23, 27, 62, 121, 131)\r\n\r\n### Psalm 3\r\n\r\n> 1 {A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.} LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me. 2 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah. 3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah. 5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about. 7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. 8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.\r\n\r\n- The Darkest Days of David’s Life (2 Samuel 15:1 &mdash; 19:8)\r\n\r\nDavid had to flee Jerusalem to escape Absolom's conspiracy against him.\r\n\r\n> 2 Samuel 15:13 &mdash; And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. \r\n\r\n- \"No Help for him in God\"\r\n\r\n> 2 Samuel 15:24-29 &mdash; And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. 25 And the king said unto Zadok, **Carry back the ark of God into the city**: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, **he will bring me again**, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 26 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. 27 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, **Art not thou a seer?** return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 28 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. 29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.\r\n\r\nShimei curses David and casts stones 2 Samuel 16:5-8 while proclaiming that David's situation was God's judgment upon David."}
