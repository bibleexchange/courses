It will be world-wide.</p>\r\n<p>Why does God allow it? On account of their apostasy.</p>\r\n<p>God has promised Palestine to the Jews. Palestine is the Land of Promise They are to be brought back and restored. Whole-hearted return to the Lord - Joel 2:23 Zionism is a nationally attempted restoration of Israel. It is a restoration in unbelief. God has something better. The temple and its worship restored.</p>\r\n<h3>The Two Classes &mdash;.Rom. 9:6 Rom. 3:2829</h3>\r\n<p>Seed of Abraham has always been divided into 2 classes:</p>\r\n<h4>·Isaac &mdash;Promise </h4>\r\n<h4>·Ishmael&mdash;Flesh</h4>\r\n<p>In the O.T. the Israelites who turned away from Jehovah and worshipped idols God judged. </p>\r\n<p>A remnant always believed (faith and hope). Ezekiel 9:4Godly remnant Mal. 3. Hope of the orthodox believing Jews has never died. During the tribulation this godly remnant will accept the Christ and suffer for Him.</p>\r\n<p>Jew&apos;s prediction - Matt. 24:14 The abomination of desolation in Israel&apos;s land during the Tribulation. </p>\r\n<p>They bear witness to Christ and His soon coming to judge.&quot;All Israel shall be saved&quot; does not include the idolatrous God-blaspheming part of the nation.&quot; </p>\r\n<p>Ezek. 20:30; 13:89; 12:9-13:1</p>\r\n<h2>X. Israel&apos;s Future Restoration -</a></h2>\r\n<p>The curses and threatenings the dispersion and the sufferings mean literal Israel and have been literally fulfilled. The predictions of the future blessing and glory have not been transferred to the church but will be fulfilled in Israel. Read Deut. 30:1-9. </p>\r\n<h3>Outstanding facts in the above passage:</h3>\r\n<h4>1. The future dispersion is assumed. Not the Babylonian captivity of 70 years nor the captivity of the 10 tribes.
