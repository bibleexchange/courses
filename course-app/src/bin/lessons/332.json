(All this takes place after 38 years of miracles in the wilderness.)\r\n\r\nGod speaks to Moses beginning with a question, \"How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me?\" The Lord also says he will disinherit them and make another greater nation than they.\r\n\r\nMoses intercedes for Israel and prays for mercy.\r\n\r\n> Numbers 14:17-19 &mdash; And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, 18 The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. 19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.\r\n\r\nThe Lord responds with pardon according to Moses' prayer and God would not make another nation. But All those who came out of Egypt and saw the glory of God and his miracles and yet still tempted God over and over, with the exception of Joshua and Caleb, perished without entering the Promised Land and only their Children entered.\r\n\r\n## Our Dwelling Place is the Everlasting God, vs. 1,2\r\n\r\n> Psalm 90:1-2 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. 2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.\r\n\r\n1. The Lord Has Been Our Dwelling Place\r\n\r\n- dwelling place, refuge, home, protector, habitation\r\n\r\n> Psalm 91:1-2 &mdash; He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.\r\n\r\n- During the Plagues of Egypt, God covered Israel. When other nations were being overcome by foreign powers, God preserved Israel and gave them His Word of Hope and Deliverance.\r\n\r\n- Psalm 49:11-17 (contrast with those who trust in wealth.)\r\n\r\n- Maintain a conscious attitude of Heaven as my home.\r\n\r\n2. From Everlasting to Everlasting Thou Art God\r\n\r\n- Time does not Change Him\r\n- No other can overtake Him (not even a golden calf, no matter how much investment is made)\r\n\r\n## Our Days are Passed Away in God's Wrath, vs. 3-11\r\n\r\n> Psalm 90:3-11 &mdash; 3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. 4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.\r\n6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. 7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. 8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told. 10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. 11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.\r\n\r\n- Man is Frail, like a tale told, Vapor, breath (contrasted with God is eternal from vers 2.)\r\n\r\n> James 4:14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.\r\n\r\n- We are to Submit to the Judgments of God as righteous.\r\n- God is NOT \"out to get us\"\r\n- Our Iniquities and secret Sins are before God in \"the light of thy countenance\".\r\n\r\n> Psalm 7:11 &mdash; God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. [written by David]\r\n\r\n- It is probably that Moses penned this prayer for the nation to rehearse daily in their private tents and in the tabernacle service. (As their situaton was clearly pronounced by God that many would not inherit the land but would die in the wilderness.)\r\n\r\n## The Beauty of the Lord Our God May be Upon Us, 12-17\r\n\r\n> Psalm 90:12-17 &mdash; So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. 13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. 14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. 16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. 17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.\r\n\r\n- TEACH US\r\n\r\n\t- We need a teacher!\r\n\t- to live as the people of God\r\n\r\n- HOPE, We can always pray for mercy!\r\n\r\n > 1Ch 29:18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee: \r\n \r\n > 2Ch 30:6 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.\r\n\r\n- THY WORK AND THY GLORY APPEAR\r\n\r\n- PURPOSE\r\n"}
