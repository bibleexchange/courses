We can have a Joy that will rejoice in the Promise rather than react to the problem. Where Christ is working there is Joy. James 1:2 &quot;Count it all joy&quot; 5:10; 4:9</p>\n<h5>Patience</h5> <p>Know that the trial is to work Patience so that we press in, press through and press on. Patience is a sign your faith is working. Patience has its place with Faith and Joy unto Perfection. Where Christ is working there is Patience.</p>\n<blockquote>James 1:3�The trying of your faith worketh patience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>James 1:4�Let patience have her perfect work.</blockquote>\n<h5>Wisdom</h5> <p>Ask for Wisdom and it shall be given. We are given the Unction to speak and act wisely in the hour of trial. Where Christ is working there is wisdom.</p>\n<blockquote>James 1:5�If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God&hellip;</blockquote>\n<h5>Unwavering mind</h5> <p>We need a humble mind that will always depend on the Lord. A faith that refuses to respond to the surging billows of doubt in the hour of trial. Endurance has its place with Faith and Love through every trial. Where Christ is working there is endurance (1:12) with an unwavering mind.</p>\n<blockquote>James 1:6�&hellip;nothing wavering&hellip;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>James 1:8�A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</blockquote>\n<h5>Love</h5> <p>Pure Love never fails to make faith work perfectly. Faith and love are content with God&apos;s dealings in the hour of trial. Where Christ is working there is Love.</p>\n<blockquote>James 1:12�Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>James 1:2�My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</blockquote>\n<h4>There are diverse temptations and trials. 1:2</h4>\n<h5>Faith tried by the Word.

James 1:12</p>\n<h5>Faith Tried by Afflictions, Hardships, Tests, and Trials. Affliction is any condition that produces suffering or pain.</h5>\n<h6>There are two types of affliction:</h6> <p>THE FIRST is designed to judge sin (Isaiah 53:4; Matthew 24:29; Romans 2:9)</p> <p>THE SECOND is designed to purify and perfect the believer (James 1:2-4; 5:13; Rom. 5:3-5; 8:18 II Thess. 1:4-7; Isaiah 48:10; 63:9; Hosea 5:15; II Chron. 33:12; I Peter 5:9,10).</p>\n<h6>In both cases you that are spiritual must be a help to those that are afflicted (James 1:17; Gal. 6:1; I Cor. 2:15).</h6>\n<h6>How to pray in affliction.</h6>\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>INSTRUCTION</td>\n\t\t<td>REFERENCE</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Learn to pray through alone.

Obedience to the word to good conduct unto good character. Perfect faith to perfect conduct unto perfect character</p> <p>Right character should always produce right conduct. The proof of a man&apos;s faith is a manifestation of Christ&apos;s life.</p> "}
