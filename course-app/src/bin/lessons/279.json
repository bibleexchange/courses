Not just feelings or words. Not just what you like, but you have to battle what you feel.\r\n\r\nThere is a true fight and battle that we miss because of how we feel in the flesh.\r\n\r\nEphesians 4:15-16, 23\r\n\r\n**READING**:\r\n\r\n> Eph 4:15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: 16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.\r\n\r\n- Every joint, member is important. Not everyone that is saved is a part of the Body of Christ and also once you are a part off the body you are not eternally secured in that.\r\n- Justification was not meant to remain in your life just as a gift. god's wants us to learn his Word and how to walk in continued obedience to that word. there is more to lean.\r\n- Its not enought to use a a soft tone. Much guile is disguised behind a nice voice. But in genuine love speak the truth.\r\n- Once you can love the preacher and the one beside you, then maybe you can learn to love the person across the aisle.\r\n- Who is the worst person you know? Do you believe God can help you love them? Let God help you.\r\n\r\n> Eph 4:23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;\r\n\r\n## Renewed\r\n\r\nNot the old thinking, but a new thinking\r\n\r\n(Romans 12:2) A transformation will take place when the mind is renewed. God doesn't want you to just say words, but He wants your mind renewed.\r\n\r\nThe more we know of the Lord, the less we realize we know. I want to know Him better and more. The best way to know Him is apply what you do know.\r\n\r\nSpeaking the truth. It isn't just I have a memory verse and so let me speak that memory verse. \r\n\r\nThe Lord will allow you to try to help yourself until you admint \"I can't help myself without God's help.\"\r\n\r\nThe Holy Ghost can speak to you and that will work in you and transform you. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI like the old time way. The Spirit of God comes upon you and you can rest assure that you have received the Word of God.\r\n\r\nIn my experience of being filled with the Holy Ghost, I felt like I was a vessel full of holes. \r\n\r\nAs he renews our mind, those holes are filled up. Our understanding doesn't have to have such big gaps. \r\n\r\n-----\r\nFree from carnal thinking and ways. Being able to say things that sound right and even quoting Scripture is not enough. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJeremiah, \"I'm not gonna tell them anymore because everything I say they reject.\"\r\n----\r\n\r\nWe need a renewed mind and to get there, we need a renewed altar.\r\n\r\nDavid renewed the altar. When Moses was led by the Spirit to make the Tabernacle in the wilderness. \"How to do it God's ways.\" That black badger skin on the outside didn't look pretty to some. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI don't want to know your shape, so one day your husband knows your shape. I'm against pretty, but we need a renewed mind. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo renew an altar, you need an understanding from the Spirit. Moses got the plan for the tabernacle from the mountain. Build it this way. Moses built by revelation of the Spirit.\r\n\r\nDavid renewed the altar. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNo wonder they only get 3 years of use out of their tent cause you install/uninstall the tent from a giant wheel.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLord create in me a clean heart. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThere are so many jobs and needs to be fulfilled. \"It is better to do nothing than to do something wrong.\" \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDon't watch me work. If you aren't going to help me, go. If you aren't gonna help me, I'm leaving is what alot of people say. What does the Spirit of God have for you to do? \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCommotion of knots in my stomach when others are around.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere were times when my brothers hated working with Jimmy and though they would smile at him.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI worked hard and my brothers try to work harder than me. Competing. Sugar pill is not real energy or lasting.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWe need to be a body fitly joined together. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDavid could not build the house of God according to his design and likes, but it had to be according to God's design. \r\n\r\n\r\n1Ch 15:1 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.\r\n\r\n1 Chronicles 16:1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.\r\n \r\n2Ch 1:4 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nGod preserved in His Word power to transform our lives if we receive it by is Spirit.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nSpeak the truth in love, not hate. Overcome nervous and jealous energy. \r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nAre there certain thoughts you have to fight against and deal with in face of the Word of God. \r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n============================\r\n\r\n**The Sin of Imagination**\r\n**The Art of Faith**\r\n\r\nWhat should we do when there's no obvious spiritual directive ? Wait and do nothing? \r\n\r\nAre Christian's required in their pursuit of the holiness of God, to strip all efforts of personal color or influence?\r\n\r\nIs the Christian-like life, void of humor, creativity or spontaneity?\r\n\r\nIs making molds and busts idolatry? Painting a picture idolatry? Graven Image? False worship?\r\n\r\nCentral to Following Christ is implicit obedience, but a great part of living out our faith is an art and not a science. God doesn't convert us into robots, but He frees us to create in way that's beautiful and honoring to God.\r\n\r\nWe know it isn't Scripture, but does God help those who help themselves?\r\n\r\nA church void of creativity is not the fault of Scripture. It is caused by closed minds.\r\n\r\nThe error comes in when we turn what God has settled into something that is customizable. \r\n\r\n===========================================\r\nCon. Verses:\r\n\r\n Jer 23:17 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you. {imagination: or, stubbornness} \r\n\r\nHabakkuk 2:18\"What profit is the idol when its maker has carved it, Or an image, a teacher of falsehood? For its maker trusts in his own handiwork When he fashions speechless idols.\r\n\r\nDeuteronomy 27:15\r\nVerse Concepts\r\n'Cursed is the man who makes an idol or a molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret ' And all the people shall answer and say, 'Amen.'\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Creativity#sthash.BzDweDtv.dpuf\r\n\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\n- Is all imagination vain?\r\n- A mind free to create is absolutely godly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGod is CREATIVE! and we are created in His image.\r\n\r\nPsalms 139:13-16\r\nVerse Concepts\r\nFor You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Your works, And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth; read more.\r\n\r\nEphesians 2:10\r\nVerse Concepts\r\nFor we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.\r\n\r\nExodus 35:30-35\r\nVerse Concepts\r\nThen Moses said to the sons of Israel, \"See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. \"And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship; to make designs for working in gold and in silver and in bronze, read more. Ex. 31:1-6; 35:30-35; 1 Chronicles 22:15-16; 1 Chr. 25:1-7; Psalms 92:1-3; Ps 98:5; Ps. 144:9; \r\n\r\nCentral to the construction of the Tabernacle was the blueprint God gave Moses on the Mount, but the directives given on the mount wasn't the only influence on the finished product. Instrumental was the craftsmanship of the workers.\r\n\r\n-->36:8\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Creativity#sthash.BzDweDtv.dpuf\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Creativity#sthash.BzDweDtv.dpuf\r\n\r\nGod made us and He made us UNIQUE.\r\n\r\nOriginality and spontaneity. Outside of the box. Not a robot.\r\n\r\nIf we removed all production of the creative mind from out of the church, we would have an unattractive shell. A church without an inventors mind is destined to be stagnate.\r\n\r\n- No Paintings\r\n- No Songs or Poetry\r\n- No Music\r\n- No Clever Illustration\r\n- No Color and Decoration\r\n- No Humor or Laughter\r\n- No New Solutions therefore, always still the same problems. (\"If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always gotten.\")\r\n- No Joyous Dance\r\nPsalms 149:3--Let them praise His name with dancing; Let them sing praises to Him with timbrel and lyre\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Creativity#sthash.BzDweDtv.dpuf\r\n\r\n\r\nThe individual uniqueness that each Believer invests adds great worth to the ministry.\r\n\r\nExamples of Creativity/Invention/Imagination in the Bible:\r\n\r\n1. Genesis - God made everything out of nothing - fig leaves of Adam and Eve - Joseph's plan to save Egypt and his Family\r\n2. Exodus - The Ark Moses was placed in.\r\n3. Leviticus - (this is exclusively a book of laws and yet&hellip;) \r\n4. Numbers - a scarlet cord in Rahab's window\r\n5. Deuteronomy - \r\n6. Joshua -\r\n7. Judges - \r\n\r\nThe Song of Solomon is full of poetry.\r\n\r\n====================================\r\nquotes:\r\n\r\nFaith is an act of the imagination. And a healthy, vibrant imagination is crucial to the Christian life.---http://www.christianitytoday.com/biblestudies/articles/theology/canyouimagine.html, Brandon J. O'Brien\r\n"}
