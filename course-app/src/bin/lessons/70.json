The Law is: an advantage to those who know it (vs. 1-2), absolute in its nature (vs. 3-8), unbending in its authority (vs. 9-19), has a distinct purpose (vs. 20-30), and is not made void, but rather is established\tby our faith. (v. 31).*\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> ILLUSTRATION: Two truck drivers were traveling together hauling a 12&apos; 4&quot; high trailer when they come up on an underpass marked ' Clearance 11&apos; 3&quot; '. The first man asked his partner, &quot;What do you think?&quot; The second checked around for police and seeing none suggested, &quot;Let&apos;s give it a try.&quot;\r\n\r\n### The Standard is an Unchanging Christ\r\n\r\nWe have made a distinction between the specific prescriptions given through Moses and the much more encompassing Mind of God. It is a great error to make the Law of Moses as the entire prescription of God&apos;s will. The fullness of God&apos;s Will is much larger than the Law given through Moses.\r\n\r\nIt is in Jesus, we see the fullness of God&apos;s will. The Lord Jesus Christ is the standard of God&apos;s expectation.\r\n\r\n> Eph 4:11-16 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: 16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of our study we have defined The Law of God as:\r\n\r\n>God&apos;s standard of expectation for his creation.\r\n\r\nGod&apos;s Law is governed by the nature of God. What is in the Law of God is because of Who God is. God is absolute and therefore His Law is absolute--his expectations of the behavior of humanity are absolute. (The majority of the time, Human self-government is anything but absolute.)\r\n> 2 Samuel 22:31 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him. (Compare with Psalm 101)\r\n### If some do not believe, will God break his promise? vs. 3-4\r\nHas God cancelled his covenant with Abraham because some Jews are bad? If some do not believe does it hinder God&apos;s plan? Will unbelief cancel God&apos;s faithfulness? See II Timothy 2:13\r\n\r\n#### The Jews Cling to their Heritage as Abraham&apos;s Children as their Warranty. (v. 3)\r\n\r\nTheir objection was even though some did not believe; nothing can nullify our special promises we have been given by God through Abraham. They were in effect saying no matter what else we are, we are Abraham&apos;s seed and that will get us into heaven.\r\n#### The answer: Absolutely Not! (v.4)\r\nWill God be unfaithful because man is unfaithful? Absolutely Not!\r\n> vs. 4&mdash;God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar&hellip;\r\n> 2 Timothy 2:13 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he **cannot deny himself**.\r\n\r\nIt is not because, some Jews were unfaithful that requires faith in Jesus Christ. It is because the fullness of God&apos;s plan of redemption has always been in Christ.\r\n\r\n> Re 13:8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.\r\n\r\n#### Illustrated from David&apos;s Life\r\n\r\n> &hellip;That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. (v.4)\r\n\r\nThe Psalm of David is quoted which showed God to be righteous even when David was condemned for his sin. According to Psalm 51:4, God is just when He speaks and clear when He judges. This is used here to show that God is right to condemn the Jews because they rejected the Messiah who came from the seed of Abraham according to the promises. These promises they claimed would justify them in fact brought condemnation to the Jew because of their rejection of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n### If our sin commends God&apos;s righteousness, how can He judge us?-Vs. 5-7\r\n\r\n#### Let us first understand the meaning of the question.\r\n\r\nCommend -To represent as worthy of notice, regard, or kindness; to speak in favor of; to recommend. &mdash; Webster The Gk. word carries the meaning of to exhibit (as in a conspicuous manner), or to introduce, to stand with or to come into existence.\r\n\r\nWe must rely on the context to help us understand the meaning of this question. This is posed as two questions in the text and has been simplified for the purpose of study. The question is literally asking: if our unrighteousness magnifies or brings attention to God&apos;s righteousness and mercy; is God unrighteous if He judges us? \r\n\r\nThis is still awkward for us to understand. Remember God is dealing with the actual objections of the Jews. The objection is the same as the objection of many today. We could ask it this way: If God is so righteous why would He judge me for my sin and send me to hell? (Especially, because we are Abraham&apos;s children.)\r\n\r\n#### God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?\r\n\r\nThe answer is: Certainly not. For if this principle is used then how could God pass judgment on the world? The world here is referring to the Gentiles. The Jews were still trying to excuse themselves from condemnation. It is proper for a righteous God to judge the unrighteous sinner&mdash;whether Jew or Gentile.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, God can judge the world because he is righteous.\r\n\r\n### Let us do evil that good may come? &mdash; Vs. 8\r\nSome abuse the truth of God&apos;s mercy and boast that their sinful lives and God&apos;s unconditional acceptance, is illustrative of God&apos;s great Mercy. Paul was NOT preaching this false doctrine, but was being accused of doing so.\r\n\r\nThis was an attack on Paul&apos;s preaching of justification by faith. The Jews were saying: you tell us God justifies the wicked, so why not continue to be evil so good can come out of it?\r\nPaul&apos;s description of those who did preach this was: whose damnation is just. Since the accusation was not true Paul did not go into a detailed answer; he only affirms that God&apos;s judgment on them is just.\r\n"}
