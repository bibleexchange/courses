Paul also emphasizes that the Law of God is holy, just and good.\r\n\r\n### Three Divisions:\r\n\r\n- Verses 1 &mdash; 6: Died that You May be Married to Another\r\n- Verses 7- 13: The Law is Holy, And Just and Good\r\n- Verses 14 &mdash; 25: Paul&apos;s Captivity to the Law of Sin \r\n\r\n## Dead that You May be Married to Another (vs. 1-6)\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n <tr>\r\n <th>1. Bound</th>\r\n <th>2. Buried</th>\r\n <th>3. Raised</th>\r\n </tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td>The sinner is in a binding relationship to his sin as a wife to a husband so long as they both live. </td>\r\n <td>In being buried with Christ, the Power of the law is terminated and its condemnation due to our sin. In being crucified with Christ, the believer's former relationship to sin and the law is terminated and he/she is risen with Christ. </td>\r\n <td>The Believer's union with Christ is altogether different from that old relationship with sin. In Christ our service is with newness of life, newness of Spirit, new power, and as a new creature. Living in sin, we are disabled, but in our union with Christ we are fruitful unto righteousness and holiness.</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n## The Law is Holy, And Just and Good (vs. 7-13)\r\n\r\nIn Romans 7:7-13, Paul establishes the goodness of God&apos;s Law and the wickedness of sin. Service to the letter of the Law cannot make one righteous, but in its exactness it awakens the sinner to his need of Christ. \r\n\r\n<table id=\"law-reveals\" style=\"border:solid 5px gray; padding:10px; text-align:center;\">\r\n<thead></thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td>fact of sin</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>presence of sin</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>effects of sin</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <th>THE LAW REVEALS&hellip;SIN</th>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td>power of sin</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>deceitfulness of sin</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n <td>exceedingly sinfulness of sin**</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n** *In the light of Perfect Holiness, sin becomes \"exceedingly sinful\"*.\r\n\r\n## Paul&apos;s Captivity to the Law of Sin (vs. 14-25)\r\n\r\nIn Romans 7:14-25, Paul brings us to the root of the struggle; the cause of our constant defeat by sin is our own flesh, the &quot;body of this death&quot; (verse 24).\r\n\r\nEvery believer is privileged, enabled and obligated to live a holy life. For those resting in the law for justification and sanctification, it is necessary to convince them of their error. The law is insufficient for for these but grace through Jesus Christ is sufficient. A believing Jew is discharged from his obligations to the ceremonial rituals of the law, and is at liberty to come under the Gospel of God through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, Romans 7:1-4.\r\n\r\n### The \"I's\" in this Section\r\n\r\nA key to the meaning of this section is found in the repetition of Paul referring to himself (\"I\", \"me\", \"my\"). At least, 48 times in this chapter, Paul exposes his own weakness without a single mention of the Holy Ghost. \r\n\r\n**NOTE**: In Chapter 7 the Law is mentioned 20+ times and in Chapter 8 the Holy Spirit is mentioned 20+ times.\r\n\r\n#### Diplomacy\r\n\r\nThis voice taken in this section is in part a case of Paul using diplomacy. Instead of giving his religious and zealous readers cause to be defensive, Paul reaches out to his brethren and is self-critical and testifies of his experience under the law:\r\n\r\n- \"**I** am carnal, sold under sin.\" \r\n- \"Sin dwelleth in **ME**\" (indwelling sin)\r\n- \"In **me** (that is, in **my** flesh,) dwelleth no good thing\"\r\n- The will to do good is present in me, but the power to peform it, **I** find not.\r\n- \"For the good that **I** would **I** do not: but the evil which **I** would not, that **I** do.\"\r\n- \"when **I** would do good, evil is present with **me**.\"\r\n- \"**I** see another law in **my** members, warring against the law of **my** mind, and bringing **me** into captivity to the law of sin\"\r\n- \"O wretched man that **I** am!\"\r\n\r\n#### The inability of the flesh\r\n\r\nThe emphasis on self profoundly exhibits the inability of the flesh. Paul in his shared experience under the law testifies what \"I\" am struggling to do, and utterly failing to do in my own strength.\r\n\r\n### We see three confessions in this section of the Chapter:\r\n\r\n#### The First Confession: Verse 14, \"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.\"\r\n\r\n\tThe 2 words in the Greek for carnal\r\n\t- one implying that which is purely material\r\n\t- the other implying that which is ethical\r\n\r\n\tThe former suggests man's nature as weak.\r\n\tThe latter suggests man's character as sinful.\r\n\r\n#### The Second Confession: Verses 18 - 20, \"In my flesh dwelleth no good thing.\"\r\n\r\n\tHere we see Paul describing a struggle. In him so far as his person was carnal, there dwelt no good thing because of the influence of sin.\r\n\r\n#### The Third Confession: Verses 21 - 25,\r\n\r\n\t\"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.\"\r\n\r\n\tHe is ever conscious of moral contraction and conflict within. He has a desire to do good and yet an evil is always present.\r\n\r\n\r\n### PARALLEL:\r\n\r\n\tOn the one hand the inward man is delighted in God's law. On the other hand he saw a different law in his members warring against the law of his mind and bringing him into a spiritual bondage.\r\n\r\nNOTE: \tThe \"inward man\" is not the same as \"the new man\", nor is the mind ever used of the renewed nature. It is the immaterial part of man.\r\n\r\n### What are the 4 Laws mentioned in Verses 21 - 22?\r\n\r\n\t1.\tLaw of God - (moral law - written or unwritten)\r\n\t2.\tLaw of Sin - (reigns since fall of man)\r\n\t3.\tLaw of Mind - (moral sense of man)\r\n\t4.\tLaw of Members - (leads individual to falling under law of sin)\r\n\r\n### CONCLUSION of Chapter 7:\r\n\r\n#### Verse 24:\tCRY OF AGONY AND CONFLICT\r\n\r\n> \"O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\"\r\n\r\n\t\tThe body of this death - what a fearful description of the body! Unredeemed, unchanged, under the law of sin in all its members. \r\n\r\nTo dwell undelivered in such a body is to find it a \"body of death\".\r\n\r\n### Is this section an accurate description of the Born Again Believer's Relationship to Sin?\r\n\r\n- SOLD UNDER SIN, SIN DWELLING INSIDE, NO GOOD THING DWELLS INSIDE, THE WILL PRESENT BUT NO POWER, EVIL ALWAYS PRESENT INSIDE, ALWAYS LOSING THE WAR OF MY MIND AND AGAINST MY FLESH, CAPTIVE TO THE LAW OF SIN, WRETCHED.\r\n\r\n> Romans 3:9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are **all under sin**;\r\n\r\n> Romans 6:14&mdash;For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n**Can I Overcome Evil?**\r\n\r\n> Ephesians 6:13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. (margin: \"having overcome all..\"\r\n\r\nHaving Escaped!\r\n\r\n> 2 Peter 2:20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.\r\n\r\n> 1 John 2:13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.\r\n\r\n**A Remedy has been provided for indwelling sin!**\r\n\r\n> Col 3:1-3&mdash;If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. 2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.\r\n\r\nIs my mind captive to sin?\r\n\r\n> Romans 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\r\n\r\n#### Verse 25:\t\"I thank God, (for deliverance) through Jesus Christ our Lord\"\r\n\r\n(We need a renewed mind)\r\nIn summary, Paul discovered:\r\n\r\n1.\tThat sin dwelt in him - though he delighted in God's law.\r\n2.\tThat his will was powerless against it.\r\n3.\tThat the sinful self was not his real self. <<image of God>>\r\n4.\tThat there is a difference through our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n"}
