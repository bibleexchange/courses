It is an inspired and spontaneous utterance of the spirit in the ordinary language of the people assembled.\r\n\r\nC.\tInterpretation is no more a product of the human mind than speaking with \ttongues.\r\n\r\n1.\tIt is the product of the Holy Ghost through the vocal organs of the speaker.\r\n\r\n## Characteristics of the Gift\r\n\r\nA.\tThe natural gifts and training will influence the statement; but it will be none \tthe less supernatural.\r\n\r\nB.\tThose who speak in tongues are instructed to pray for the interpretation.\r\n\r\n&ndash;\tI Cor. 14:13\r\n\r\nC.\tLet one interpret. &ndash; I Cor. 14:27\r\n\r\nD.\tMuch prayer, wisdom and faith is necessary and will be needed, this will avoid \tconfusion amongst God&apos;s children.\r\n\r\n## The Purpose of the Gift\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\tTo make understandable the message that is given in the unknown tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \tIt is the Gift of Interpretation and not translation through explanation of the unknown tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tIt can easily be longer\r\nbecause it is an interpretation and not a \ttranslation.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\tThe English verb &quot;interpret&quot; is found in three forms in the Greek New \tTestament.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\t&quot;Hermeneuo&quot; means &quot;to\r\nexplain&quot; and usually applies to translation \tfrom one language to\r\nanother (John 1:38 Heb. 7:2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\t&quot;Methermeneuo&quot; is\r\nalways used with the thought of exact translation in \tmind, as may\r\nbe observed in Matt. 1:23 Mark 5:41\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\t&quot;Diermeneuo&quot; which means &quot;to explain thoroughly&quot; clearly indicating \tthe desire to go beyond translation, so as to show not only the sense of a statement, but also its significance as related to the hearer.\r\n\r\n&ndash; I Cor. 12:30 I Cor. 14:5\r\n\r\nThe Greek word &quot;diermeneuo&quot; translated &quot;interpret&quot; in I Cor. 12\r\nI Cor. 14:5 is used in Luke 24:27, here the Lord Jesus met the\r\ndiscouraged disciples returning homeward on the road to Emmaus. &quot;He\r\nexpounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning\r\nHimself.&quot;\r\n\r\nIf we admit that in relation to Christ it means exposition as well as clarification, it must be so in Paul&apos;s teachings.\r\n\r\n## Examples of the Gift\r\n\r\nDuring Belshazzar&apos;s feast the finger of God appeared on the wall.\r\n\r\nHe had no difficulty in translating the writing for it was the Samaritan script of the pure Hebrew , which he had learned in his childhood before Judah had been carried away.\r\n\r\nThe writing &mdash;\r\n\t&quot;Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin.&quot;\r\n\tAn exact translation of these syllables is:\r\n\t&quot;Numeration,numeration, weighing division.&quot;\r\n Had Daniel simply translated the writing this is all he would have said, but by the spirit he not only knew the meaning of the words but was able to explain.\r\n\r\n## Study Questions 12: Interpretation of Tongues\r\n\r\n- Is interpretation of tongues an independent gift?\r\n- Give definition of this gift.\r\n- Is interpretation a natural product of the human mind?\r\n- Does natural gifts and training have any effect on this gift?\r\n- What are those that speak in tongues instructed to do?\r\n- How many should interpret a message?\r\n- What is the purpose of the gift?\r\n- Explain the difference between translation and interpretation.\r\n- Is the interpretation the same in length as the message in tongues?\r\n- Explain.\r\n- Give three Greek words and their meaning of the word &quot;interpret&quot; in the New Testament.\r\n"}
