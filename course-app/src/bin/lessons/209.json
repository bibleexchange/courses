Sixty nine of those weeks of years have already been fulfilled. There is yet one week of years that must be fulfilled. Seven years that God will again deal with the nation of Israel. In between the sixty-ninth and seventieth week there has been a period of Grace in which God has dealt with all the world.\n\nAccording to what I understand from prophetic truth there will be another world war in which God will fight for the Nation of Israel, as He did in the Old Testament, and this will be the ushering in of the Seventieth week of years. As is often referred to as the Seven Years of Tribulation. Before this World War the Bride of Christ (the overcomer) will be translated as is painly revealed in the scripture. In Luke 21:36 &quot;Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to Escape all these things that shell come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.&quot; The Bride of Christ will be translated in the First Watch of the Night that is followed by the dark night of tribulation. Where in the Church that has been sleeping will be awakened by persecution during this first three and a half years. Matthew 25:5-6; Luke 12:35-38. &quot;While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made. Behold the Bridegroom cometh; to ye out to meet Him.&quot;\n\nI.\tThe Bible Teaches that Within this Seven-Years of Tribulation Several Things Will Take Place:\n\n1.\tThe Antichrist will arise &mdash; II Thess. 2:3\n2.\tThe Persecution of the Church &mdash; Matthew 24:9\n3.\tThe Revival of Joel&apos;s Prophecy - Joel 2:28-29\n4.\tThe Rapture of the Church &mdash; I Thess. 4:16-17\n5.\tThe Great Tribulation &mdash; Matthew 24:21; Rev. 7:14\n6.\tThe Releasing of God&apos;s Judgments &mdash; \nSeals &mdash; Trumpets &mdash; Vials &mdash; Rev. 6:1 &mdash; 8:1; 8:2 - 11; 16:1 &mdash; 17\n7.\tThe Wrath of God &mdash; II Thess. 1:7 &mdash; 8; Rev. 6:1 &mdash; 17\n8.\tThe Kingdoms of this World becoming the Kingdoms of Our Lord &mdash; Rev. 11:15\n\nII.\tThe Bible Teches that there are Three Major sections to the Seventieth Week (The Tribulation).\n\n1.\tThe Beginning of Sorrows &mdash; Matthew 24:8\n2.\tThe Great Tribulation &mdash; Matthew 24:27; Rev. 7:18.\n3.\tThe Day of the Lord &mdash; Matthew 24:29-31; Mark 13:24-26; Rev. 6:17; Rev. 16:14.\n\nIII.\tThe Bible teaches that two events must take place before the Day of The Lord.\n\n1.\tThe Apostasy of the Church &mdash; Rev. 3:14-16\n2.\tThe Revealing of the Man of Sin. II Thess. 2:1-4\nIV.\tThe Bible Teaches that the Great Tribulation begins in the middle of the Seven-Year Period. Matthew 24:21; Rev. 7:14.\n\nV.\tThe Bible Teaches When the Day of the Lord Will Come. Rev. 11:15 &quot;At the Sounding of the Seventh Trumpet.&quot; Rev. 6:17 &quot; For the great day of His Wrath is Come.&quot;\n\nVI.\tThe Bible Teaches that the Day of the Lord is a time of unprecedented judgment upon the whole world. Dan. 12:1; Matthew 24:21; II Thess. 1:7-8.\n\n\nVII.\tThe Bible Teaches there are two phases to His Second Coming-\n\n1.\tThe Secret Coming &mdash; &quot;In the air- I Thess. 4:16-17. The Parousia &quot;His coming &mdash; Like a Thief &mdash; I Thess. 5:1-2. The Rapture &mdash; &quot;Harpaxo&quot; to snatch or catch away. Latin &quot;Rapere&quot;- &quot;Raptum&quot; to seize and carry away. This is where our English work rapture comes from.\n2.\tThe &quot;Epipheneia&quot; &mdash; Eng. &quot;Epiphany&quot; &mdash; The Revelation &mdash; Luke 21:25-27; I Cor. 15:52; II Thess. ; Rev. 1:7\n\n\nVIII.\tThe Bible Teaches Some Will Escape All.\n\n1.\tThe Bride (The Overcomer). Luke 21:36; Rev. 3:10; Rev. 3:21.\n2.\tThe Bride will return with the Bridegroom- To catch away the church for the Marriage Supper. Matthew 25:1-6 &quot;Bride and Bridegroom.&quot; The Vulgate &mdash; Latin &mdash; Syrian versions &mdash; Moffatt. &mdash; Luke 12:35-38; Rev. 19:9."}
