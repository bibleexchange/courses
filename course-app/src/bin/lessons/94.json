This section is particularly practical in its instruction. We see the righteousness of God applied to the daily life of the Believer.\r\n\r\nRomans chapter twelve deals with the Christian&apos;s duties, which ultimately leads to a surrendered life. The church is compared to the human body. There should be unity among the body, if there is no unity, the body will not function properly. This chapter also deals with the different duties of the church. This chapter ends with the Christian spirit. We are not to overcome but not with evil but we are to overcome with good. \r\n\r\n### Word Studies\r\n\r\nOften times words lose their value with us with overuse. Let us look more closely at the vocabulary of the first two verses of this chapter that we may gain a deeper understanding of it:\r\n\r\n**Beseech** &mdash; This has the ideas of to call near and intreat. This is a plea in earnest.\r\n\r\n**Therefore** &mdash; What is it THERE FOR? All of Chapter eleven expresses what grace has brought about. The outcast has been included. Therefore, we must do&hellip;.\r\n\r\n**Brethren** &mdash; He speaks to those that have been blood bought and born again. Not, the Israel of Isaac, but of the spiritual Israel. \r\n\r\n**Mercies of God** &mdash; It is by the mercy of God that we would be hearing such a plea. Had it not been for God&apos;s mercy shown on the road to Damascus, Paul could not make such a plea. He does not make the plea because he is better than everyone, but because of God&apos;s mercy is he qualified to make such a plea.\r\n\r\n**Bodies** &mdash; In the mortal body we must glorify God. Not just someday and for now do the best that we can. &hellip;We should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.&mdash;Titus 2:12\r\n\r\n**Living Sacrifice** &mdash; The flesh must be crucified. Our will must be crucified. We offer alive, but God thoroughly will purge us as long as we remain on the altar.\r\n\r\n**Holy** &mdash; Our lives ought to be light to those that wander in the darkness.\r\n\r\n**Acceptable unto God** &mdash; fully agreeable; well pleasing In this age full of men pleasers, we must seek our approval from God. What does He think about a direction you take? To be accepted by this world is to be rejected by Him. We cannot be agreeable with the flesh and this world and at the same time be agreeable to God. There must be a clear line of alliance defined. Who will you side with?\r\n\r\n**Reasonable service** &mdash; His yoke is easy, but any requirement God could make of us would pale in greatness to what He has provided for us.\r\n\r\n**Conformed** &mdash; Conform to the same pattern; fashion self according to; \r\n\r\n**Transformed** &mdash; metamorphosis; change; This is the miraculous work of God.\r\n\r\n**Renewing of your Mind** &mdash; Our mind is made new by the Word. Replace our carnal thoughts with What saith the Lord.\r\n\r\n**Good, Acceptable, & Perfect Will of God** &mdash; This is not God&apos;s three wills, but three adjectives of God&apos;s one sovereign will. He is not double-minded (or triple-minded for that matter).\r\n\r\n### God's Perfect Will\r\n\r\nPaul's Great Plea for Personal Consecration to God, in view of His mercies. Paul teaches desiring the perfect will of God for each believer.\r\n\r\nInstructions are given for the Believer to follow. This chapter is so rich, a lifetime could be devoted to its study. Let us complete our introduction to Romans 12 with a simple list of the different thoughts presented in Romans 12. They are categorized respectively: 1) God&apos;s gifts to man, and 2) man&apos;s return responsibility to God for what God has given.\r\n\r\n## Verse 1\r\n\r\n> 1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.\r\n\r\ncross references: Ps 50:13-14; Ro 6:13,16,19; 1Co 6:13,20; 2Co 10:1; Heb 10:20; 1Pe 2:5\r\n\r\n#### The Sacrifice\r\n\r\n\"present your bodies\" - not the soul only but the body as well. \"With the spirit worship God but wiht the body sin. -- ought not be. \r\n\r\nMind, hands, feet, eyes, ears, hands, the intellect, ambitions\r\n\r\n#### The Nature of the Sacrifice\r\n\r\n1. Sacrifice \r\n\r\na free will offering, it will cost you something, \r\n\r\nDavid bought Araunah's threshing floor 1 Chronicles 21:24.\r\n\r\n2. Living\r\n\r\nWe must present ourselves ALIVE to God!\r\n\r\n3. Holy\r\n\r\n4 Acceptable\r\n\r\n\"unto God\"\r\n\r\n#### The Reasonableness of the Sacrifice\r\n\r\n### What are the \"mercies of God\" to which Paul refers?\r\n\r\n1. Justification - including pardon, removal from sins, trespasses never to be remembered, a right standing in Christ - being made the righteousness of God in Him.\r\n\r\n2. Identification - taken out of Adam by death with Christ - dead to sin and the law - we now become identified with Christ.\r\n\r\n3. Under Grace - Fruit unto God - unto sanctification, made possible.\r\n\r\n4. The Spirit Indwelling - the spirit witnesses of Sonship and Heirship.\r\n\r\n5. Help in Infirmity - and in any present sufferings, on our way to share Christ's glory.\r\n\r\n6. Divine Election - our final conformity to the image of Christ - God's settled purpose.\r\n\r\n7. Coming Glory - beyond any comparison with sufferings.\r\n\r\n8. No Separation Possible - God loves us in Christ.\r\n\r\n9. Confidence in God's Faithfulness - confirmed by His revealed plans for Israel.\r\n\r\n### Reasonable Service\r\n\r\n**GOD HAS GIVEN SO MUCH TO HIS PEOPLE**: Grace Given, Dealt to every man the measure of faith, made One Body in Christ, Gifts, Prophecy, rewards according to faith, Ministry, Teaching, Exhorting, etc.\r\n\r\n**GOD&apos;s PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO ACT ACCORDINGLY**: Think Soberly, Giving with Simplicity, Ruling with Diligence, Show mercy with Cheerfulness, Let Love be without Dissimulation, Abhor that which is evil, Cleave to that which is good, Kindly Affectioned, Brotherly Love, In Honor Preferring one Another, not Slothful in Business, Fervent in Spirit, Serving the Lord, Rejoicing in hope, Patient in Tribulation, Continuing Instant in Prayer, Distributing to the necessity of Saints, Given to Hospitality, Bless them which Persecute You, bless and Curse Not, Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep, Be of the same mind one toward another, etc.\r\n\r\n> Romans 12:1 [Amplified Bible] &mdash; I appeal to you therefore, brethren, and beg of you in view of [all] the mercies of God, to make a decisive dedication of your bodies [presenting all your members and faculties] as a living sacrifice, holy (devoted, consecrated) and well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable (rational, intelligent) service and spiritual worship.\r\n\r\n- A Right Attitude is Essential Acts 1:14\r\n- Ask - for it is a gift Acts 10:45\r\n- Fast and Pray Acts 9:9-17\r\n- Obedience Acts 5:32\r\n\r\n## Verse 2\r\n\r\n> 2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\r\n\r\ncross references: Eph 1:18; 4:23; 5:10,17; Col 1:21-22; 3:10; 1Th 4:3; 1Pe 1:14; 1Jo 2:15\r\n\r\n### Being not conformed to the world:\r\n\r\n&quot;conformed&quot; [suschematizo] to fashion alike; to conform to the same pattern; like a stamped image\r\n\r\n&quot;this world&quot; : this age (&quot;aion&quot; [GREEK] &mdash; a period of time)\r\n\r\nMarked by spiritual or moral characteristics.\r\n\r\n#### 1. The Believer and his Lifestyle is to be Remarkably Different than the World\r\n\r\n- **In Doctrine and Religion**\r\n\r\nFor the Believer, doctrine and religion are matters of God's written will (the Scriptures) and not matters of opinion and personal preference. \r\n\r\n> 1 Corinthians 2:12&ndash;13 &mdash; 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which manâ€™s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> 1 Timothy 6:3-5 &mdash; 3 If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; 4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> John 17:17-21&mdash; 17 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. 18  As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. 19  And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. 20  Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; 21  That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. \r\n\r\n- **In Lifestyle**\r\n\r\nThe Believer has God-given direction on Marriage (union and divorce), family relationships, child-raising, and even the selection of friends.\r\n\r\n> Ephesians 6:1-9&mdash;  1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. 2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) 3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. 4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. 5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;  6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free. 9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> 1 Coritnhians 15:33-34&mdash;Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. 34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.\r\n\r\n- **In Entertainment**\r\n\r\n1. Will this activity violate my conscience?\r\n\r\n>  Romans 14:22-23&mdash; Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.  23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. \r\n\r\n2. Will my doing this activity cause weaker Christians to lose their faith or will it set a bad example of Christian behavior for others? (1 Corinthians 10:23-33)\r\n\r\n> 1 Corinthians 10:32-33 &mdash;32 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: 33 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. \r\n\r\n3. Will this activity place me under evil influences?\r\n\r\n> 1 Samuel 28:7&mdash;Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n>  1 Corinthians 6:19-20&mdash;What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Godâ€™s. \r\n\r\n- **In Civil Matters**\r\n\r\nThe Christian must be obedient to civil authority although others might take their obligation to authority lightly. \r\n\r\n> Mark 12:17&mdash;And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Romans 13:1&mdash;Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God\r\n\r\n- **Materialism**\r\n\r\n&quot;Materialism is the preoccupation with material things rather than intellectual or spiritual things.&quot;\r\n\r\n> 1 John 2:15&mdash; Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> Matthew 19:21&mdash;Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me. \r\n\r\nMaterialism is not necessarily having things or even just wanting nice things, bug it is an obesession with the desire for and care of stuff&mdash; it is allowing things to have me. Beware of the DECEITFULNESS of riches.\r\n\r\n> Mark 4:19&mdash;And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Which Image is Making its mark on us?\r\n\r\n- The world uses the principles of God to become successful for their own gain. We are to use the principles of God to become successful not for us but for Him and His kingdom.\r\n\r\n- Winning Favor or Winning souls for the kingdom? (Proverbs 11:30) \r\n\r\n- How do we receive our ideas? As the World does or through Prayer? \r\n\r\n- The measure of success\r\n\r\nWhy do I want to be a successful Christian? Success is learning how to lead others to Christ. We are to pattern our lives after Christ. \r\n\r\n### Be Transformed\r\n\r\n\"transformed&quot; [metamorphoo] to transform (\"metamorphose\"):--change, transfigure, transform\r\n\r\nContrasted with \"conformed\"/\"suschematizo\" (which is an outward, surface, shallow imposing and stamping which begins outward), \"transform\"/\"metamorphoo\" is a change that begins inward and ripples outward.\r\n\r\n> Matthew 17:1&ndash;2&mdash;And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,2 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. \r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Matthew Henry's Commentary &mdash;The work of the Holy Ghost first begins in the understanding, and is carried on to the will, affections, and conversation, till there is a change of the whole man into the likeness of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness. Thus, to be godly, is to give up ourselves to God.\r\n\r\n### Renewing of Your Mind\r\n\r\n1. The Renewing of our Mind happens through the Word of God. \r\n\r\n> 2 Timothy 2:15&mdash;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Psalm 119:9&mdash;Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Psalm 119:105&mdash;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. \r\n\r\n2. The Rewing of Our Mind is a Work of the Holy Spirit\r\n\r\nThe whole \"mind\" must be under the Spirit's renewing power. The entire mind must come under the spirits control.\r\n\r\n> Ephesians 5:17-20&mdash;17Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. 18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; 19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;\r\n\r\n3. The Renewed Mind is the Mind of Christ\r\n\r\nNot just a different mind or another mind, but the work of God in us produces the mind of Christ.\r\n\r\n> Philippians 2:5&mdash;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> 1 Corinthians 2:14-16&mdash;14But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. 16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. \r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Luke 19:10&mdash;For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. \r\n<!-- -->\r\n>2 Timothy 1:7&mdash;For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n>John 8:50&mdash;And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.\r\n\r\n### Will of God\r\n\r\nWhat becomes the motivating center of a Christians life? THE WILL OF GOD.\r\n\r\nReal Salvation = Practical holiness\r\n\r\nWearing His righteousness and thus daily purifying ourselves \r\n\r\nSuccessful Christians:\r\n\r\n1. They have a sound foundation (which is the Word of God)\r\n2. They have a sound work habits\r\n3. They esteem others before themselves\r\n4. They keep their self-respect by being loyal to God and His holy word\r\n5. They do things God&apos;s way, understanding that it always the best way\r\n6. They are very cooperative (finding what God wants in any situation and doing it)\r\n7. They listen to others (and in return they are heard)\r\n8. They are enthusiastic about every endeavor that they are faced with\r\n9. They are a friend (and in return they have friends)\r\n10. They are sincere\r\n11. They set goals (both small and large goals)\r\n12. They use any failure as a stepping stone for success\r\n13. They set their mind (on things above, not on the things of this earth)\r\n14. They find a place to rest their mind (in fasting and praying)\r\n15. They have skill &mdash; they are instant in season and out of season\r\n16. They give God the glory for they have accomplished\r\n17. They check their motives"}
