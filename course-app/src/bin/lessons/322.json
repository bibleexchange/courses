Striving for a consistent Godly life.\n\nOur lives often are like a roller coaster. We get attached to the feel good parts of our faith. \"My sins are gone.\" \"I'm forgiven.\" But, forget how to behave when we don't 'feel so good.'\n\n## 1. Being Good Enough\n\n A Matter of Acceptance.\n\nMt 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\n-----\n CS LEWIS: MERE CHRISTIANITY: \"Unless you are perfect, I will not help you\"; and as we cannot be perfect, then, if He meant that, our position is hopeless. But I do not think He did mean that. I think He meant \"The only help I will give is help to become perfect.\n------\n### The Meaning of Goodness\n\n- What does it mean for a person to be good?\n- Is there goodness in all of us?\n\n> Genesis 1:31&mdash;And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.\n\nIsaiah 5:20&mdash; Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!\n\nPs 119:68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.\n\nNO GOODNESS APART FROM GOD. Goodness is God's fingerprint.\n\nYou are accepted through Christ, not because of works you have done.\n\n## 2. Doing Good\n\nA Matter of Obedience. (Discipline of a godly life.)\n\n### The Desire: Goodness\n\nPs 34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.\n\nRomans 12:21 overcome evil with good\n\n### The Problem: What Gets in the Way\n\nWaiting until I feel like it.\n\n### Remedy\n\nEmpowered to do good because it is good not necessarily because it feels good.\n\n> Ephesians 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. \n\n#### Knowing The Standard for Good\n\n#### Understanding the Standard\n\n#### Applying the Standard\n\n"}
