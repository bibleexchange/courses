Dealing with this subject it seems that Jude quotes from Peter. (Compare II Peter 3:3 and Jude 18) They both describe the same kind of false teachers &mdash; men of loose morals and shameful excesses. Also Peter describes a future apostasy whereas Jude speaks of it as present. Peter describes the false teachers as godless and extremely dangerous but not at their worst. Jude describes them as depraved and as lawless as they can be. Also it is interesting to note that Jude quotes directly from the book of Enoch, which is otherwise not part of the Bible canon. He cites Enoch's prophecy that the Lord would come with many thousands of his saints to render judgment on the whole world. He also paraphrases an incident in a text that has been lost about Satan and Michael quarrelling over the body of Moses.</p>\n<h3>When written:</h3> <p>Probably between 70 &amp; 80 A.
