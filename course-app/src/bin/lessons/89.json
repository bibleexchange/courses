The Sorrow of the Apostle at Israel's Rejection (9:1-5)\r\n2. The Rejection of Israel and God's Sovereignty (9:6-29)\r\n3. The Rejection of Israel and Human Responsibility (9:30-10:21)\r\n4. The Rejection of Israel and God's Purpose for their Future (11:1-32)\r\n5. The Apostle's Words of Praise of God (11:33-36)\r\n\r\n## The Rejection of Israel and God's Purpose for their Future (11:1-32)\r\n\r\n### Israel's Rejection is not Universal, vs. 1-10\r\n\r\n> Romans 11:1 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.\r\n 2 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,\r\n 3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.\r\n 4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.\r\n 5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.\r\n 6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.\r\n 7 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded\r\n 8 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.\r\n 9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:\r\n 10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.\r\n\r\n- The Rejection is of the UNBELIEVING Jew\r\n\r\n> Ac 14:2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Re 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\r\n\r\n- IF Believe\r\n\r\n> Ex 4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. Ex 4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land. \r\n\r\n> Mr 9:23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Joh 3:12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Joh 5:47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Joh 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Joh 11:40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Blinding is Purposeful and Does not Have to be Permanent, vs. 11-21\r\n\r\n 11 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.\r\n 12 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?\r\n 13 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:\r\n 14 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.\r\n 15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?\r\n 16 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.\r\n 17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;\r\n 18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.\r\n 19 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.\r\n 20 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:\r\n 21 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.\r\n\r\n- God's Call and Choice\r\n\r\n===============================================================\r\n===============================================================\r\n===============================================================\r\n# Chosen in Christ\r\n\r\n## Greek Words\r\n\r\n- Ephesians 1:4 \"CHOSEN\"\r\n\r\nChrist as the head of the church (Eph. 1:22) and his Church?? chosen in Him.\r\n\r\n1586. eklegomai eklegomai, ek-leg'-om-ahee \r\nmiddle voice from 1537 and 3004 (in its primary sense); to select:--make choice, choose (out), chosen. \r\n\r\n1586 found in 19 verses. \r\n\r\n> Mark 13:20&mdash;&hellip;the elect's sake <eklektos>, whom <hos> he hath chosen <eklegomai>, he hath shortened <koloboo> the days <hemera>&hellip;\r\n\r\n## Chosen for Service\r\n\r\n> Luke 6:13 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;\r\n\r\n> John 6:70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?\r\n\r\n> John 13:18 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.\r\n\r\n> Ac 1:2 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:\r\n\r\n> Ac 1:24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,\r\n\r\n> Ac 6:5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:\r\n\r\n>Ac 15:7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.\r\n\r\n> Ac 15:22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> Lu 10:42 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.\r\n\r\n> Joh 15:16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\r\n\r\n> Joh 15:19 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.\r\n\r\n## Choosing of Israel\r\n\r\n> Ac 13:17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Ac 15:25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,\r\n 1Co 1:27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;\r\n 1Co 1:28 And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:\r\n Eph 1:4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:\r\n Jas 2:5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?\r\n\r\nHeb 10:14 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.\r\n\r\n## Scriptures\r\n\r\n> Ephesians 1:1&mdash;&hellip;to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: &hellip; 3 &hellip; 4 According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: 5 Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 6 To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.\r\n 7 &hellip; 8 &hellip; 9 &hellip; 10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: 11 In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:\r\n 12 &hellip; 13 &hellip; after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> Matthew 22:14&mdash;For many are called, but few are chosen.\r\n \r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> John 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. 39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. 40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\r\n\r\n> John 10:27-29&mdash;My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. 29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nSynergists: combination of faith and God's choice.\r\n\r\nMonergism: God's kingly freedom, choice\r\n\r\nCan Jesus fail to do the Father's will? \r\n\r\n===============================================================\r\n===============================================================\r\n===============================================================\r\n- Repent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### God's Will is to Have Mercy Upon All, vs. 22-32\r\n\r\n 22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.\r\n 23 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.\r\n 24 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?\r\n 25 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.\r\n 26 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:\r\n 27 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.\r\n 28 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.\r\n 29 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.\r\n 30 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:\r\n 31 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.\r\n 32 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.\r\n\r\n> Matthew Henry \"By rejecting the gospel, and by their indignation at its being preached to the Gentiles, the Jews were become enemies to God.\"\r\n\r\n- God's Mercy\r\n\r\n> Ps 13:5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Ps 89:2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Jas 5:11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy."}
