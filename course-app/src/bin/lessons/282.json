The Need to Search - \"I sought Him\"\r\n\r\n### 1. Something had separated them.\r\n\r\n### 2. When the Holy Spirit is grieved then fellowship is broken.\r\n\r\n### 3. THINGS have a way of separating us.\r\n\r\n### 4. She sought Him because she feels deeply her need.\r\n\r\n### 5. The more precious and real He is to us, the more we deeply feel the loss of fellowship.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n## II. The Time to Search - \"By Night\"\r\n\r\n### 1. When you FIRST feel your loss. The sense of darkness.\r\n\r\n### 2. It is always night, when He is not there.\r\n\r\n### 3. Distance implies darkness as He is the light!\r\n\r\n### 4. Don't wait until you lose the FEELING OF NEED.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n## III. The Manner of Search - \r\n\r\n### 1. \"On My Bed\"\r\n\r\nThe bed is a place of ease and inactivity. He is not found lying on her bed.\r\n\r\n> Jeremiah 29:13 &mdash; And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.\r\n\r\n### 2. \"In the Streets\"\r\n\r\nShe is out of bed and out into Society. She is seeking the living among the dead. (Luke 24:5)\r\n\r\n### 3. Among \"the Watchmen\"\r\n\r\nWatchmen today are not in touch with Him.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n## IV. The Results of the Search\r\n\r\n### 1. \"I FOUND HIM\"\r\n\r\n- Beyond the watchmen.\r\n- \"I passed from them.\" v.3\r\n- \"I found HIM\"\r\n\r\n### 2. \"I HELD HIM\", v. 4\r\n\r\n- \"would not let him go\"\r\n- \"Mother's house\" Where the Bride was birthed. \r\n- The Church - We need to bring Him into the Church (\"Mother's House\")\r\n- Not all will want Him.\r\n- But some will."}
