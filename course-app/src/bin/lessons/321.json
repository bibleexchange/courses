O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.\r\n\r\n1. What are the psalms of thanksgiving?\r\n\r\nThey express thanksgiving for what God has done or in anticipation of what He will do. \r\n\r\n- They may be individual (Chapters 9, 10, 30, 32, 34, 40, 41, 92, 107, 116, 138), \r\n- or national (Chapters 65-68, 118, 124).\r\n\r\n2. Let us not just read these Psalms, but do what is instructed!\r\n\r\n3. For what am I giving thanks?\r\n\r\n## Psalm 9\r\n\r\n> [TITLE] \"To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Chief Musician\" is generally regarded as the chief leader and director of worship which ulimately points to God Himself. (Zephaniah 3:17;)\r\n\r\nMuthlabben means \"the death of the son\" and could be a forgotten instrument or a reference to some event in David's Life.\r\n\r\n- Some see a connection with the death of Bathsheba's first son and this psalm.\r\n- Some apply the title as the ancient Chaldee version does: \"Concerning the death of the Champion who went out between the camps,\" referring to Goliath. Perhaps David wrote this Psalm remembering the victory over Goliath from the advantage of many years since that triumph.\r\n- Perhaps there is a connection with deaths of Nabal, Absalom, or the armies defeated David.\r\n- Perhaps it is some vocal tone (for women voices) or some forgotten musical instrument unknown\r\n\r\n > Psalm 9:16,17 &mdash;The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. 17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.\r\n\r\n- Higgaion means \"meditate on that.\"\r\n- Selah is found in two books of the Bible, but is most prevalent in the Psalms, where it appears 71 times. It also appears three times in Habakkuk 3. It is difficult to defined Selah, but one possible Hebrew word related to selah is calah, which means “to hang” or “to measure or weigh in the balances.” Selah is also thought to be rendered from two Hebrew words: s_lah, “to praise”; and s_lal, “to lift up.” Another commentator believes it comes from salah, a musical notation instructing “to pause.” --> Pause and Praise God\r\n\r\n## Psalm 10\r\n\r\n> v. 11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.\r\n\r\nVerses 2-11, The wicked man may mistake God's patience for blindness because He hasn't already destroyed them.\r\n\r\n> v. 18 &mdash; To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, **that the man of the earth may no more oppress**.\r\n\r\nWhy is God so patient with the evil doer?\r\n\r\n> Psalm 78:40,41 &mdash; How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! 41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.\r\n\r\nPsalm 50:20-21; 78:38; 86:15; 103:8; 145:8; \r\n\r\nRead Romans 9:22-24.\r\n\r\n- The Mercy of Space for Repentance\r\n- The Wisdom of Perfecting His People\r\n\r\n## Psalm 30\r\n\r\n> [TITLE] A Psalm and Song at the dedication of the house of David.\r\n\r\nAlso translated, \"A Psalm; A Song of Dedication for the House. By David\". \r\n\r\nDavid has written a Psalm for the dedication of the Temple of the LORD. This is a song of faith since David never lived to see the Temple, but he was committed to not miss out on its dedication!\r\n\r\n### God's Actions toward Me\r\n\r\nlifted me up, hast not made my foes to rejoice over me, hast healed me, hast brought up my soul from the grave, his holiness, his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life, hast made my mountain to stand strong, thou didst hide thy face, hast turned for me my mourning into dancing \r\n\r\n### My Responses toward God\r\n\r\nextol thee, cried unto thee,  Sing unto the LORD, give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness, I made supplication, cried for mercy and help, not be silent, I will give thanks unto thee for ever\r\n\r\n- extol: To lift up; esteem; praise; to elevate; as to extol one's virtues. TO DECLARE GREAT\r\n\r\n> French writer Alexis de Tocqueville, after visiting America in 1831, said “I sought for the greatness of the United States in her commodious harbors, her ample rivers, her fertile fields, and boundless forests—and it was not there. I sought for it in her rich mines, her vast world commerce, her public school system, and in her institutions of higher learning— and it was not there. I looked for it in her democratic Congress and her matchless Constitution—and it was not there. Not until I went into the churches of America and heard her pulpits flame with righteousness did I understand the secret of her genius and power. America is great because America is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great!”\r\n\r\n## Psalm 32\r\n\r\n> [TITLE] A Psalm of David, Maschil.\r\n\r\nMaschil = instructing. Maschil occurs in the title of thirteen Psalms. It denotes a song enforcing some lesson of wisdom or piety, a didactic song. In Psalms 47:7 it is rendered \"with understanding;\" also \"in a skilful psalm.\"\r\n\r\nThis psalm was written after David's sin with Bathsheba, when Nathan, the prophet of God, came to reveal the sin to David (2 Samuel 11-12).\r\n\r\nv.1 There is a difference between a transgression and a sin. A sin isn't always a willful act. \r\n\r\nSin means \"to miss the mark.\" The mark is perfection, and all of us have missed it. A transgression is a **willful** missing of the mark, deliberate disobedience.\r\n\r\n> 1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> 11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.\r\n\r\n## Psalm 34\r\n\r\n> [TITLE] A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.\r\n\r\n(1 Samuel 21:10-15)\r\n\r\n> 1 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. 2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. 3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.\r\n\r\nAlso, we see a prophetic statement concerning Christ (John 19:33,36):\r\n\r\n20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.\r\n\r\n## Psalm 40\r\n\r\n> [TITLE] To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.\r\n\r\n> 1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. 3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.\r\n\r\nv.5 too many to number!\r\n\r\nv. 6 \"mine ears hast thou opened\" refers to becoming a bondslave, or servant by choice, to the Lord. The bondslave had his ear pierced as a sign of this voluntary commitment.\r\n\r\nv. 7 of Christ (Luke 24:27)\r\n\r\n> 16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.\r\n\r\n- magnified: to make great; celebrate in praise; glorify\r\n\r\n> Psalm 69:30 &mdash; I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n- Is God getting ALL the glory?\r\n\r\n## Psalm 68\r\n\r\n> 15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan. 16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.\r\n\r\nPraising God for His choice or selection of Zion as His dwelling place.\r\n\r\nBashan is an eminent mountain, far exceeding Zion in height. Zion was not a \"high hill\", but Bashan is not so glorious!\r\n\r\n## Psalm 41\r\n\r\n> 13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.\r\n\r\n## Psalm 92\r\n\r\n> 1 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:\r\n\r\n## Psalm 107\r\n\r\n> 2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;\r\n\r\n## Psalm 116\r\n\r\nRead vs. 12-19.\r\n\r\n> 12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?\r\n\r\n## Psalm 138\r\n\r\n> 8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.\r\n\r\n## Psalm 65\r\n\r\n> Psalm 65:9 &mdash; Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.\r\n\r\n## Psalm 67\r\n\r\n> 7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.\r\n\r\n## Psalm 118\r\n\r\nJesus probably sang this psalm with His disciples on the night of the Passover feast. vs. 19 and 20 may reference Christ's triumpahl entry to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nRead vs 21- 24\r\n\r\n> 24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.\r\n\r\n## Psalm 124 \r\n\r\n> Psalm 124:7,8 &mdash; 7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.\r\n\r\n> 2 Corinthians 1:10 &mdash; Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;"}
