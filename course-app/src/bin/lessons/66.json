The word Church is used today to refer to the buildings that the saints gather in to worship&#44; but it more accurately refers to the people. The Scripture uses the word Church to refer to an assembly in a certain house or city. (Romans 16:5&#44; I Cor. 16:19&#44; Col. 4:15) The Church is more than a houseor building&#44; but is the saints who are the Body of Christ.\n\n##### The Lord added to the Church.\n\n> Acts 2:47 &hellip;  <!-- scripture:Acts 2:47-->\n\nAfter experiencing the great Baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Upper Room&#44; the Disciples were powerfully influential in witnessing of Christ. In one day&#44; 3&#44;000 souls were saved and added to the local assembly. Every day&#44; more and more were added!\n\n##### Jesus is the head of the Church.\n\n> Ephesians1:22&mdash;And hath put all things under his feet&#44; and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church&#44; Which is his body&hellip;\n\nThe Church is referred to in thisScripture as the body of Christ. Jesus is the head of His Body. In a physical body the head gives commands to the body to function and work. In the body ofChrist&#44; Jesus is the Commander who gives instructions to His Church to do the work of God.\n\n##### The Church consists of Believers who have been baptized in the Holy Ghost\n\n> 1 Corinthians 12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body&hellip;\n\nAccording to Ephesians 1: 22&#44;23&#44;the Church is the Body of Christ. I Corinthians 12:13 tells us that we are baptized into the Body by the Holy Spirit. According to this Scripture&#44; we understand that it takes the baptism or infilling of the Holy Ghost to do the work of God as part of the Body of Christ. \n\nIn summary:\n\n1. We are saved by the Blood of Jesus Christ.\n\n> Colossians 1:14 In whom we have redemption through his blood&#44; even the forgiveness of sins.</blockquote>\n\n2. A physical Church is a local assembly of Believers who gather together for worship.\n\n3. Yet&#44; according to I Corinthians 12:13&#44; we need the Holy Ghost Baptism to be active in the mystical Body/Church of Christ.\n\nThis Church is not the physical one&#44; but spiritual. We are born into the family of God and we are baptized bythe Holy Ghost into the Body or Church of Christ. The Body or Church enjoys a deeper relationship with Christ than that of the family relationship when weare born of God.\n\n4. The Church began on the day of Pentecost. \n\n> Acts 2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come&#44; they were all with one accord in one place. \n\nThe Church was birthed by the Holy Ghost on the Day of Pentecost. This class will include the study of the earlyChurch of Acts up to our current Church period.\n\n#### History &mdash; the word history comes from a word that means learning by inquiry.\n\n##### The Webster&apos;s dictionary defines history as: that branch of knowledge which deals with events that have taken place in the world&apos;s existence; the study or investigation of the past.\n\n##### HIS STORY &mdash; The birth&#44; life&#44; death&#44; and resurrection of Christ is thecentral event of the history of the world. History is recorded around Christ;dates are listed as BC (before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini) which is Latin thatmeans in the year of our Lord. All of history centers on Christ.\n\n#### Christian &mdash; We are studying the history of the Christian Church.\n\n##### The term Christian meaning to be like Christ or one who follows Christ was first used in Antioch around AD 40."}
