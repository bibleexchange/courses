This course is written knowing that ongoing study with its additions&#44; revisions&#44; enlargements&#44; and modifications is necessary.</p>\r\n<h3>Unifying</h3>\r\n<p>It is important that our study be motivated by a passion for the Scriptures and our Lord. Any other motive will cause our learning only to be divisive and destructive. Any truth learned and applied is an awesome blessing and no cause for boasting. Remember that because our knowledge and understanding is fluid we must use much grace when Christian&apos;s disagree on doctrinal points. No person or church has a monopoly on God and it is dangerous to study and present the Scriptures as if you are the only one who is right.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Ephesians 4:3&#44;13 -- Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith&#44; and of the knowledge of the Son of God&#44; unto a perfect man&#44; unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</blockquote>\r\n<h2>Personal Qualifications for this Course</h2><ol>\r\n<li>The ardent love of truth for its own sake.</li>\r\n<li>The supreme and disinterested love of God.</li>\r\n<li>An intense desire to know more of God.</li>\r\n<li>A strong desire to make Him known to others and a willingness to make any personal sacrifice for this end.</li>\r\n<li>A sense of ignorance and dependence upon Divine teaching and such humility as to be willing to expose your ignorance.</li>\r\n<li>A willingness to apply and practice as fast as you learn.</li>\r\n<li>A fixed purpose to know and do the whole truth which is the will of God.</li>\r\n<li>A state of mind that will not be diverted to make provision for the flesh.</li>\r\n<li>Docility of mind.
