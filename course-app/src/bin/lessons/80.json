This chapter also emphasizes that the Law of God is holy.\r\n\r\n### Division: Three Sections:\r\n\r\n#### Verses 1&ndash;6: Died that You May be Married to Another\r\n\r\n#### Verses 7&ndash;13: The Law is Holy, And Just and Good\r\n\r\n#### Verses 14&ndash;25: Paul&apos;s Captivity to the Law of Sin\r\n\r\n## Dead that You May be Married to Another (vs. 1-6)\r\n\r\n> Romans 7:1&mdash;Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?\r\n\r\n### Meaning of the Illustration\r\n\r\nThe sinner is in a binding relationship to his sin as a wife to a husband. So, long as they both live, the husband and wife are bound to each other under God. As the wife is in submission to her husband, so the sinner is under the dominion of the law of sin.\r\n\r\nPaul announces a death! The death of self in it being crucified with Christ opens a whole new world of opportunity. As the wife would be free from the law of her husband by death, so the sinner is freed from the law of sin through sharing in Christ&apos;s death. This death is the crucifixion of the old man with Christ. ( Ac 13:38-39; Rom. 3:25; 5:21; 6:6; 7:4; 2Co 5:15; Gal. 1:4; 2:20; 5:24; 6:14; Eph 4:22; 5:2; Col 2:11; 3:5,9; Titus 2:14; Heb 9:15; 1Pe1:21; 4:2; 1John 2:2; 4:10)\r\n\r\nRaised then in resurrection, we share in Christ&apos;s life that we might be married to another. In this second marriage, we are united with Christ.\r\n\r\n### The Power of the law is terminated\r\n\r\nAs long as a person is LIVING in sin they are under the law. The Sinner has no choice but to be under the law, except if he die to his sinfulness. The law dominates the sinner. The person that lives in sin is under the law\r\n\r\nDeath dissolves the legal obligation of the marriage. The sinner can be free from the power of sin and the penalty of the broken law.\r\n\r\n> Romans 7:4&mdash;We must &quot;become dead to the law by the body of Christ&quot;\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> Romans 6:14&mdash;sin shall not have dominion&hellip;ye are not under the law, but under grace.\r\n\r\n#### Between the mind and the carnal works of the flesh.\r\n#### Between my will and the old unregenerate self\r\n#### Between my soul and sinfulness\r\n### The Difference of the Union with Jesus Christ\r\n\r\n1. &quot;Know ye not &quot; The old life is baptized into His death 6:3\r\n2. &quot;Know ye not&quot; The old service is broken off, destroyed through Christ. 6:16\r\n3. &quot;Know ye not&quot; The old union is impossible with the new union with Christ. 7:1\r\n\r\n### The Service of the Union with Jesus Christ\r\n\r\nFrom this union with Christ will come our service to Christ.\r\n\r\n> Romans 7:6&mdash; But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.\r\n\r\n#### Serve with newness of life\t6:4\r\n#### Serve in newness of Spirit\t7:6\r\n#### Serve with new power Ro.1:16; 8:11; 1Co 6:14; 2Co 13:4; II Thess.1:11\r\n#### Serve as a new creature II Cor. 5:17; Gal.6:15\r\n\r\n### The Fruitfulness of this Union\r\n\r\nUnion with Christ enables us to bring forth fruit.\r\n\r\n#### Our union with sin disabled us unto death.\r\n\r\nRom.1:32; 6:21; 7:5; Gal.5:19-21\r\n\r\n#### Union with Christ enables us to bring forth fruit of Righteousness unto Holiness.\r\n\r\n- Under Sin\r\n\r\nAs long as a person lives in sin brings forth fruit unto death. 7:5\r\n\r\n- With Christ\r\n\r\n\"fruit unto God\"\r\n\r\nRom.1:13; 5:3-5; 6:22; John 15:2,4,5,8,16; I Cor. 1:6; Gal. 5:22-23; Eph 5:9; Php 1:11; 4:17; Col 1:6,10; Titus 3:14; Heb. 12:11; 13:15; James 3:18; 5:7; II Pe. 1:3-9\r\n"}
