It is the idea that God is three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. All three are equal parts of God, but separate persons. The word trinity is not in the Bible but the idea of the triune God is. All through the Bible we can see evidence that supports the trinity. The purpose of this writing is to prove from the Bible that the trinity is sound doctrine and is indeed a fact.\r\n\r\nAnything that contradicts the word of God is in error. It is very important that we know what we believe and we understand why we believe it. Our beliefs must be based on the Bible or they are merely the ideas of men. When the ideas of men contradict the Bible they are wrong.\r\n\r\nThe bible is infallible and the perfect word of God. Scripture must agree with scripture. We cannot take one verse out of the Bible and make a doctrine out of it. So in order to have sound doctrine we must compare scripture with scripture. The ideas that are presented here are backed with scripture and agree with the whole word of God.\r\n\r\n## There Are Three in Heaven\r\n\r\n> For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.&mdash;1 John 5:7\r\n\r\n## Jesus Was Sent by the Father\r\n\r\nIt is evident I hope that one cannot send himself. To be sent is to have directions from someone else. Jesus was sent by the Father with a purpose and a mission (John 5:30, 36-37; John 6:39, 44, 57; John 8:16, 18, 29, 42; John 12:49; John 14:24; John 17:21, 25; John 20:21).\r\n\r\n## Jesus Did Not Come in His Own Name\r\n\r\nJesus came in the name of the Father (John 5:30, John 8:42, John 14:24, John 5:43).\r\n\r\n## No Man One Has Seen or Heard the Father\r\n\r\nNo one has seen or heard the Father, but men have seen and heard God. They saw Jesus, the son of the Father. Jesus is just as much God as the Father, but he is not the Father. There is a difference (John 1:18, John 5:37).\r\n\r\n## The Father and the Son Are One\r\n\r\nJohn 10:30, John 17:11, 21\r\n\r\n## The Father Has His Own Name\r\n\r\nJohn 17:11\r\n\r\n## The Father and the Son Have Separate Wills\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that they ever disagree. Both are all-knowing and sinless. They have the same desires, the same heart. When Jesus came to the earth he subjected his will to the Father. He came as a servant (John 5:30; Matthew 26:39, 42; Luke 22:42).\r\n\r\n## The Father Posseses a Son and the Son Posseses a Father\r\n\r\nThere is a father-son relationship between Jesus and the Father. When Jesus says \"my Father\" that shows possession. It is His Father, not any father, but His Father. When the Father says \"my son\" He is showing that He has a son (Matthew 7:21; Matthew 10:32; Matthew 10:33; Matthew 11:27; Matthew 12:50; Matthew 15:13; Matthew 16:17; Matthew 18:19, 35; Matthew 20:23; Matthew 24:36; Matthew 25:34; Matthew 26:29, 39, 42, 53; Mark 10:29; Luke 2:49; Luke 9:26, 59; Luke 10:22; Luke 14:26; Luke 16:27; Luke 22:29, 42; Luke 23:46; Luke 24:49; John 2:16; John 5:17, 30, 43; John 6:32, 65; John 8:16, 19, 28, 38, 49, 54, 56; John 10:15, 17-18, 25, 32; John 12:26-27; John 14:2, 7, 12-13, 20-21, 23-24, 26, 28; John 15:1, 8-10 , 15-16, 23-24; John 16:10, 26; John 17:24; John 18:11; John 20:21; Eph. 3:14; Hebrews 1:5; Rev. 2:27; Rev. 3:5; Rev. 3:21).\r\n\r\n## Christ Lives in Those Who Believe, but Not All Who Believe Have the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n> He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.&mdash;Acts 19:2\r\n\r\n## The Holy Ghost Was Sent by the Father\r\n\r\nLuke 24:49, Acts 1:4, Acts 2:33\r\n\r\n## The Son Sits at the Right Hand of the Father\r\n\r\nPs. 110:1, Matt. 22:44, Luke 16:5, Luke 20:42, Acts 2:33-34, Acts 7:55-56\r\n\r\n## The Son and the Father Are Both Present at the Same Time\r\n\r\n> And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.&mdash;Luke 3:22\r\n\r\n## The Son Was with the Father Before He Came to Earth\r\n\r\n> And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.&mdash;John 15:27\r\n\r\n## Scriptures Where God Is Plural\r\n\r\nGen. 1:26; Gen. 3:22; Gen. 11:7; Is. 6:8"}
