In Ro 7:5 he gives a general description of the state of a\nJew, in servitude to sin, considered as under mere law. In Ro 7:6 he\ngives a summary account of the state of a Christian, or believing\nJew, and the advantages he enjoys under the Gospel&mdash;Adam Clarke.</font></font></p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2\">\n<font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 12pt\">Paul\nnow moves from the law of sin and draws illustration from the Mosaic\nLaw. As a man is bound to is wife so long as they both live, so does\nthe law having binding power over a person as long as they live in\nthe flesh. Death looses a man or wife from their spouse and so death\nof the flesh looses an individual from the law of sin. We cannot\nserve God while in the flesh for we are bound by the law of nature to\nsin. The flesh is the enemy of God and cannot be made subservient to\nHim. The only freedom from sin is to be found in death of the carnal\nman. When he dies then are we free to marry another. </font></font>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2\">\n<font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 12pt\">Paul\ncompletes the chapter with a personal testimony to illustrate the\nsame principle. This is not Paul the Apostle&apos;s testimony per se but\nSaul of Tarsus&apos; testimony. He was a man that was blameless\nconcerning the law, but yet found sin to be his master. The things he\nwould like to do he could not, and the things that he did not want to\ndo he did. Paul isn&apos;t presenting this as the condition of the\nBeliever where we just have to sin a little every day. No! Paul cries\nout in testimony for deliverance. </font></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><i>O\nwretched man that I am! who shall </i></font></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><i><b>deliver</b></i></font></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><i>\nme from the body of this death?</i></font></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 12pt\">\nThat is he sees beyond this weak condition a promise of something\nbetter.</font></font></p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; orphans: 2; widows: 2\">\n<font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 12pt\">Adam\nClarke speaks concerning this twenty-fourth verse an interesting\nnote. &quot;&hellip;there seems to be here an allusion to an ancient custom\nof certain tyrants, who bound a dead body to a living man, and\nobliged him to carry it about, till the contagion from the putrid\nmass took away his life!&quot; Paul is painting a startling picture in\norder to awaken his readers to the reality of the gruesomeness of\nsin. This picture of a dead body bound to a man is the parallel to\nverse 25, </font></font><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font size=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><i>I\nthank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
