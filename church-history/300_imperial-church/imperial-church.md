# Three: The Imperial Church (AD 313—476)

From the Edict of Constantine to the Fall of Rome.

## Mixture and Pergamos

_Pergamos_ means "married." The church was infiltrated by paganism, and became married to the world (Rev. 2:12—17). This infiltration of paganism would be the beginning of what would become the Roman Catholic Church.

### "Dwellest where satan's seat is" (v. 13)

The Emperor's throne was in Rome. The popes would rule out of Rome. The popes sat in satan's seat of authority to rule the Roman Catholic Church. The word _imperial_ means "autocratic rule," which is a ruler with absolute power or authority.

### The doctrine of Balaam (v. 14)

Balaam cast a stumbling block before Israel. He gave council to entice Israel to sin (Num. 31:1). The Scripture refers to him teaching Israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication. This Scripture is describing the events that would take place in the Imperial Church period. Balaam was already dead at the time when John received the Book of Revelation in AD 100. The Scripture is referring to the false doctrine spirit associated with Balaam that would be prevalent in this church period. The eating of things sacrificed to idols is in reference to the Roman Catholic wafer that was eaten by the Catholics and sacrificed each week in the mass.

### Doctrine of Nicolaitans (v. 15)

Remember, the word _Nicolaitanes_ means "to rule over the laity." This Scripture is in reference to the Romanist clergy who ruled harshly over the people.

## Constantine

### Constantine's Cross

He battled Maxentius for the throne at theBattle of Milvan Bridge (AD 312). Constantine was outnumbered by the army ofMaxentius who also wanted the throne. The winner of this battle would be thenext Emperor of Rome. Constantine claimed to have a vision of a cross, inscribed with the words, "In this sign conquer." Constantine made this cross the symbol of his army, and had it placed on the shields of his men. Archeological evidence shows us this cross was the Egyptian ankh which is a cross with a loop on top. The ankh is the symbol for the sun God Ra. Baal is the sun God that was worshipped in the O.T. Constantine won the battle and became the Emperor of Rome. He was used of the devil to combine Christianity with baal worship. The cross he stood for was not the cross of Christianity, but the ankh of baal worship.

### Constantine made a profession of faith and a supposed conversion to Christianity

Many Christian historians have doubted the sincerity of his profession. Constantine continued to worship the sun God under the guise of Christianity. This mixing of paganism with Christianity would later become Roman Catholicism.

### Edict of Toleration. AD 313 (Edict of Constantine). An Edict is an official decree or document. This Edict granted freedom to all religions in the Empire ending the Roman persecution of Christianity. It restored to Christians property that had been seized during Diocletian's reign. Satan changed his tactics from persecution to infiltration.

### Constantine was the first historical pope. Constantine took the title of Pontifex Maximus, which is still the official title of the pope today. Peter was not the first pope. Paul's greeting to the Roman Church does not mention Peter as being there in Rome. — Romans 16:1—15 Don't you think if Peter was there leading the Roman Church as the Catholics claim he was that Paul would have made mention of him in his greeting to the Roman Church. The book of Acts places Peter in Jerusalem when the church began. Peter was at the council of Jerusalem in AD 48. He was in Jerusalem not Rome.

## Results of Toleration of the Church

### The persecution of Christians ended. Many people were deceived, and accepted another gospel of compromise. Christianity that flourished under persecution became worldly under government acceptance.

### Churches seized during persecution were restored. New churches were built. The Roman basilica became the pattern for elegant church buildings. The Basilica was a courtroom in the shape of a rectangle divided into isles by rows of pillars with a semi-circular platform at one end with seats for the officials. This is still the pattern today in theRoman Catholic Church. An example of this style of architecture is St. Peter'sBasilica in Rome.

### The official sacrifices ceased. The Roman citizens were no longer required to make sacrifices to pagan gods.

### Churches were supported by the state. The temples of the God s had been supported by the public treasury. This money was now given to the churches and theclergy.

### Clergy received special privileges. The Clergy became a wealthy class. Men desired these positions for the monetary gain and power associated with the position. Salvation was no longer a requirement to be part of the Clergy. Evil men were ruling the Roman Church.

### Baal worship was introduced into the Church. Pergamos means married. The church became married to paganism. Baal worship of the sun God would become the false worship of the Roman Catholic Church. According to tradition Nimrod established the pagan cult of baal worship. Semiramis Nimrod's mother who would marry her son became the "queen of heaven". Nimrod was supposed to have been reincarnated into baal, the sun God.

#### Baal the sun God and Ashteroth "the queen of heaven" were worshipped in the Old Testament. — Judges 2:13, 10:16, I Sam. 7:14, 12:Cakes were made tothe "queen of heaven"— Jer. 7:18, 44:17—1 You can see the parallel between the cakes and the catholic wafer. Mary is still referred to as the queen ofheaven in the Roman Catholic Church today.

#### Incense was also used in baal worship and is used today in Roman Catholicism.

#### Mother — infant idols (statues) became the representation of this pagan cult of baal worship. The catholic statues of Mary and the baby Jesus lookexactly like these ancient pagan idols. The idols even had halos which were a pagan symbol of the sun God. Today in the Roman Catholic Church youcan find statues of Mary and the baby Jesus adorned with these pagan halos. The artifacts of these ancient idols show the connection between baal worship and Roman Catholicism.

#### The cult spread around the world. This false religion was taken with thepeople after the dispersion of Babel. This idol worship spread from empire toempire and was passed down throughout the ages. The following Empires worshipped baal the sun God and the queen of heaven. Each Empire changed thereligion slightly, yet the common worship of the queen of heaven was stillevident.

Egypt — Isis and Horus the sun God.

Babylon — Ishtar and Marduk.

Persia — Astarte

Greece — Aphrodite and Zeus.

Rome — Venus and Jupiter.

Ephesus — Diana

## Fall of the Western Roman Empire.

### Constantine chose the Greek city of Byzantium for the new Capital and renamed it Constantinople. — AD 330. This increased the influence of the Roman bishop.The capital was now far away from Rome and the Empire was already in collapse. After Constantine's death the Roman bishop became the Pope.

### The division of the Empire soon followed the building of the new capital. One Emperor could no longer protect his vast domain. The Adriatic Sea formed a natural barrier between the two divisions of the Empire. In AD 395 The Empire was split into the Eastern and Western Empires.

### The Western Empire with Rome as its Capital survived until AD 476.

### The Eastern Empire with Constantinople as its Capital survived until AD 1453.This would become the Holy Roman Empire of the Middle Ages.(AD 500 - 1500)

## Christian Leaders of the Period

### Athanius (AD 296-373)

He was a defender of the faith in the Arian controversy. Arius the leader of this false teaching did not believein the Biblical doctrine of The Trinity. He became bishop of Alexandria in AD 325. He was exiled five times for his stand against Rome.

### John Chrysostom (AD 345-407)

He was referred to as "the golden mouth," because of his eloquence as a speaker. He was a mighty preacher, a statesman, and an able expositor of the Bible. He became bishop of Constantinople in AD 398. He was banished for his stand for truth, and he died in exile.

### Augustine (AD 354-430)

He became bishop of Hippo in North Africa in AD 39. He was a Chief defender of the faith in the Pelagian Controversy. This false teaching was promoted by Pelegius who did not believein original sin. Augustine developed a reputation as a preacher, teacher, and writer.

### Even though these men were a part of the Roman Church, they stood for the faith.

The exiles of these men indicate they were not popular with the Roman Church leaders. The Roman Church would eventually force out anyone that opposed their pagan lies.
