<h2><span lang="en">The Medieval Church was Characterized by Thyatira - 2:18-21</span><span lang="swa">Kanisa la zama za enzi kati lilifanana tabia naThiatira &mdash; 2:18-21 </span></h2>
<h3><span lang="en">The &quot;continual sacrifice&quot; of mass was part of the seduction of this period.</span><span lang="swa">&quot;Sadaka ya kutolewa misa daima&quot;ilikuwa sehemu ya kubembeleza kwa kipindi hiki.</span></h3>
<p><span lang="en">Roman Catholic doctrine states that Christ instituted the Eucharist as an atoning or propitiatory work. </span><span lang="swa">Kanunimuhimu ya Katoliki ya Roma inatamka kwamba Kristo aliweka Ekaristi kama sakramenti ya upatanisho au utaratibu wa kazi.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;The victim is one and the same:&hellip;only the manner of offering is different. And since in this divinesacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass&#44; the same Christ who offered himselfonce in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross is contained and offered inan unbloody manner... this sacrifice is truly propitiatory&quot; (Doctrinade ss. Missae sacrificio&#44; c. 2&#44; quoted in Catechism of the CatholicChurch&#44; 1367).[Christ instituted the Eucharist.] He did this in order toperpetuate the sacrifice of the Cross throughout the centuries until he shouldcome again. (1992 Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church)</span><span lang="swa">&quot;Muathirika niyule yule &hellip; ila njia ya kumtoa sadaka ni tofauti. Na kwa kuwa katika sadakahii takatifu inayoadhimishwa katika misa ni Kristo yule aliyejitoa mwenyewesiku moja altareni kwenye msalaba kwa kumwaga damu; amechukuliwa na kutolewabila umwagaji wa damu  sadaka hii ni upatanisho wa kweli&quot; (Doctrinadess. Missae sacrificio c.2 kama inayotajwa katika Kateksimu ya Kanisa Katoliki 1367) {Kristo aliiweka Ekaristi} Alifanya hivi ili kuendelezasadaka ya msalaba katika karne zote mpaka atakaporudi tena. (Katekisimuya mwaka 1992 ya Kanisa Katoliki la Roma). </span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Thyatira means continual sacrifice. This refers to the Roman Catholic mass or Eucharistic celebration. The mass became a continual sacrifice for the living and the dead. Roman Catholic doctrine claims that the wafer and wine literally turn into the body and blood of Jesus and must be &quot;perpetuallyoffered&quot; until His return for there to be atonement for sin. Although they would rather say that mass is not so much a &quot;continual sacrifice&quot; as a &quot;perpetual re&ndash;presenting&apos; of the blood and body of Christ&#44; they in practice denounce the sufficiency and sovereignty of Christ&apos;s work on the cross in requiring any further work.  We by faith receive the atoning work of Christ because his sacrificial death was sufficient. The keeping of the Lord&apos;s Supper is not an atoning work or propitiatory&#44; but is a memorial feast and act of obedience. Jesus offered Himself once and for all  (Heb. 7:27) and his death and resurrection are memorialized in communion. There is no propitiation necessary beyond Christ&apos;s ministry on the cross.</span><span lang="swa">Thiatira maanayake sadaka ya misa kutolewa daima. Hii inahusisha misa ya Kanisa la Katolikiau adhimisho la Ekaristi. Misa iligeuka kuwa sadaka ya kutolewa daima kwawalio hai na wafu. Kanuni ya Kanisa Katoliki au adhimisho la Roma linadaikwamba mkate na divai hugeuka mwili na damu halisi ya Yesu na ni lazimaitolewe milele hadi atakaporudi ili kuwepo na ondoleo la dhambi. Ingawawangeweza kusema kwamba misa siyo &quot;sadaka ya kutolewa daima&quot; ama &quot;kuwakilishamilele&quot; kwa mwili na damu ya Kristo wao katika hali halisi wanashutumuukamilifu na mamlaka ya kazi ya Kristo msalabani kwa kuhitaji kazi zaidi. Kwaimani tunapokea upatanisho wa kazi ya Kristo kwa sababu kwa kujitolea kufailitosha.. Kuendelea kuadhimisha karamu ya Bwana siyo kazi ya upatanisho auutaratibu wa kazi ila ni sherehe ya kumbukumbu na tendo la utii. Yesu alijitoamara moja tu basi &mdash; (Ebr. 7:27 na kifo chake na ufufuko vinakumbukwakatika Komunio. Hakuna utaratibu wa kazi hiyo ambao ni wa lazima mbele zaidi yahuduma ya Kristo katika msalaba.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="en">The light of God&apos;s Word was taken from the people. The dark ages were brought about directly by taking the Bible away from the people.

The Bible was either in the original languages or in Latin which few people could understand even if they had wanted to read it for themselves.</span><span lang="swa">Mwangawa neno la Mungu ulipotea katika jamii. Enzi za zama za giza zililetwa na kuondolewa kwa Biblia mikononimwa watu. Kanisa Katoliki lilifundisha kwamba ni wachungaji tu ndio wanaowezakuitafsiri Biblia.Watu wa kawaida walikatazwa kusoma Biblia&#44; Biblia ilikuwakatika lugha yake ya mwanzo au katika lugha ya Kilatini ambayo ni watuwachache waliokuwa wanaielewa hata kama walitaka kujisomea wenyewe.</span></h4>
