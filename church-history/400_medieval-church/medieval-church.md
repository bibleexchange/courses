# Four: The Medieval Church

(AD 476 — 1453) From the fall of Rome to the fall of Constantinople.

## The Medieval Church was Characterized by Thyatira (2:18&ndash;21)

### The "continual sacrifice" of mass was part of the seduction of this period

Roman Catholic doctrine states that Christ instituted the Eucharist as an atoning or propitiatory work.

"The victim is one and the same: …only the manner of offering is different. And since in this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, the same Christ who offered himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross is contained and offered in an unbloody manner… this sacrifice is truly propitiatory" (Doctrinade ss. Missae sacrificio, c. 2, quoted in Catechism of the CatholicChurch, 1367).\[Christ instituted the Eucharist.\] He did this in order to perpetuate the sacrifice of the Cross throughout the centuries until he should come again. (1992 Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church)

Thyatira means continual sacrifice. This refers to the Roman Catholic mass or Eucharistic celebration. The mass became a continual sacrifice for the living and the dead. Roman Catholic doctrine claims that the wafer and wine literally turn into the body and blood of Jesus and must be "perpetually offered" until His return for there to be atonement for sin. Although they would rather say that mass is not so much a "continual sacrifice" as a "perpetual re–presenting' of the blood and body of Christ, they in practice denounce the sufficiency and sovereignty of Christ's work on the cross in requiring any further work. We by faith receive the atoning work of Christ because his sacrificial death was sufficient. The keeping of the Lord's Supper is not an atoning work or propitiatory, but is a memorial feast and act of obedience. Jesus offered Himself once and for all (Heb. 7:27) and his death and resurrection are memorialized in communion. There is no propitiation necessary beyond Christ's ministry on the cross.

### The spirit that Jezebel carried seduced many believers to idolatry and fornication

> Revelation 2:20&mdash;…thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess,to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificedunto idols.

Notice it is the servants of Jesus who are being taught and seduced to commit fornication and idolatry.

Queen Jezebel was already dead at the time of this writing. This Scripture refers to the seductive and false worship spirit of Jezebel and not specifically the O.T. queen.

### There was a faithful remnant in this period (v. 19)

> Revelation 2:24&mdash;…unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine…

### Some in this church period were involved in good works of charity, service and faith, and were not a part of the Roman Catholic Church

There were several groups of people who were following the Word of God.

## The Medieval Church was covered by darkness

> Isaiah 9:19&mdash;Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened,

Roughly, the period from the 5th to 15th century is referred to as the "Dark Ages."

### Civilization and civility came to a halt

#### There was little or no advancement in literature, art, and science

There was much poverty and superstition filled the land. Barbarians raided Europe and killed many people. There were many people killed by the bubonic plague that swept the entire continent.

#### The light of God's Word was taken from the people

The dark ages were brought about directly by taking the Bible away from the people. The Roman church taught that only the priests could interpret the Bible. The common people were forbidden to read the Bible. The Bible was either in the original languages or in Latin which few people could understand even if they had wanted to read it for themselves.

#### The people were kept in darkness

The mass was said in Latin which no one could understand. Truth and science were suppressed by the Catholic Church. Galileo, the man who invented the telescope, was almost killed because what he observed through his telescope went against the official position of the Pope who was supposed to be infallible.

### The Roman Catholic Church dominated Europe

#### The leaders of the church were immoral

#### A church of idolatry and paganism controlled Europe throughout this period

### The Inquisition

The Inquisition was a special court set up in the 1200's to deal with the heretics. Anyone who disagreed with The Roman Catholic Church was deemed a heretic. The heretics were hunted down and brought to trial by the Catholics.

#### Many Christians were brutally killed and tortured

 Accused heretics were asked if the wafer turned into the literal body and blood of Jesus. This question became the test of loyalty to the Roman Church. True Christians who answered negative to this question were killed as heretics.

### The Holy Wars which are also called the Crusades lasted from 1095&ndash;1291 AD

#### These wars were an attempt by the Roman Church to retake the Holy Land from the Muslims

Rome convinced political rulers of Europe to lead the Crusades. The Muslims were gaining power in Europe. The Catholics wanted to drive the Muslims out of Jerusalem and reclaim the city for the pope.

#### The crusaders failed to free the Holy Land from the dominion of the Mohammedans

## The Medieval Church was contrasted by saints

### There were remnant groups in this period that were not part of the Roman Church

#### The Albigenes were located in Albi, France

They believed the New Testament provided the authority of their faith. They opposed the pope and the Roman Church. The Albigenes were fiercely persecuted by Pope Innocent III in 1208.

#### The Waldensians were located in France, Italy, and Switzerland

They were named after their leader Peter Waldo who had the Bible translated into the people's language. Waldo taught that Scripture is the authority of Christians. Their slogan was: The Word of God speaks, and we ought to obey it. The Waldensians were greatly persecuted by the Roman Church.

### Prominent leaders of the period

#### John Wycliffe

John Wycliffe (1330&ndash;1384) was the first to translate The Bible into English. He is referred to as the Morning Star of the Reformation. He stood against the Roman Church, and rejected the authority of the Pope. He would have been killed by the Catholics had it not been for the protection of the English nobles. Wycliffe's preaching and Bible translation prepared the way for The Reformation. The Catholics hated him so much his body was dug up and desecrated years after his death.

#### John Huss

John Huss (1369&ndash;1315) had been a reader of Wycliffe's writings and stood for the truth of the Word of God. He strongly opposed the Authority of the Pope and the lies of Romanism. He was condemned as a heretic and burned at the stake by a council of the Roman Catholic Church.
