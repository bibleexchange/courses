# One: The Apostolic Church

(AD 30—100) From the Day of Pentecost to the completion of the New Testament

## Ephesus means desirable (Rev. 2:1—7)

### Jesus had many good things to say about this church

### They left their first love

The loss of a love relationship with Jesus resulted in a loss of the love of the souls of men. There was no missionary effort. Jesus commissioned the Church to go into the entire world and preach the Gospel. The early church made no effort to evangelize the world.

### They hated the deeds of the Nicolaitanes

Nicolaitanes refers to those who wanted to rule or conquer the laity. This comes from two Greek words Niko which means to conquer or overthrow and Laos which means the people or laity.

## The Church's Enduement

### They received power, after the Holy Ghost came upon them (Acts 1:8)

### The effects of the Holy Spirit

#### Illuminating

The Holy Spirit illuminated their minds to understand what they were not able to understand before (Luke 24:45; John 12:16; John 16:13; I Cor. 2:14).

#### Empowering

The Holy Spirit empowered them to preach and to work miracles (Mark 16:20; Acts 6:15).

#### Abiding

The Holy Spirit came on the Day of Pentecost and will abide until the Church is raptured (As long as the Church is here the Holy Spirit will be here in the manner in which He came on the Day of Pentecost) (Acts 2:39).

## The Church's Original Location

### The Church began in the city ofJerusalem, but persecution would soon scatter them abroad (Acts 8:1)

## The Church's membership

The original members were all Jews. They didn't yet understand that the Gospel was also for the Gentiles (Acts 11:1—18).

## The Church's Government

### The twelve Apostles as a body governed the Church

### Peter was the spokesman (Acts 2:14, 38—42)

### James, the brother of Jesus, became the presiding elder or pastor (Acts 15:6—13, 21:18)

## The Church's Doctrines

### Jesus was the Messiah (Acts 2:36)

### The Resurrection of Christ (Acts 2:30—32)

### The Return of Christ (Acts 1:9—11; I Thess. 4:15—17)

## The Church's Defect

They lacked missionary vision, but persecution sent them forth (Acts 8:1).

## The Church's Expansion

### Stephen's preaching

He was one of the seven chosen to care for the needs of the church (Acts 6:8). He is described as a man full of faith and the Holy Ghost. He was used by God to do great wonders and miracles among the people. Stephen was the first Christian Martyr (Acts 7:55—60).

### Saul's persecution

Saul was a leader in persecuting the Christians (Acts 8:3). He was the one that consented to Stephen's death. The persecution helped to expand the church (Acts 8:4).

### Philip's preaching

He established a church in Samaria (Acts 8:14—17). This church was recognized by the Apostles. This was the first church outside of Judaism. He also founded churches in Gaza, Joppa, and Caesarea (Acts 8:40).

### Peter's preaching

Peter preached the Gospel in Cornelius' house. The Gentiles received the Holy Ghost while Peter was preaching (Acts 10:44—48).

### Saul's conversion

Jesus confronted Saul on the road to Damascus. He became a powerful preacher to both Jews and Gentiles (Acts 9:19—22). Saul's name was changed to Paul. Paul became the mighty apostle to the Gentiles.

### Paul's missionary journeys

Paul took several missionary journeys to spread the Gospel. Paul established churches at Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, and Corinth. He formed the seven churches of Asia either directly or indirectly (Acts 19:10). The churches were established though much suffering (II Cor. 11:23—28).

## The Church among the Gentiles

### The Council at Jerusalem AD 48 (Acts 15:5—20)

The Apostles called a council of elders together to settle the question of whether the Gentiles should keep the ceremonial Law of Moses. Some of the people were insisting that the Gentilesbe circumcised (vs. 5). The council concluded that the ceremonial Law was not binding on the Gentiles.

### The leaders of the Church (Gal. 2:9)

#### The Apostle Peter

The Apostle Peter was the spokesman among the Apostles. He assisted James at the Jerusalem Church. History records Peter was martyred in Rome about AD 67.

#### The Apostle Paul (Romans 11:13)

Paul was called to be an Apostle (Rom. 1:1). He was the Apostle to the Gentiles. He taught in the synagogues and received from the Holy Ghost much of the N.T. While a prisoner at Rome he wrote Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. History records Paul was martyred around AD 67.

#### James (Acts 15:13—20)

James was the younger brother of theLord. He is not to be confused with the Apostle James who was killed by Herod in Acts 12. "And he killed James the brother of John with the sword" (Acts 12:2). James was the presiding elder or pastor of the Jerusalem church. He recognized the Gentiles as part of the body of Christ. History records James was martyred around AD 62.

#### The Apostle John

John was the youngest of the Apostles. He arose as a leader after the death of the other original Apostles. John taught Ignatius and Polycarp who would become leaders of the Church. He received the Revelation of Jesus Christ while in exile on the isle of Patmos in AD 100. There is no accurate historical record of the death of John.

### The Fall of Jerusalem in AD 70

#### The Jews broke out in rebellion against Roman rule in AD 66

#### The Roman General Titus destroyed the city of Jerusalem

The city caught on fire which caused the gold to melt between the bricks. Soldiers took apart the temple brick by brick to retrieve the gold. This event fulfilled the prophecy of Jesus concerning the temple.

> Mark 13:2&mdash;And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

#### The animal sacrifices ceased when the temple was destroyed

#### God was done with Judaism
