### Obstacles to Missions

Doctrinal beliefs formerly hindered the evangelizing of heathen nations. The Calvinistic doctrines of predestination and election were common beliefs of the church leading up to and during this period. Heathen nations were believed to be predestined to be dammed with no hope of Salvation. It was because of the adherence to this false doctrine that it was thought to be unnecessary to travel to heathen nations.

### William Carey (India)

William Carey (1761&ndash;1834) was the father of the modern missionary movement. He was a poor Englishman. For a time, he walked 8 miles each Sunday to preach to a church. He tried to convince people to go preach in other countries, but they said, "If God wants to save the heathen, He will do so, without your help or mine."

He sailed for India in 1793. He was the first modern missionary to India. There, he saw no converts for seven years. He did not spend much time condemning the Hindu religion, but instead spent his time speaking about Jesus, His death, and His Resurrection. He was the first modern missionary that went to a foreign country for the purpose of evangelizing a heathen nation. He also formed the first missionary society. A famous saying of his is, "Expect great things from God; attempt great things for God."

### Adoniram Judson (Burma)

He got married on February 5, 1812, and within two weeks they were sailing for India from the United States. They started the trip working under the Congregationalists, but because Adoniram thought that the Congregationalists were wrong about baptism, he convinced his wife and another partner that was with them to become Baptists. He sent a letter of resignation when they arrived in India. The partner took the letter back, and went to try to raise money from the Baptists.

The government of India would not let them stay, and William Carey suggested that they should go to Burma. When they arrived in Burma, they started learning the language, opened a school for girls, and translated the New Testament. It was six years before they had their first convert. Adoniram spent two years in prison. Adoniram's wife, Ann, died at age 36. Judson established 63 churches, mostly among the Karen tribe.
