# Five: The Reformed Church

(AD 1453â€”1678) From the fall Constantinople to the end of the Thirty Year War.

## The Remnant

Sardis implies a remnant (Rev. 3:1&ndash;6).

### Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God (v. 2)

Jesus was encouraging the church to be alert and hang on to what remnant of the things of God were still left before they died out.

### Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, hold fast, and repent (v. 3)

They were told to remember and hold on to the truth they had received and to repent which means to turn around.

### Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments (v. 4)

There was still a remnant standing against the Roman Church. This was a period when God raised up men to shine the light against the darkness of the Roman Church.

## The Renaissance

### The Light of learning

The Renaissance is a term that refers to the awakening of Europe to an interest in literature, art, and science. These are things associated with civilization.

### The light of God's Word

The Word of God brought Europe out of the dark ages. It is not a coincidence that civilization was restored when the light of God's Word was also restored to the people.

The printing press was invented by Gutenberg in 1456 and the Bible was the first book printed. Bibles could now be massed produced and placed in the hands of the common people because of this invention.

### The Light of Truth

The movable type printing press became a powerful tool of The Reformation. The reformers printed books and pamphlets teaching against the lies of Romanism and the truths of justification by faith. These new pamphlets gained in popularity and were circulated throughout Europe. Books had to be hand copied by scribes before the printing press was invented, but now books could be circulated quickly. People could read for themselves and make decisions based on fact and not on the lies of Romanism.

## The Reformation

### Change within the Catholic Church

### Reform means to amend, change or improve

Reformers were trying to bring change to the church. Some of these reformers did not realize that the Roman Catholic Church was not going to change. They stood against the false teaching of Romanism. They were restoring the Bible into the languages of the people. The Catholic Church strongly opposed laymen reading the Bible. Those who stood for truth were persecuted and began to realize the false church of Rome was not going to change.

### Changing from darkness to light

People received the truth of salvation when they began to read the Bible for themselves. The light of the Gospel was driving back the darkness of Romanism. God was turning on the light to end the dark ages.

## The Reformers

God raised up torch bearers throughout the world to restore the light of the Gospel. Protestant is the namegiven to those who protested the Catholic Church.

### Reformers in Europe

#### Martin Luther (1483&ndash;1546) in Germany

#### Martin Luther is considered to be _the father of the Reformation_

He nailed 95 theses to the oak door of the Wittenberg Cathedral on Oct. 31, 151. The theses stated his position against the Roman Church. He refuted the false doctrine of Romanism and denied the infallibility of the pope. Printed copies quickly flooded Europe and helped to spark the light of the Reformation.

He burned the papal bull. Bull is derived from the Latin _bula_ which means "a seal." The name being applied to any document stamped with an official seal. In 1520, the pope sent Luther a bull accusing him of heresy. Luther burned the bull in the yard of the University of Wittenberg. Luther called it "the execrable bull of antichrist." This obviously did not go over well with the pope.

Luther was called to the Diet at Worms. A _Diet_ is a council of rulers. In June of 1521, Luther was called before an imperial diet at Worms in Germany. Luther had been guaranteed safe passage by the German nobles to and from the council. He was commanded to recant by the Roman church leaders. Luther replied, "Unless I am convinced by proofs from Scriptures or by plain and clear reasons and arguments, I can and will not retract, for it is neither safe nor wise to do anything against conscience. Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me. Amen."

Luther was secluded to WartburgCastle for one year. He was arrested and confined for his safety by the nobles. He translated the N. T. and part of the O. T. into the German language of his people.

#### Ulrich Zwingli (1484&ndash;1531) in Switzerland

He published works against theCatholics. He was killed in civil war and John Calvin carried on the work.

#### John Calvin (1509&ndash;1564) in France and Switzerland

John Calvin was an outspoken preacher and author who preached salvation by faith. He stressed the authority of Scripture. Calvin misinterpreted Scripture and taught the predestination of the elect. This teaching which is contrary to the Bible became to be known as Calvinism.

#### Jacques Lefevre (1455&ndash;1536) in France

He wrote a book called _Justification by faith_ (1512) and preached salvation by faith. The protestants in France were called Huguenots. The Huguenots were greatly persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church. Twenty thousand Protestants were killed by the Catholics in one day on Aug. 14, 1572, on what was referred to as the "St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre." Many protestant leaders were killed in this massacre. Five-hundred thousand Protestants fled the country for their own safety.

### Reformers in England & Scotland

#### John Wycliffe (c. 1320&ndash;1384) in England

John Wycliffe had already made an impact on England. The Wycliffe Bible was in the hands of the people. His teachings had spread across England. The light of the Word in the hands of the people provided fertile ground for the Reformation in England.

#### Puritans and Separatists in England

King Henry VIII (1491&ndash;1547) drove the Roman Catholic Church out of England and formed the Church of England. The Church of England then became the official state church. Ministers and churches were then required to be licensed by the state. It was this English Church that caused problems for the Christians in England. The persecution was not as severe as that of the Catholics in Europe, but those who opposed the official State Church were called dissenters. Many of these dissenters especially the non-licensed preachers were put into prison. There were two groups that formed among the dissenters. Separatists were those who wanted to separate from the Church of England. Puritans were those who wanted to purify the Church of England.

#### John Bunyan (1628&ndash;1688) in England

John Bunyan was a powerful preacher of the Gospel among the dissenters. He preached salvation by grace through faith in Jesus. Bunyan preached without State sanction and spent 12 years in jail for preaching the Gospel. He wrote _Pilgrim's Progress_ while he was in jail, and it is still in print today.

#### John Knox (c. 1510&ndash;1572) in Scotland

He stood strong againstCatholicism. Knox fervent prayer became "Give me Scotland, or I die."" He strongly opposed Mary Queen of Scots who was a Roman Catholic. He led parliament to outlaw the Catholic mass in 1560. The Protestant Church inScotland called the Presbyterian Church became the official state church in 1567.

### Reformers in the "New World" (America)

The Pilgrims who came to the New World were Separatists from England. They landed in the New World in the fall of 1620. They came for religious freedom from the oppression of the Church of England. They formed the Mayflower Compact which was the first document of self-government of the New World. The Mayflower Compact based upon Biblical principals was the foundation for the Constitution of the U.S.A.

## The Reformed Priests (Jesuits)

Initially known as "reformed priests," the Jesuits traveled with their elected Superior General Ignatius of Loyola to Rome where they offered their services to the pope in October 1534.

Before being dispersed on various missions for Pope Paul III, the pope established a papal bull Regiminimilitantis Ecclesiae (Latin for To the Government of the Church Militant) declaring official approval of the Jesuits who are still in existence today. The Jesuits led a counter reformation against the Protestants.
