# Seven: The Postmodern Church

(AD c. 1950â€”PRESENT) From the 1950's till the present time

## Church of lukewarmness and casting votes (3:14&ndash;22)

### The church is described by Jesus as being lukewarm

This is a prophetic description of the current church period. The church as a whole today is in a backslidden condition and does not even know it! The church thinks they are doing well, but Jesus' description of the church today is far from desirable.

> Revelation 3:17&mdash;thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.

### The church is run by the ballot box.

Laodicea means rule by the people. Many of the churches today are run by the people. The name of this period describes the government of this period. The church is no longer being led by God instead they are running things themselves and doing things their own way.

## Church of liberalism and compromise

### New Evangelicals

The term _New Evangelicals_ was a phrase coined to describe those who promoted a modern religion of compromise. There was a new wave of liberalism that crept into the church.

New Evangelicals believe there are errors in the Bible. Some even denied Christ's deity. They compromised with sin, substituting worldliness for the things of God.

## Church of Charisma

The modern charismatic spirit is a false spirit.

### There is a false anointing (Matt. 24:5)

Jesus warned there would be false christs in the last days. The word Christ means anointed. There are many today with a false anointing that is not of God.

### There are false prophets (Matt. 24:11, 24)

Jesus said there would be false prophets that would deceive many. There are many false prophets today in the charismatic movement. They replace the unction of the Holy Ghost with eloquence and operating under demon power.

### The charismatic movement came out of the Catholic Church

## Church of Luxury & Corruption

### The gospel of prosperity has replaced the Gospel of Jesus Christ in many of our modern churches

Many in the church today are preaching a prosperity gospel of monetary gain. This is a description of the blab-it-and-grab-it mentality of many of our modern day televangelists.

The emphasis is on wealth and monetary gain. Gimmicks are being used to raise money. People are told such slogans as,  "plant your seed for your greatest need. They are told if they give they will receive the hundred fold blessing. They are told to speak their blessing into existence and claim their Cadillac. Some even tell people to talk to their wallets for the purpose of speaking money into them.

### Gullible Christians swallow up every new fad regardless of truth

The Book _Jabez Prayer_ is full of false doctrine. This book has gained tremendous popularity today by promising untold wealth and blessing. The prayer is taken out of context and used as a mantra to command God to pour out His blessings.

### Making Merchandise of the Gospel

## CONCLUSION: The church is in a lukewarm condition.

### Much of the church is asleep

### There is much worldliness and compromise in the churches today
