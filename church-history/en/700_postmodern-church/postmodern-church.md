# Seven: The Postmodern Church (AD c. 1950â€“PRESENT)

From the 1950's till the present time

## Church of lukewarmness and casting votes (3:14&ndash;22)

### The church is described by Jesus as being lukewarm

This is a prophetic description of the current church period. The church as a whole today is in a backslidden condition and does not even know it! The church thinks they are doing well, but Jesus' description of the church today is far from desirable.

> Revelation 3:17&mdash;thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.

### The church is run by the ballot box.

Laodicea means rule by the people. Many of the churches today are run by the people. The name of this period describes the government of this period. The church is no longer being led by God instead they are running things themselves and doing things their own way.

## Church of charisma

### There is a false anointing (Matt. 24:5)

Jesus warned there would be false christs in the last days. The word Christ means anointed. There are many today with a false anointing that is not of God.

### There are false prophets (Matt. 24:11, 24)

Jesus said there would be false prophets that would deceive many. There are many false prophets today in the charismatic movement. They replace the unction of the Holy Ghost with eloquence.

### The charismatic movement came out of the Catholic Church

## Church of Luxury & Corruption

### The gospel of prosperity has replaced the Gospel of Jesus Christ in many of our modern churches

Many in the church today are preaching a prosperity gospel of monetary gain. People are told such slogans as, "plant your seed for your greatest need." They are told if they give they will receive the hundred fold blessing. They are told to speak their blessing into existence.
