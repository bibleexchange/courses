### Why study church history?

#### The study of church history gives us an appreciation of our heritage

Many men and woman have paid the price of their lives to carry this Gospel message. The Gospel has been preached through much difficulty and hardship.

#### The repeat of history

History comes in cycles. By studying the past we can learn about the present. We can learn from the mistakes and successes of others. God is no respecter of persons. What God has performed for past generations He can do for our generation if we obey Him as they did.

> Romans 2:11&mdash;For there is no respect of persons with God.

God deals with all men equally in all ages and at all times. How God dealt with men in times past is how He will still deal with men today. God has always required that men live a holy life and he has not changed that standard today.

##### God uses ordinary people

The God that used Peter, and James, and John is the same God that will use you. God uses ordinary people just like you.

There have been some great manifestations of God's power throughout the course of the history of the Church. The same Holy Ghost that moved in those revivals is the same Holy Ghost that will move today.

##### You can see that God's hand has always been on His church

#### To enrich the knowledge of the minister
