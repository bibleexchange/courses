# Introduction to Church History

Jesus said: &quot;upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&quot; (Matthew 16:18). Jesus is talking to Peter, but Peter is not the rock foundation of the church. Jesus is the rock upon which the church is built! Jesus is the stone which the builder's rejected, and the chief cornerstone.

> Acts 4:11 &mdash;This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.

This class will help the student to become familiar with the history of the church. The goal of this class is to give you a practical understanding of events that occurred throughout the history of the church. The church of Jesus Christ is alive. We will study the lives of some of the people who have been used of God as pillars in the church.
