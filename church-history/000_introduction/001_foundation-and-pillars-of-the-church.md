Jesus said: &quot;upon this rock I will build My Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&quot; &mdash;Matthew 16:18. Jesus is talking to Peter&#44; but Peter is not the rock foundation of the Church. JESUS IS THE ROCK UPON WHICH THE CHURCH IS BUILT! Jesus is the stone which the builder&apos;s rejected&#44; and the chief cornerstone.

> Acts 4:11 &mdash; <!-- scripture:Acts 4:11-->
