# Two: The Persecuted Church (AD 100—313)

From the completion of the NT to the Edict of Constantine.

This sets forth the period when the church was crushed beneath the iron heel of pagan Rome, yet it never gave out such sweet fragrance to God as in those two centuries of almost constant martyrdom. The Edict of Constantine was an official decree that ended the killing of Christians in the Roman Empire. Constantine will be further discussed in the Imperial Church Period.

We have record of events of the first church period from the Bible, which we believe is inspired. We do not have biblical record for any other church period. This means that not all accounts that we will read are necessarily true. Two people can witness the same event and yet give completely different accounts of it. History is complicated because the sources may or may not be true. There is a saying, "history is written by the victors." This is because those that lost the battle were gone, and they were not able to write their own account of what happened.

## Persecution and Smyrna

_Smyrna_ means "crushed." It comes from the root word myrrh, the myrrh plant had to be crushed in order to emit its sweet fragrance (Revelation 2:8—11). It is said that when Polycarp died in the flames, that there was a pleasant aroma.

### The Scripture describes "tribulation and poverty"

This was an intense period of persecution of the church. Those who weren't killed were forced into hiding and endured poverty and hardship.

### "the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan." (Rev. 2:9)

The Judiazers opposed the church. The Judiazers were those who wanted to revert back to the ceremonial law. Jesus exposes these false Jews as belonging to the synagogue of Satan.

### "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer"

Jesus foretold of the suffering of this period. Jesus encourages the saints not to fear. This is a prophecy of the suffering that was to come to the church.

### "the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried"

Many were imprisoned for the sake of the Gospel during this period. It became against the Roman law to be a Christian.

### "ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life" (Rev. 2:10)

This is a prophecy of the ten periods of persecution that were to come in the Smyrna period. As these letters to the seven churches are compared to the events of church history you can see the prophetic parallel unfold. There were ten intense periods of persecution at the hands of Roman emperors. Many Christians gave their lives for the Gospel to receive what is called a martyrs crown.

## Causes of imperial persecutions

### Heathen worship was hospitable to new gods while Christianity was exclusive to the worship of the one true God

New gods were accepted by the heathen culture of Rome. Christians could not condone worship of false gods and would not accept the way of the heathen.

### Idol worship was interwoven with life

Images stood in many houses to receive adoration. Sacrifices were made to gods at festivals. Images were worshiped at civil ceremonies. Christians who took no part in such idolatry were not fitting in with the pagan society. Because Christians did not participate in the public pagan worship ceremonies, many people did not think that they worshiped at all and that they were atheists.

### Emperor worship

Christians would not worship the emperor. Christians spoke of another King. Christians were looked upon as being disloyal and plotters of a revolution.

### Judaism had been an allowed religion in the Roman Empire

In the first century Christians had been considered a sect of Judaism, an allowed religion. After the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, Christianity stood alone with no laws to protect them.

### Secret meetings

The Christians started to meet in secret to protect themselves from persecution. The secret meetings of Christians aroused suspicion. They were accused of meeting in secret to plan an overthrow of the Empire. Because of the Lord's Supper and talk about eating the body of Christ, some people thought that they were cannibals.

### Equality in the church

Christians looked upon all men as equal, thus destroying the social order of the nobles. This went against the order of Roman society.

### Business interests

Christianity meant an end to the profitable business of making idols. The craftsmen supported the persecution of the Christians (Acts 19:24—28).

## The Stages of Persecution

### The church experienced ten periods of intense persecution at the hands of Roman emperors

"Ye shall have tribulation ten days" (Rev. 2:10). Christianity was outlawed during all of the second and third centuries. There was tremendous persecution in the opening years of the fourth century, until the year AD 313 when the _Edict of Constantine_ was issued.

### In AD 303 the Emperor Diocletian began the tenth and fiercest persecution of Christians that is called "The Great Persecution."

This was an attempt to remove Christianity from the face of the earth. It is said that Diocletian erected a pillar inscribed, "In honor of the extirpation of the Christian superstition." Many Christians were burned alive for their testimony. Christians were eaten by wild beasts in the arena. The beasts became sick of human flesh and would no longer attack. Soldiers became weary of killing helpless, unarmed people and threw their swords away.

## Prominent Martyrs and leaders of the Persecuted Church

### Ignatius 

Ignatius was bishop of Antioch in Syria. He had been a pupil of the Apostle John that became a powerful preacher of the Gospel.

Ignatius was thrown to the wild beasts in the Coliseum. Standing in the arena as the lions approached him, Ignatius prayed, "I thank Thee O Lord, thatThou hast vouchsafed thus to honor me. I am God's grain, to be Ground between the teeth of wild beasts, so that I may become a holy loaf for the Lord."

### Justin Martyr

Justin Martyr was a philosopher who became a Christian after meeting an elderly man who explained how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. He was one of the first apologists, which is someone who uses reason and logic to defend his faith. He wrote several books which are still in existence that give us much information about this period. One of his prominent works is _Dialogue with Trypho_, a treatise refuting the Judiazers (Rev. 2:9).

He once wrote, "You can kill us, but cannot do us any real harm." He was beheaded in Rome in AD 165. His last words were, "I am a Christian, having been freed by Christ, and by the grace of Christ, I partake of the same hope."

### Polycarp

Polycarp was bishop of Smyrna at Asia Minor. He was taught as a youth by the Apostle John. When the police came to arrest him, he treated them as guests. He fed them and asked for an hour to pray, but he took two hours.

They brought Polycarp to the proconsul, who threatened to burn him alive with fire if he would not deny Christ. Polycarp answered, "Eighty and six years have I served Christ, and He has done me no wrong; how then can I blaspheme my King who has saved me? You threaten the fire that burns for an hour and then is quenched; but you know not of the fire of the judgment to come, and not of the fire of the eternal punishment. Bring what you will."

The proconsul pleaded with him to say, "Away with the atheists!" (meaning the Christians), so that they could let him go free. Polycarp turned to the crowd that was watching and motioned to them while saying, "Away with the atheists!" Because he would not recant his Christian beliefs, he was burned alive in Smyrna in AD 155. Polycarp was the last link to the Apostolic Church.

### Ireneus

Ireneus was a student of Polycarp. He became bishop of Lyons (in Gaul) in AD 177. He stressed the fundamental Christian doctrines which were facing opposition from the Gnostics. The Gnostics believed in "secret knowledge" that only some believers would receive, but Ireneus reminded them that the Apostles taught in the open and not in secret. Some of his writings still survive today.

### Origin

### Tertullian

### Simeon

Simeon was James' successor as head of the Jerusalem church. He was crucified by order of the Roman governor of Palestine in AD 107 during Trajan's reign.

### Blandina

Blandina was a Christian slave girl who was tortured from morning until night declared, "I am a Christian, and no evil is committed among us."

### Perpetua and Felicitas

A noble lady in Carthage, Perpetua, and her slave, Felicitas, were killed by wild beasts in AD 203.

## Formation of the New Testament Canon

The word _canon_ means "a rod, rule or measuring device."

Refers to the Biblical books that were judged to be of divine origin (_inspired_ means "God breathed") and included as part of the Bible.

No precise date can be given for the full recognition of the New Testament Canon, but it cannot be placed earlier than AD 300.

## False teaching arose during this period

### Gnostics taught that people could be saved by secret knowledge 

Gnosisis a Greek word for knowledge.

### Ebionites/Judiazers continued in the ceremonial Law of Moses, and were trying to influence others to do the same

## Condition of the Church

### The church was purified through persecution

### There was a unity among the brethren

### The persecuted church was a growing church

The devil sought to destroy Christianity through persecution, but persecution only served to fan the flame of Christianity as the Gospel spread throughout the known world.
