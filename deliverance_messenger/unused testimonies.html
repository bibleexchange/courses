		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs78AB3212">I was saved off the streets of Portland approximately ten years ago in September. &nbsp;The Lord brought me out of deep sin and placed me in a Christian home on Munjoy Hill for about two years. &nbsp;For about seven years, I was involved in a ministry that helped street people in Portland. &nbsp;I left that ministry and moved to Windham. &nbsp;While in Windham, I attended various churches while working in Portland. &nbsp;I never felt totally comfortable in any of the churches and I began to search for God&rsquo;s will in my life. &nbsp;One day, while in a Christian bookstore in Scarborough, I saw a poster advertising the Deliverance Center&rsquo;s spring convention. &nbsp;I went to the meetings and when Pastor Reynolds asked if anyone had a desire to attend the school, I felt God call me to Bible school. &nbsp;I started Bible school in Oct. 2003 and in about two weeks, God willing, I will graduate. &nbsp;God has blessed me mightily in the years of school. &nbsp;I know it was the hand of God that has kept me and helped during the three years. &nbsp;I want to make myself available and obedient to do God&rsquo;s will the rest of my life.</span></p><p class="cs1157FFE2"><span class="csA79A1717">Steven Mason</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs78AB3212">In the middle of the spring of the year 2006, I was working on a metal building. &nbsp;Two other workers and I were working on a metal staging approximately 20&rsquo; high. &nbsp;I saw a wire sticking out of the wall and asked one of my fellow workers if it was a live wire. &nbsp;He said it was and to be very careful. &nbsp;About a couple of hours went by and by that time I had forgotten about the wire. &nbsp;I was working just below it, putting a metal stud in place, when the top of the stud touched the wire producing a shower of sparks. &nbsp;I asked one of the other workers why I wasn&rsquo;t electrocuted and they pointed out that the bottom end of the stud had been resting on the metal beam, grounding it. &nbsp;The electricity had gone through the stud and into the beam instead of into me. &nbsp;I said, &ldquo;Wow, Thank you Jesus for we could have been electrocuted, fallen off the staging and died.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA79A1717">Victor Rios</span></p></body>
