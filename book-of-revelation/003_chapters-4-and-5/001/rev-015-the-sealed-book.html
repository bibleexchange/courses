<h1>The Sealed Book, vs. 1-4</h1>

<p>This chapter continues the description of the vision in chapter four. The scene is still the throne, the Elders, the Living creatures.</p>
	<p>This prophecy is in connection with the Church, but not of the Church. Also, this prophecy has its description given in Heaven, but its fulfillment on the earth.</p>

<h2>The Position of the Book</h2>
<h3>v. 1 "In the right hand"</h3>
<p>The place of power.</p>
<h3>v. 1 "Of Him that sat on the throne."</h3>
<p>The place of rule of authority.</p>
<h2>The Characteristics of the Book</h2>
<h3>v. 1 "A book written within"</h3>
<p>A scroll - about judgment</p>
<p>The book contained a revelation and demonstration of things to come at the consummation of this present age after the Rapture of the Church.</p>
<h3>v. 1 "On the backside, sealed with seven seals"</h3>
<p>Reserved judgment. This is not a familiar judgment seen. This is an exceptional administration of justice never before witnessed.</p>
<blockquote>Reserved unto the Day of Judgment</blockquote>
<h2>The Dignity of the Book</h2>
<h3>The question by the angel</h3>
<blockquote>v. 2 "Who is worthy to open the book"</blockquote>
<h3>The answer to the question</h3>
<blockquote>v. 3 "No man in heaven, or in earth, neither under the earth,was able to open the book, neither to look therein."</blockquote>
<p>Notice also that this "strong" angel is not able to open the book either. (powerful, forceful, boisterious, mighty)</p>
<h3>John's reaction to this fact</h3>
<blockquote>v. 4 "And I wept much"</blockquote>
<p>Because of three things -</p>
<h4>None found "worthy" to "open the book"</h4>
<h4>None found worthy to "read the book"</h4>
<h4>None found worthy to "look thereon"</h4>
<h2>The Time of the Opening of the Book</h2>
<p>After the Rapture, 4:1</p>
<h2>The Purpose of the Opening of the Book</h2>
<p>To release the judgments of God on the earth</p>
