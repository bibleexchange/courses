<h1>Fall of Babylon the Great (Ch. 18)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mystery Babylon is a place as well as a system. The System has two parts: Religious (Ch. 17) and Commercial (Ch. 18). The fall of Babylon is mentioned twice (17:16 and 18:21) because there are two stages to her judgment. First, the religious part of the system will be judged and then the commercial part of the system.</p>
<p>In the judgment upon the religious part of the system (Ch. 17), she is put down and taken over by the Antichrist. This will unite religion and commerce, making the State (Antichrist) supreme. Babylon the Great, in final revelation, is a city ruled over by the Antichrist as both the religious and political head. She becomes abundantly rich in carnal wealth for her aid to the devil.</p></p>
<p>Both the place and the system of &quot;Babylon the Great&quot; will suffer greatly for her role in the Antichrist's efforts. </p>
<p>It is important to note, that presently, there is no city &quot;Babylon&quot;. If the place &quot;Babylon&quot; (50 miles south of modern Iraq) is to be included in this judgment, Babylon as a city must first be rebuilt.</p>
<p>The important detail concerning Babylon is not where on a map can we place her, but what is she guilty of that incurs such severe action from God. Babylon in Chapters 17 and 18, is at the very least symbolic of both a religious system (ch. 17) and a commercial system (ch. 18) that become God's enemies.</p>
<h2>The Announcement of her Judgment (vs. 1-8)</h2>
<h3>The Announcing Angel, vs. 1-3</h3>
<p>A glorious messenger appears from out of heaven.</p>
<h4>He Comes with Great Authority</h4>
<p>All power and authority truly belongs to God! (Daniel 7:14; John 5:26-27; 1 Corinthians 15:24)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John 5:25&mdash;Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>The Earth is Lighted with His Glory</h4>
<p>This is never said describing created beings, but is often said of God! (Psalm 72:18,19; Isaiah 6:1-3; Ezekiel 43:2; Revelation 1:13-16; 21:23)</p>
<h4>He Cries Mightily with a Strong Voice</h4>
<h3>The Calling Out of God's People, vs. 4-8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 18:4&mdash;And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the mighty word goes into effect, a voice from heaven (probably, the Father) says come out of her, my people. His people are warned to avoid getting caught up in the marketing of the evil system. (An effective advertisement is one that convinces you that you need something.) </p>
<ul>
<li>Come Out of her</li>
<li>Call on Jesus </li>
<li>Repent of Sin</li>
<li>Be Born of the Spirit (Not a soul-ish or intellectual thing, but a spiritual experience.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Satans really merchandise is the souls of men. He takes advantage of and seeks to rob a man of his soul. What do we want? Faith or Feeling. Bible or Psychology. (1 Corinthians 13:45) The devil employs all manner of means in this market: business, religion, drugs, sex, gossip, lustful and rebellious music, </p>
<h2>The Reaction to Her Judgment (vs. 9-20)</h2>
<p>The fall of Babylon is one of the most marvelous events of all time (i.e., the flood, Sodom and Gomorrah). Consider how this would effect the whole world and even how it would effect you. Her fall is a great disappointment to many as just at her height of success she is destroyed. All the schemes of human progress are left disappointed and many will lament. , but there are mixed reactions to her judgment for two worlds are involved. There some who will rejoice while others are crying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revelation 18:9,20&mdash;And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, 20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Lamentation</h3>
<h4>Lamenting of Royalty, vs. 9-10</h4>
<h4>Lamenting of Merchants, vs. 11-16</h4>
<h4>Lamenting of Shipmasters, vs. 17-19</h4>
<p>But while these lament, a grand jubilee fills the sky!</p>
<h3>Rejoicing</h3>
<h4>The Heavenly Beings Rejoice</h4>
<h4>The Apostles Rejoice</h4>
<h4>The Prophets Rejoice</h4>
<h2>After her Fall (vs. 21-24)</h2>
<p>Re 18:21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
 22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
 23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</p>
