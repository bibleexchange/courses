<h1>The Man Child,12:2-5</h1>
<img src="/assets/crown.png" id="crown">
<p>&ldquo;The Man Child (12:2-5)&rdquo; is a continuation of the &ldquo;great wonder&rdquo; John saw in 12:1. Remember, as it is a &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; (sign, token, symbol) it demands our contemplation and careful consideration. The language used is intended to be interpreted figuratively. Also, in our previous study, we stated that the woman in verse one is the Church. Let us focus now not on the woman so much but the fact that she is with child and she gives birth to a &ldquo;man child&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If there is a message that the devil hates, it is the message of the Man Child. This message threatens all the devil has accomplished and would like to do regarding humanity. The devil is persistent in his efforts to snatch away any seed of the message of the Man Child.</p>

<blockquote>Matthew 13:19 &ndash; When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth not, cometh the wicked one, and catch it the way that which was sown in his heart.</blockquote>

<h2>The Identity of the Man Child</h2>
<p>If the woman is the church, who is the Man Child? </p>
<h3>Some believe the Man Child to be Christ. (i.e., <a href=&rdquo;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Scofield&rdquo;>Scofield</a>)</h3>
<p>Consider some objections to this theory:</p>
<h4>This Wonder is Prophetic</h4>
<p>This chapter is part of the vision that was given to John the beloved 60 years after the ascension of Christ. The entire vision is a revelation of things that were &ldquo;to come to pass&rdquo; AFTER it was given (Revelation 1:1; 4:1). How then can the translation of this man child refer to the ascension of Christ, which occurred six decades before this vision?</p>
<h4>This Wonder is Unlike the Nativity</h4>
<p>Christ came down from heaven at birth. The Man Child is caught up to heaven.</p>
<h4>This Wonder is Unlike the Crucifixion and Ascension of Christ</h4>
<p>If this Scripture refers the ascension of Christ, why should the figure of a child, which the devil cannot kill (the Man Child is not harmed by the devil), &ldquo;caught up unto God, and to his throne&rdquo; be used to symbolize the ascension into Heaven of a full-grown man, whom the devil did kill? (Christ surrendered His life and He died.)</p>
<h3>The Man Child is a product of the Church.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The woman is in travail to bring forth&rdquo;) the woman which is the church is producing sons. </p>
<h3>The Man Child is a fully mature son.</h3>

<blockquote>Ephesians 4:13&mdash;Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hebrews 5:14&mdash;But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</blockquote>
<p>The Man Child is the Overcomer in Revelation 3:21 and the Bride of Christ in Revelation 19:7.</p>

<h2>The Revealing of the Man Child</h2>

<h3>The Seed</h3>

<p>&rdquo;And she brought forth&rdquo; &ndash; tikto &ndash; to produce from seed. This &ldquo;seed&rdquo; is the Word of God presented much through the efforts of God's ministers which are God's gifts given to the saints (Ephesians 4:11-13).</p>
<p>The seed is the revealed Word or the Word of God that has been made alive by the Spirit of God.</p>

<h3>The Birth</h3>

<p>To bring forth the child is to reveal (bring to light or manifest) the child.</p>

<blockquote>Romans 8:17-19&mdash;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1 Peter 1:3-5&mdash;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</blockquote>

<h3>The Pain</h3>
<p>Revealed with great pain. Vs. 2 &ldquo;cried&rdquo; travailing in birth. Pain to be delivered.</p>

<blockquote>Romans 8:23&mdash;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</blockquote>

<h4>The Man Child will be brought forth through intercessory prayer.</h4>  
<p>quot;Cried&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;krazo&rdquo; &ndash; meaning to call aloud, to cry out, or any inarticulate cries. (Romans 8:26-27) This is not a pious recital of prayers, but is a travailing in prayer is a mother travails in giving birth. The prayer must be earnest and must be in faith. &ldquo;Waiting&rdquo; in Romans 8:23 is&rdquo;Apekdechomai&rdquo; meaning to fully or eagerly expect.</p>

<h4>Revealed under great persecution. Vs. 4</h4>

<p>There will be pain &ldquo;basanizo&rdquo; meaning to put to the test. There will be trials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&rdquo; The devil will fight harder against this truth than any other truth that has been revealed because the Man Child takes his place in heaven. Vs.8.</p>

<h3>The Time</h3>
<p>The Man Child is revealed in the last time. The 11th chapter ends with Christ ruling the kingdoms of this world which are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign for ever and ever. Chapter 12 brings us back to the third chapter and at the end of the church age. Luke 21:28; one Peter 1:3&ndash; The time of the revealing is just before the tribulation. The church is still on the earth and will face 3 -1/2 years of tribulation&mdash;vs. 6 &ldquo;in the wilderness&rdquo;. Also, the Man Child is revealed before the Church is perfected. Verse 14</p>
<h2>The Nature of the Man Child.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A Man Child&rdquo;&rdquo;Arrhen&rdquo; or &rdquo; Arsen&rdquo; - means male. It has to do with manhood and not gender.</p>
<h3>Manly characteristics -heroic virtues.</h3>
<p>They are strong -not weak.They are true -not false.Not full of hypocrisy.</p>
<h3>Overcomers, vs. 5</h3>
<p>.&rdquo;Who was to rule&rdquo; Rev. 12:11; 2:26,27; 3:21.The &ldquo;Overcomer&rdquo; is promised to sit with Him on His throne. These are &ldquo;caught up to God and to His throne.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Humble, vs.11.</h3>
<p>Did not combat the devil in their own strength. II Cor. 10:4.</p>
<h2>The Characteristics of the Man Child.</h2>
<h3>A student of the Word.</h3>
<p>To confess the Word, you must know the Word, vs. 11.&rdquo;by the Word of their testimony&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A believer in the Word.</h3>
<p>To confess the Word, you must believe the Word They believed in the blood of the Lamb because of the Word.Vs. 11 &ldquo;overcame him by the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A lover of the Word.Vs 11</h3>
<p>&ldquo;And loved not their lives&rdquo; They loved the Word more than their lives.</p>
<h2>The Development of the Man Child.</h2>
<p>There is a development here. The Scripture indicates a process&mdash;salvation, Holy Ghost Baptism and fully mature son. </p>
<h3>Conceived.&rdquo;Gaster&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Vs. 2 &ldquo;With child&rdquo; (Born-Again Believers)</p>
<p>Conceived by the Word. The Word of God (like seed) is being planted in the Church by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<h3>Child.&rdquo;Teknon&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Vs. 4 &ldquo;Developing&rdquo;(Holy Ghost Baptized Believers)</p>
<h3>Son.&rdquo;Huios&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Vs. 5 &ldquo;Matured&rdquo; (the Bride of Christ, Overcomers)</p>
<p>In type in Gen. 2:21, Adam and Eve. Gen. 5:24 Enoch - Methuselah - Noah.The Word of truth (like seed) is being planted in the heart of the Church by His Spirit. The Body of Christ is not yet fully-grown or mature but God is nourishing it.He will bring it forth. </p>
<p>There are a lot of babes in the church. There are a lot of children in the church. There must be a maturing of sons &ndash; fully grown. 
A perfect man. Matthew 5:48; Ephesians 4:12-13.
&rdquo;Huious&rdquo; is a fully matured son (Hebrews 5:14) that is in a position to receive full inheritance (Galatians 4:1-2; I Peter 1:4) and full power (Ephesians 1:13-14).</p>
<h3>The Position of the Man Child</h3>
<p>As a child, the Believer does not differ from a servant (Galaitans 4:1). </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nepos&rdquo; infant, non-speaking, immature, childish. As the Believer develops and matures in Christ there awaits for him an &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; or &ldquo;positioning as son&rdquo;. This adoption is what we are &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; (Romans 8:23) for: &ldquo;the adoption&rdquo; &ndash;the placing or positioning of sons (&ldquo;huiothesia&rdquo;). </p>
<p>God does not adopt sinners into the family of God. The sinner must be born again into the family of God (John 3:7). The sinner is begotten by the Word and the the Spirit (John 3:5). Adoption is a term involving the positioning of Believers as sons. It is not a putting into the family by spiritual birth, but a putting into position of sons. Notice the Adoption the Apostle is speaking of (Romans 8:23) is yet future at his time. This positioning is a reward for MATURITY and OVERCOMING.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 12:5 &hellip; who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron:&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>Because of the prophecies about Christ in Psalm 2:9 and Revelation 2:26-27 many believe that Revelation 12:5 is talking only about Christ.</p>
<blockquote>Psalm 2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: 27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>

<p>But, Christ promised a position on His Throne with those that will overcome even as He overcame. The manchilde goes to the Throne of God.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</blockquote>
<p>Revelation 12:5 &hellip;caught up unto God, and to his throne.</p>
