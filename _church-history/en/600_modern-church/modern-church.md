He sent a letter of resignation when they arrived in India. The partner took the letter back, and went to try to raise money from the Baptists.

The government of India would not let them stay, and William Carey suggested that they should go to Burma. When they arrived in Burma, they started learning the language, opened a school for girls, and translated the New Testament. It was six years before they had their first convert.
