# One: The Apostolic Church (AD 30–100)

From the Day of Pentecost to the completion of the New Testament

## Details of the early church

### The church's enduement

They received power, after the Holy Ghost came upon them (Acts 1:8).

### The church's original location

The church began in the city of Jerusalem, but persecution would soon scatter them abroad (Acts 8:1).

### The church's membership

The original members were all Jews. They didn't yet understand that the Gospel was also for the gentiles.

### The church's government

The twelve Apostles as a body governed the Church.

### The church's doctrines

#### Jesus was the Messiah (Acts 2:36)

#### The resurrection of Christ (Acts 2:30–32)

#### The return of Christ (I Thess. 4:15–17)

## The leaders of the Church

### Peter

The apostle Peter was the spokesman among the Apostles. He assisted James at the Jerusalem Church. History records Peter was martyred in Rome about AD 67.

### Stephen

He was one of the seven chosen to care for the needs of the church (Acts 6:8). He is described as a man full of faith and the Holy Ghost. He was used by God to do great wonders and miracles among the people. Stephen was the first Christian Martyr (Acts 7:55–60).

### Philip

He established a church in Samaria. This church was recognized by the Apostles. This was the first church outside of Judaism. He also founded churches in Gaza, Joppa, and Caesarea (Acts 8:40).

### Paul

#### Saul's persecution

Before he was called Paul, his name was Saul. Saul was a leader in persecuting the Christians (Acts 8:3). He was the one that consented to Stephen's death. The persecution helped to expand the church (Acts 8:4).

#### Saul's conversion

Jesus confronted Saul on the road to Damascus. He became a powerful preacher to both Jews and Gentiles (Acts 9:19–22). Saul's name was changed to Paul. Paul became the mighty apostle to the Gentiles.

#### Paul's missionary journeys

Paul took several missionary journeys to spread the Gospel. Paul established churches at Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, and Corinth. The churches were established though much suffering (II Cor. 11:23–28).

He taught in the synagogues and received from the Holy Ghost much of the New Testament. While a prisoner at Rome he wrote Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. History records Paul was martyred around AD 67.

### James

James was the younger brother of the Lord. He is not to be confused with the apostle James who was killed by Herod in Acts 12. "And he killed James the brother of John with the sword" (Acts 12:2). James was the presiding elder or pastor of the Jerusalem church. He recognized the Gentiles as part of the body of Christ. History records James was martyred around AD 62.

### John

John was the youngest of the Apostles. He arose as a leader after the death of the other original Apostles. John taught Ignatius and Polycarp who would become leaders of the Church.

## The Church among the Gentiles

### Peter and Cornelius (Acts 10)

Peter preached the Gospel in Cornelius' house. The Gentiles received the Holy Ghost while Peter was preaching (Acts 10:44–48).

### Peter's report to the elders (Acts 11:1–18)

### The Council at Jerusalem AD 48 (Acts 15:5–20)

The Apostles called a council of elders together to settle the question of whether the Gentiles should keep the ceremonial Law of Moses. Some of the people were insisting that the Gentiles be circumcised (vs. 5). The council decided that Gentiles do not need to follow the Jewish ceremonial law.

### Paul rebukes Peter (Gal. 2:11–14)

## The fall of Jerusalem in AD 70

### The Jews broke out in rebellion against Roman rule in AD 66

### The Roman general Titus destroyed the city of Jerusalem

The city caught on fire, which caused the gold to melt between the bricks. Soldiers took apart the temple brick by brick to retrieve the gold. This event fulfilled the prophecy of Jesus concerning the temple.
