# Christmas 2016


## Some Words

### Merry

Merry:  be happy, joyful and light-hearted.

### Christmas

The Word "Christ" is borrowed from the Latin Christus and from the Greek Christos also meaning the anointed one. The Greek is a translation of Hebrew mashiach meaning anointed of the Lord or Messiah. In the word Christmas, the suffix -mas evolves from the Old English word maesse meaning festival, feast day or mass.

X-Mas has been used since the 1500's. IN Greek, X or "Chi" is the first letter of Christ's name.

### "Merry Christmas"

"Merry Christmas" was more frequently used in America and Britians preferring the more sober sounding 'Happy Christmas'.

According to a Rasmussen poll, 68% of Americans, c. 2012, prefer "Merry Christmas" to "Happy Holidays". 

### Noel

late 14c., nowel "feast of Christmas," from Old French noel "the Christmas season," 

### Carol

c. 1300, "joyful song," also "dance in a ring," 

The meaning "Christmas hymn of joy" is attested from c. 1500.

## Nicholas

St. Nicholas was a Bishop who lived in the fourth century in a place called Myra in Asia Minor (now called Turkey). He was a very rich man because his parents died when he was young and left him a lot of money. He was also a very kind man and had a reputation for helping the poor and giving secret gifts to people who needed it. There are several legends about St. Nicholas, although we don't know if any of them are true!

The most famous story about St. Nicholas tells how the custom of hanging up stockings to get presents in first started! It goes like this:

There was a poor man who had three daughters. He was so poor, he did not have enough money for a dowry, so his daughters couldn't get married. (A dowry is a sum of money paid to the bridegroom by the brides parents on the wedding day. This still happens in some countries, even today.) One night, Nicholas secretly dropped a bag of gold down the chimney and into the house (This meant that the oldest daughter was then able to be married.). The bag fell into a stocking that had been hung by the fire to dry! This was repeated later with the second daughter. Finally, determined to discover the person who had given him the money, the father secretly hid by the fire every evening until he caught Nicholas dropping in a bag of gold. Nicholas begged the man to not tell anyone what he had done, because he did not want to bring attention to himself. But soon the news got out and when anyone received a secret gift, it was thought that maybe it was from Nicholas.

## Some Songs

- Away in a Manger

"Away in a Manger" is a Christmas carol first published in the late nineteenth century and used widely throughout the English-speaking world. In Britain, it is one of the most popular carols; a 1996 Gallup Poll ranked it joint second.[1] Although it was long claimed to be the work of German religious reformer Martin Luther, the carol is now thought to be wholly American in origin. "LUTHER's CRADLE SONG"

- Joy to the World
- Silent Night
- It Came Upon a Midnight Clear

## The Star

Between 1935 and 1959, Hayden's very first Zeiss projector (three others have been installed since) was run back some 2,000 years in an attempt to reproduce the positions of the planets around the time of the birth of Christ. The entire procedure would take four hours with the planets engaged in an incredible fast-moving dance while the moon flipped around the sky a hundred times a minute! 

Ultimately, the projector was brought to a halt   around the time of Christ's birth with the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars forming a triangle low in the western sky. 

## December 25?

Another scientific astronomy experiment pinpoints June 17 as Christ's Birth date.

Researchers tracked the appearance of the 'Christmas star', which the Bible states wise men followed to find Jesus. Australian stargazer Dave Reneke used complex computer software to chart the exact positions of all celestial bodies and map the night sky as it would have appeared over the Holy Land more than 2,000 years ago. He discovered that a bright star really did appear over Bethlehem 2,000 years ago - but pinpointed the date of Christ's birth as June 17, and not December 25.
Scientists claim the Christmas star was most likely a magnificent conjunction of the planets Venus and Jupiter, which were so close together they would have shone unusually brightly as a single 'beacon of light' which appeared suddenly.

## Jesus

Jesus is the English transliteration of the Greek name Iesus. Joshua is the English transliteration of the Hebrew name Yeshuah. Both Jesus and Joshua mean Yahweh saves or Jehovah is salvation. The name Jesus appears in the Bible more than 900 times. 

- The bread of life and the living bread (6:35, 48, 51). 
- The light of the world (John 8:12). 
- The good shepherd (John 10:11, 14).
- The Son of God (John 10:36). 
- The way, the truth and the life (John 14:6).
