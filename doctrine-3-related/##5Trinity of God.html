<h1>THE TRINITY OF GOD</h1>
<h2>The doctrine defined</h2>
<h3>Trinity is from the Latin trinus and means threefold</h3>
<h3>In reference to God it describes The Three in One</h3>
<h3>The phrase Triune God is also used to describe the Trinity</h3>
<h4>Refers to the Tri – unity of God</h4>
<h4>Three Persons within One God</h4>
<h4>The Scriptural word Godhead is also used to refer to The Three Persons within One God</h4>
<blockquote>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:(Rom 1:20)</blockquote>
<h3>Within the One God are Three distinct Persons: The Father, The Son, and The Holy Ghost.</h3>
<h4>They are co–eternal</h4>
<h4>They are equal in power</h4>
<h4>They are one in unity</h4>
<h4>They are three in persons</h4>
<h4>They are each God</h4>
<h5>In essence</h5>
<h5>In attributes</h5>
<h3>This is a scripturally revealed doctrine</h3>
<blockquote>I John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one</blockquote>
<h2>Erroneous views  (THESE ARE FALSE VIEWS!)
<h3>Sabellianism</h3>
<h4>Bishop Sabellius taught that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are simply three aspects or manifestations of God.</h4>
<h4>There are three manifestations of one God.</h4>
<h5>Sometimes this is referred to as three personalities.</h5>
<h5>God does not have split personalities.</h5>
<h4>Oneness teaching falls under this category.</h4>
<h4>Refutation to this view</h4>
<h5>Scripture clearly teaches the plurality of the Godhea</h5>
<p>Elohim is a plural noun.</p>
<blockquote>“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. (Gen 1:)</blockquote>
<p>Plural pronouns used to refer to God.
<blockquote>“And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness…” (Gen. 1:18)</blockquote>
<p>The Bible reveals there are three persons within One God.
<blockquote>“For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. (1Jo 5:7)
<h5>There are sharp distinctions revealed in Scripture between The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
<p>The Father sent The Son – 
<blockquote>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting lif<h4> (Joh 3:16)
<blockquote>“I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.”  (Joh 16:28)
<p>The Son returns to The Father –
<blockquote>“Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your Go<h4> (Joh 20:17)
<blockquote>“A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. (Joh 16:16)
<p>The Father and Son send The Spirit –
<blockquote>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:(Joh 15:26)
<blockquote>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. (Joh 16:7)
<p>The Spirit intercedes with The Father.
<blockquote>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttere<h4> (Rom 8:26)
<h5>The Bible defines the oneness of God.
<blockquote>And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: (Joh 17:26).
<p>The body is one in unity, yet many in person.
<blockquote>Wherefore they are no more twain, but one fles<h4> What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”  (Mat 19:6)
<p>Husband and wife become one, yet there are still two persons.
<h3></h3>Arianism
<h4>Arius
<h5>Presbyter of Alexandria about 318 AD
<h5>Taught the Son is subordinate to the Father
<h4>Christ is not eternal in existence.
<h5>Jesus had a beginning 
<h5>Jesus is a lesser God (REMEMBER THIS IS THE FALSE VIEW!)
<h4>Refutation to this view.
<h5>The Son is God
<blockquote>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was Go<h4>  (Joh 1:<h5>
<h5>Jesus is equal with God
<blockquote>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: (Phi 2:5-6)
<blockquote>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. (Col 2:9)
<h5>Christ is eternal.
<blockquote>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. (Rev 1:8)
<blockquote>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlastin<h4> (Mic 5:<h5>
<p>This is a Messianic prophecy.
<h3></h3>Tritheism
<h4>The belief in three Gods.
<h4>Refutation to this view.
<h5>Scripture declares there is One Go<h4>
<blockquote>Deut. 6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:
<p>Singular                 Plural                       Singular
<p>Jehovah our Elohim is one Jehovah
<p>These three are one– I John 5:7
<h5>One God revealed in three Persons
<p>Not three Gods
<p>More than one God would be contrary to Scripture
<blockquote>Thou shalt have no other gods before m<h4>  (Exo 20:<h5>
<h5>Polytheism is an erroneous view of Go<h4>
