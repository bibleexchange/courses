<h3><span lang="en">Teaching and preaching the Word of God.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matthew 4:23 &mdash; And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<h3><span lang="en">Bringing deliverance to the captives.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Luke 4:18 &mdash; The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Matthew 8:16 &mdash; When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<h2><span lang="en">The redemptive work of Christ</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h2>
<p><span lang="en">The most important work of Christ was to purchase redemption for man through His death upon the cross. The Word became flesh for the purpose of dying for lost humanity. </span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en">The death of Christ</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<h4><span lang="en">Satisfied the penalty of sin according to the Law of God.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h4>

<blockquote><span lang="en">Romans 6:23 &mdash; For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">1 Corinthians 15:3 &mdash; For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<h4><span lang="en">Appeased the judgment of God through the sacrifice of the Divine blood of the Lamb of God.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h4>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Romans 3:25 &mdash; Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Greek word here rendered propitiation refers to the Mercy seat. The Mercy seat is the place where the High priest sprinkled the blood of a lamb on the Day of Atonement to satisfy the wrath of God against the sins of the people. Jesus became our Mercy seat when He offered Himself as the pure spotless Lamb of God and shedding His blood as the supreme sacrifice for the sin of humanity.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<h4><span lang="en">Defeated the power of death.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h4>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matthew 12:40 &mdash; For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Hebrews 2:14 &mdash; For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Jesus went into the region of the dead to defeat death. Death could not hold the Son of God. Jesus defeated the devil that had the power of death. Jesus stripped the devil of his power and authority and took the keys of death away from the devil. </span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Revelation 1:18 &mdash; I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<h3><span lang="en">The resurrection of Christ</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<p><span lang="en">The resurrection of Christ is the event that separates Jesus from other religious leaders and false messiahs. Buddah, Mohamed, Sun Myung Moon and other false messiahs are in the grave. There is an empty tomb in Jerusalem where Jesus lay for three days, but when the three days were fulfilled Christ arose victorious over death, hell and the grave. </span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<h2><span lang="en">The continued intercession of Christ</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h2>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Romans 8:34 &mdash; Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Jesus ascended back to heaven and is at the right hand of the Father who ever lives to make intercession for us. The Scripture tells us that Jesus our Great High Priest is still interceding for us in heaven.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Old Testament high priest interceded for the people on the Day of Atonement sprinkling the blood of a lamb on the Mercy Seat for the sins of the people. Jesus offered Himself once shedding His Divine blood for the sins of humanity. The blood of Jesus still has the power to make the vilest sinner clean. The Father views the justified saint through the redemptive work of Christ. Jesus is still our Great High Priest.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Hebrews 7:25 &mdash; Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
