<h3><span lang="en">Jesus is not a created being.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<h3><span lang="en">Jesus is the Alpha and Omega.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Revelation 1:7-8 -- Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. </span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">This Scripture tells us that Jesus is the Alpha and Omega.  Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet and Omega is the last signifying that Jesus is the first and the last. Jesus is the one who was pierced and is coming with the clouds. Jesus is the Lord which is, and which was, and which is to come. The context of the Scripture clearly reveals that Jesus is the one speaking and declaring that He is the Alpha and Omega. </span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en">Jesus is everlasting.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Micah 5:2 --  But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>

<h3><span lang="en">Jesus came in the flesh.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  -- John 1:14</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">According to the law of the kinsman redeemer only the next of kin could pay the price of redemption. Jesus the everlasting Word became a man to fulfill the part of the kinsman redeemer and pay the price for fallen humanity with His Divine blood upon the cross. </span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Ephesians 1:7 -- In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<h3><span lang="en">Jesus was born as a babe of the virgin Mary.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matthew 1:18: - Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Mary was the chosen vessel to birth the Christ, but that which was conceived within her was not of man, but of the Holy Ghost. The blood of Jesus is Divine and not tainted by the sin of fallen humanity.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<h3><span lang="en">Jesus was all man and all God at the same time.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></h3>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Colossians 2:9 -- For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The wood overlaid with gold in the furniture of the Tabernacle typifies this dual nature of Christ. Wood is a type of humanity while Gold typifies the Divine nature of God.  As a man Jesus limited Himself to a human body to be in one location at one time, yet within Him was the fullness of God. The humanity of Christ became tired and hungry and needed to rest as do all men. Jesus was our supreme example of prayer and desired fellowship with the Father. He would often arise early to pray and commune with the Father.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Hebrews 4:15 -- For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</span><span lang="swa">SWAHILI</span></blockquote>
