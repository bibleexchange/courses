##0001###Introduction to Theology
##0002###The Definition of Theology
##0003###Three popular Views of the Term
##0004###Christian (Bible Theology):
##0005###The science of God (His existence&#44; nature&#44; attributes&#44; laws&#44; government&#44; works&#44; whatever may be known of Him)&#44; of the relations that exist between God and the universe&#44; and of our relations&#44; duties&#44; responsibilities to Him and the universe. It is the science of things divine. This view&#44; in its broadest sense&#44; includes all knowledge/truth.
##0006###Scientific:
##0007###The critical&#44; historical&#44; philosophical and psychological study of religion and religious ideas. 
##0008###Common:
##0009###The study of man&apos;s universal concepts of a Higher Power or Person. 
##0010###Etymology of the Term
##0011###Two Greek words supply the basic meaning. a. Theos: God b. Logos: word&#44; speech&#44; reason. The etymology suggests a reasoned treatise or discourse about God.
##0012###Use of the Term
##0013###Broad&#44; general&#44; inclusive:
##0014###The sum of all Christian doctrines&#44; or religious truth; rational inquiry into religious questions.
##0015###Narrow&#44; particular&#44; exclusive:
##0016###The doctrine of God&#44; His Being and His works.
##0017###Synonymous treatment of doctrine and theology
##0018###Both are sciences that treat of religious beliefs&#44; creeds and principles.
##0019###Both are divine revelations of truth. Doctrine is the specific revelation of truth. Dogma is the human statement of the truth incorporated in a creed.
##0020###The Ground of Theology
##0021###The unmistakable evidences of the existence of a God who is related to our universe.
##0022###The capacity of the human mind to know God and certain of those relations.
##0023###The provision of a revelation that brings God and the human being into contact and communion.
##0024###The absolute dependence of the human being on a Higher Power to live at peace with himself and his fellow creatures.
##0025###The ever recurrent questions concerning human origin&#44; human destiny and the riddle of life demand intelligible answers.
##0026###The Sources of Theology
##0027###There are two authentic sources.
##0028###Nature (Natural Theology)
##0029###The universe and the world in which we live. (Psalm 19:1-4)
##0030###The intuitive response to nature&apos;s light. (Romans 1:8-20; 2:14&#44;15)
##0031###Natural knowledge is elemental and limited(Acts 17:23)
##0032###The Holy Scriptures (Revealed Theology)
##0033###They are absolute&#44; final and complete.
##0034###They give saving knowledge.
##0035###There are three undependable sources.
##0036###Traditionalism
##0037###This theory asserts the claim that the ecclesiastical interpretations of the Scriptures are equal to&#44; and often superior to&#44; the Holy Scriptures themselves. This is a Roman fallacy. 
##0038###Rationalism
##0039###This theory places reason above revelation. The rationalists reject all Scriptures that do not pass the test of human understanding and reason. The miracles of the Bible are subjected to these tests. The rationalists give three interpretations to the miracles: Natural&#44; Mystical&#44; and Mythical. 
##0040###Mysticism
##0041###This theory supports the practice of getting new light about God through personal revelation. Subjective experience is claimed to be equal to written revelation. Personal notions and prejudices may lead to error. 
##0042###The Relationships of Theology
##0043###Theology is a science.
##0044###It treats of certified facts and data that are logically arranged and classified.
##0045###Religion is a life/lifestyle.
##0046###The Latin meaning is to bind or tie fast&#44; to restrain. Religion is a life in communion with and controlled by God.
##0047###Morality is a law.
##0048###i.e.&#44; a code of behavior by which people govern themselves; a system of ideas of right and wrong conduct. 
##0049###Worship is an art.
##0050###It is the outward expression of religion. 
##0051###Salvation is an experience.
##0052###It involves a personal awareness of God and divine forgiveness. 
##0053###A theologian may be only a scientist.
##0054###A Christian student of theology fits all the relationships.
##0055###The Classifications of Theology

This as an old English word that can also be rendered non-moral and refers to attributes of the Divine essence that do not involve moral qualities. An example would be the Omnipotence of God&#44; which is an attribute of the very nature of God and cannot be changed.
##0102###It protects the mind against error.
##0103###Truth garrisons the heart and mind. 
##0104###It is a necessary qualification for the ministry.
