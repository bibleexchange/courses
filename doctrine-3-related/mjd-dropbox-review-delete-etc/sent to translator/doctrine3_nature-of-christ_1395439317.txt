##0001###The Nature of Christ
##0002###Christology is the study of Jesus Christ. Christ is the Greek form of the Hebrew word messiah and means anointed one. Jesus is the long awaited for messiah who came according to prophecy.
##0003###The Divinity of Christ.
##0004###Jesus is God.
##0005###John 1:1 -- In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
##0006###Isaiah:9:6 -- For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
##0007###This is a prophecy of Christ who is called the mighty God. There is only one mighty God; Jesus is THE MIGHTY GOD.
##0008###Jesus is not a lesser God than the Father.
##0009###Philippians 2:5-6 -- Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<br />Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 
##0010###Jesus is God and is equal with God the Father. This subject will be covered in greater detail in the section: The Trinity of God.
##0011###The devil has attacked the truth of the Deity of Christ.
##0012###Deity -- God; the Supreme Being. or infinite self-existing Spirit. - Webster
##0013###A common denominator of the cults is to deny the Deity of Christ.
##0014###Mormons teach Jesus is not God.
##0015###Jehovah's Witnesses teach Jesus is a lesser god than the Father.
##0016###Muslims deny that Jesus is the Son of God.
##0017###Other cults teach Jesus was just a prophet or great teacher.
##0018###The devil knows if he can get man to doubt the Deity of Christ then the foundation of their faith is destroyed. If Jesus is not God then He is a liar and the Bible is not true.
##0019###The eternal existence of Christ.
##0020###Jesus is not a created being.
##0021###Jesus is the Alpha and Omega.
##0022###Revelation 1:7-8 -- Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. 
##0023###This Scripture tells us that Jesus is the Alpha and Omega.  Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet and Omega is the last signifying that Jesus is the first and the last. Jesus is the one who was pierced and is coming with the clouds. Jesus is the Lord which is, and which was, and which is to come. The context of the Scripture clearly reveals that Jesus is the one speaking and declaring that He is the Alpha and Omega. 
##0024###Jesus is everlasting.
##0025###Micah 5:2 --  But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.
##0026###The Humanity of Christ.
##0027###Jesus came in the flesh.
##0028###And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  -- John 1:14
##0029###According to the law of the kinsman redeemer only the next of kin could pay the price of redemption. Jesus the everlasting Word became a man to fulfill the part of the kinsman redeemer and pay the price for fallen humanity with His Divine blood upon the cross. 
##0030###Ephesians 1:7 -- In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
##0031###Jesus was born as a babe of the virgin Mary.
##0032###Matthew 1:18: - Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
##0033###Mary was the chosen vessel to birth the Christ, but that which was conceived within her was not of man, but of the Holy Ghost. The blood of Jesus is Divine and not tainted by the sin of fallen humanity.
##0034###Jesus was all man and all God at the same time.
##0035###Colossians 2:9 -- For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
##0036###The wood overlaid with gold in the furniture of the Tabernacle typifies this dual nature of Christ. Wood is a type of humanity while Gold typifies the Divine nature of God.  As a man Jesus limited Himself to a human body to be in one location at one time, yet within Him was the fullness of God. The humanity of Christ became tired and hungry and needed to rest as do all men. Jesus was our supreme example of prayer and desired fellowship with the Father. He would often arise early to pray and commune with the Father.
##0037###Hebrews 4:15 -- For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
