> Isaiah 63:15&mdash;

The presence of God is powerful, but as powerful as His presence is, it can become a secret.

We neglect the presence of God. Sometimes because we feel unworthy to worship.

We are not judged by how many sins we have committed but how much light we have neglected.

The light comes to show us a better way.
