> Isaiah 63:15&mdash;Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained? 

The presence of God is powerful, but as powerful as His presence is, it can become a secret.

We neglect the presence of God. Sometimes because we feel unworthy to worship.

We are not judged by how many sins we have committed but how much light we have neglected.

The light comes to show us a better way.

From the words of Isaiah there appears to be a distance between the prophet and God.

> Luke 1:19&mdash;And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
