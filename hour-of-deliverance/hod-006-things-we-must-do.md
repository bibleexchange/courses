##Things We Must Do

TEXT: Acts 9:6

>Acts 9:6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.

###Introduction
There are some Things that we cannot do. We cannot earn our salvation. There are also things that we MUST do.

###We Must Believe God

>Hebrews 11:6&mdash;But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

God is trustworthy and we can trust Him.

>Hebrews 11:1&mdash;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 

The Lord is the "Panacea" and faith is an action that receives from Him.

###We Must be Born Again

>John 3:7&mdash;Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. 

###We Must Believe in Jesus as Our Only Savior

>Acts 4:12&mdash;Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

Not through denomination, organization or fellowship, but it is only through

###We Must Worship God in Spirit and in Truth

>John 4:23&mdash;But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

###We Must Pray

>Luke 18:1&mdash;And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

We will not last long unless we pray. We must gather together and pray so that will not grow cold.

###We Must Pray in the Holy Ghost

>Romans 8:26&mdash;Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

###We Must Witness for the Lord Jesus Christ

>Acts 23:11 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
