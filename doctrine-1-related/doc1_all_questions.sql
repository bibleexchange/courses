<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Justification is by faith. Since the law cannot justify&#44; man�s only hope is for a &ldquo;righteousness without the law&rdquo; (Rom. 3:21). This is not an unlawful unrighteousness&#44; or a religion that permits us to sin&#44; but is justification that changes our position with God based on the merits of Christ. This is the &ldquo;righteousness of God&rdquo; (a righteousness which God imparts)&#44; and it is a gift because man lacks the power to develop it or work it out. (Eph. 2:8-10) The three operations of faith are as follows:,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Kuhesabuliwa kuwahaki ni kwa imani. Kwa sababu sheria haiwezi kuhesabu kuwa haki, taraja tu ya mtu ni &ldquo;Haki bila shema&rdquo; (warumi 3:21). Hiyo siyo kutokuwa haki bila kutokea kwa sheria, ao dini ambayo imetujuzu to tenda dhambi, lakini ni kuhesabuliwa kwoa haki ambao kumebadili uamuzi wetu na Mungu yenye kuketi juu ya staha ya kristo. Hiyo ndiyo &ldquo;Haki ya Mungu&rdquo; (Haki ambao Mungu ametolea), na imekuwa kipawa kwa sababu mtu amekosa mamlaka ya kuikomalisha ao kuitimiza. (waefeso 2:8-10).
