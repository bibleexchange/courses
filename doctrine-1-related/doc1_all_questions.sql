<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Justification is by faith. Since the law cannot justify&#44; manï¿½s only hope is for a &ldquo;righteousness without the law&rdquo; (Rom. 3:21). This is not an unlawful unrighteousness&#44; or a religion that permits us to sin&#44; but is justification that changes our position with God based on the merits of Christ. This is the &ldquo;righteousness of God&rdquo; (a righteousness which God imparts)&#44; and it is a gift because man lacks the power to develop it or work it out. (Eph. 2:8-10) The three operations of faith are as follows:,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Kuhesabuliwa kuwahaki ni kwa imani. Kwa sababu sheria haiwezi kuhesabu kuwa haki, taraja tu ya mtu ni &ldquo;Haki bila shema&rdquo; (warumi 3:21).

Hiyo ndiyo &ldquo;Haki ya Mungu&rdquo; (Haki ambao Mungu ametolea), na imekuwa kipawa kwa sababu mtu amekosa mamlaka ya kuikomalisha ao kuitimiza. (waefeso 2:8-10).
