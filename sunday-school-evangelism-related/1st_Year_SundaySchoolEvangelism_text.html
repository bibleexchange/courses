In fact, the Gospel accounts speak more often of Him as a teacher then they do as a preacher. Your commission and goal as a teacher is found in the words of Christ, &ldquo;Go ye therefore, and </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">teach</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> all nations&hellip;to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you&hellip; &rdquo; (Mathew 28:19, 20)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The evangelistic goal of the great commission is to teach people to &ldquo;observe all things&rdquo; or to put into practice the things that Jesus taught. Christ did far more than impart knowledge, but He made the eternal truths of God personal and practical. His teachings changed the lives of those he taught. In the same way, you are not teaching just facts, but principles that change the lives of your students. Your teaching ministry is a Holy calling.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You may not be called to stand up in a class to teach, but this should not hinder you from teaching. Your life is to be a walking, talking example of Christ. If you never stand in front of a group of students, your life should teach.

Successful Christian teaching involves a right relationship with God, personal talent, and preparation. Tools and techniques are important and a good teacher knows and uses them, but he is the key to their effectiveness in communicating spiritual truth. This is not to say the teacher is greater in importance than the Holy Ghost, but that the most important thing a teacher can do to make him effective is to yield </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">himself</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> to the leading of the Great Teacher&mdash;the Holy Ghost. (John 16:13)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The work of the teacher is filled with rich opportunities to help others and to influence lives. &nbsp;For the Christian teacher, eternal values are involved and </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">the teacher&#39;s life style becomes interwoven with the teaching process.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Christian Experience</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;At its simplest level, teaching is sharing with others that which has been experienced. &nbsp;To communicate Christ and His message, the teacher must know Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Learning from some of the world&#39;s greatest salesmen, namely, Paul, Luther, Wesley, Whitefield, Spurgeon, and Moody, it is said that these men were eminently successful as salesmen because </span><span class="csC382D2BB">they had implicit faith in the house they represented, and perfect confidence that its goods were absolutely needed</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. &nbsp;This inspired them with a courage and enthusiasm that demanded and secured attention. Success likewise, depends upon the enthusiasm the teacher has for the task, and his enthusiasm will be in proportion to his own </span><span class="csA657E9A2">personal faith</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Faith in God</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: The faith of a Christian teacher goes beyond simple belief in God. &nbsp;It must be an active, vital faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. It must be a triumphant, aggressive faith. The faith of an effective Christian teacher must be a working faith.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Faith in the Bible</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: Effective preachers, evangelists, and church teachers derive their convictions through unswerving faith in the written Word of God. &nbsp;God has written to man and the wonder of that message should stir the heart of every teacher.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Faith in God&#39;s Call</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">: A teacher must realize that he has been called by God to teach.

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Personality</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;A person who commits himself to God strengthens his own personality. Because of Paul&rsquo;s deep experience of the reality of the Gospel, he became more open about the needs of his own life and more concerned about the needs of others. Every Christian teacher needs to grow toward a mature, Christ-like personality.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">ENTHUSIASM is always vital to lesson preparation, because your excitement will overflow into your lesson plans. (The opposite is true, as well. If you are lackluster and disinterested, your lesson will reflect it.)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Example</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;A teacher&#39;s example either contradicts or underscores what he teaches. &nbsp;The teacher&#39;s attitude and the unplanned things he says and does make strong impressions on his pupils. &nbsp;The teacher may speak about love, but if he is unpleasant to others, he cannot teach with real results. &nbsp;The teacher&#39;s example is a vital part teaching.</span></li><li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Relationships</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The quality of the teacher&#39;s relationships with those he teaches also is a determining factor in his success. &nbsp;Long after facts are forgotten, the love of the teacher is remembered. &nbsp;A teacher cannot pretend concern for the welfare of his pupils, nor will a lack of it go unnoticed.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teacher who recognizes the importance of his position seeks to be qualified to fill his place and understands the need for preparation. A doctor will not have time to &quot;look it up&quot; when a patient&#39;s artery is severed and his life&#39;s blood is flowing away. He must know what to do or a life will be lost. &nbsp;Even more harmful is the blunder of a teacher who gives the wrong counsel regarding spiritual truths. &nbsp;Teaching periods are all too brief. &nbsp;Every minute must be turned to the best possible use. &nbsp;Only the trained teacher can utilize these precious moments to the best advantage. For this reason, every teacher needs adequate preparation in each of the following areas.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Bible</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;To teach the Bible effectively, a teacher needs a working knowledge of the sixty-six books. &nbsp;He should be familiar with all, especially as they relate to Christ. &nbsp;In his teaching, Paul frequently referred to Christ as the example to be followed. &nbsp;He gave down-to-earth examples from the life of Christ to encourage Christian living.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In order to teach love Paul said, &quot;Walk in love, as Christ also hath loves us, and hath given himself&hellip;&quot; &nbsp;He clarified the meaning of humility. &quot;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus&hellip;&quot; Rom. 15:3 </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Paul&#39;s teaching was successful because the Holy Spirit was his power. I Thessalonians 1:5 says that Paul spoke in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">power</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and in the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Holy Spirit</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. &nbsp;This empowerment was to present the Word. &nbsp;Today&#39;s teacher must teach the message of the Word of God faithfully and in the power of the Spirit. &nbsp;He is not called to teach a message from the Bible, but the message of the Bible. &nbsp;Only in this way would he change lives.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Related Subjects</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;In addition, you should be familiar with related subjects such as geography, history and ancient culture. Accurately describing the geographical settings will help your students understand various Bible events.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Students are greatly helped when their teacher is well informed about world historical events that parallel the narratives of the Bible. Many Bible events can be properly understood only in the light of their historical settings. Further, a knowledge of history will help students understand and appreciate how in &ldquo;the fullness of time revealed his plan for human redemption.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">Pupil Characteristics</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;You, as the teacher need to take advantage of every opportunity to understand the needs and background of those you teach. Then you can build on this broad understanding by getting to know individual students through meaningful records, planned class contacts and home visitation.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The responsibilities of a teacher can be a delight or drudgery. &nbsp;Systematic preparation procedures will enrich the entire teaching experience. &nbsp;The observance of the three following steps will increase effectiveness of preparation and teaching. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Right Attitude</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The teacher&#39;s attitude toward his responsibility will largely determine his success. &nbsp;He has accepted a teaching assignment, not only because of need, but because he is called of God. &nbsp;In exercising his gift of teaching, he sees the potential for change in the lives of other people. &nbsp;God will be working through him to accomplish the mission of the Church.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs468D3CFB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Self Preparation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;If a teacher is physically fit, mentally alert, spiritually alive, and socially adept he will find his class a satisfying pleasure.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Mentally Alert</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &mdash; The Bible says that &quot;</span><span class="csC382D2BB">And</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span><span class="csC382D2BB">Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man&quot;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> (Luke 2:52). This four-fold development is equally applicable today. &nbsp;&quot;Increased wisdom&quot; focuses on an alert mind which is essential to successful teaching. Today&#39;s students learn to reason logically. They, therefore, quickly come to resent superficial reasoning in church education. You must think intelligently, analyze carefully, and dare not be behind the times. Be sure also to read Christian magazines, current events, newspapers, devotional literature, and Christian fiction.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Physically Fit</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">	&mdash;</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">In addition, teaching can be greatly enhanced through vibrant, healthy bodies. It is difficult to teach enthusiastically when you do not feel well. Heredity and elements beyond your control will partly determine physical health. But because you as a Christian surrender your body to Christ, you will want to exercise constant discipline to maintain your health and strength.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Spiritually Alive</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> &mdash;</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Your personal relationship with God must be a priority for you to increase in &quot;favour with God.&quot; Study the Bible to learn the facts you need to teach. But more importantly, study the Bible in order to allow it to speak to your own spiritual needs. A time for personal daily devotions is essential. Every lesson should be immer.sed in prayer from the first steps of preparation to its conclusion and application to the lives of your students.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Socially Adept</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;</span><span class="cs3B0A1ABE"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Jesus also increased in &quot;favour with man.&quot; Paul wrote that &quot;none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself&quot; (Rom. 14:7). If you are to grow as a Christian and as a Christian teacher, you must grow in your ability to relate meaningfully to other persons. Your class members must see in you a deep sense of honesty, &nbsp;sympathy, and acceptance. Though you are concerned about working to change persons through the Word of God, you must not become a manipulator; but be willing to openly share yourself and that which God has given you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Lesson Preparation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Enthusiasm is always a prerequisite to lesson preparation because your excitement will overflow into your lesson plans. Certain hours should be set aside each week for lesson preparation. Teaching is a holy calling and its preparation must not be relegated to the spare moments that are left after everything else is done.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Time will be saved and far more will be accomplished if you establish a definite, clearly outlined pattern for study. Bible study opens many avenues of interest. You may be tempted to follow inviting bypaths that are not directly associated with the lesson. However, an orderly plan of procedure will make it possible to accomplish much more in a given period of time. Further information on lesson planning follows in later chapters.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teacher is the focal point of teaching. The basic question regarding effective teaching relates to the teacher himself. &nbsp;Answering &quot;Who am I?&quot; precedes answering &quot;What skills do I possess?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teaching function of the church has its origin in God. &nbsp;He calls persons to teach and provides the enabling spiritual gifts. Believers are commissioned by God to lead men to Christ and then to teach them to apply God&#39;s Word to their lives. You not only must know Christ as Savior; but must exhibit faith that works and faith in God&#39;s Word. Your personality, personal example, and relationships are yielded to God so that students can see and benefit from the attitudes and actions presented. Knowledge of the Bible, geography, history, ancient culture, contemporary conditions, and student characteristics offer you well-rounded information in preparing and presenting lessons. A positive attitude and adequate personal preparation will also prepare you to share, with the Holy Spirit&#39;s guidance, the eternal message of God&#39;s Word.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="csFE951EFD">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A teaching aim leads to teaching achievement. Why teach? &nbsp;Why all the lesson preparation and class sessions? &nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Bible states that believers should be &quot;teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.&quot; &nbsp;(Col.1:28) &nbsp;&nbsp;If this broad goal is to be achieved, aims for each lesson must be determined early in lesson preparation and clearly stated.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823125"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Value of Aims</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">An aim is a clear statement of what the teacher hopes to accomplish by teaching the lesson. </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">The aim has several purposes. &nbsp;1)It gives direction to the lesson and helps determine the teaching method to be employed. 2)It leads to the wise use of class time. 3)It helps in planning, teaching, and evaluating.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In Planning</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Every aspect of the teaching hour should lead toward fulfillment of the established aim. &nbsp;The teaching plan proceeds step by step through introduction, content material, conclusion, and application with each part relating to the aim. &nbsp;Without a stated aim the entire lesson may be as haphazard as the first raindrops in a summer storm. &nbsp;</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The aim also helps determine the teaching method that will be used. On the basis of a clearly stated aim, the teacher effectively selects methods and materials. The activities of the class vary with different aims. &nbsp;Whether to lecture, tell a story, or introduce a discussion is determined on the basis of aims. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A project may help students acquire certain skills. A word-by-word study of the text may help them increase their understanding of a doctrine. A general discussion about a critical question may provide greater tolerance of different points of view. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In Teaching</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;A clearly defined aim also allows the teacher greater flexibility in the class presentation. &nbsp;Changing conditions in the classroom, the unexpected questions, the sudden interest in a special topic, even the time to close can best be handled by the teacher who has an aim clearly in mind. &nbsp;Each element that appears becomes an additional opportunity to direct pupils toward the achievement of the lesson aim.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">In Evaluating</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;One of the great needs for the Christian teacher is to be able to evaluate the results of his teaching. &nbsp;Evaluation is a necessary part of all teaching activities. &nbsp;In order to be able to measure results, a clear teaching aim is required. &nbsp;Few pleasures compare with the joy of the teacher who sees helpful changes taking place in the lives of his class members. &nbsp;As he recognizes these to be a fulfillment o his teaching aims, he is encouraged to serve the Lord with greater zeal and enthusiasm</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823126"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Basis for Aims</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are essentially two bases for determining a teaching aim: 1) the content of the biblical portion of the lesson that is being taught and 2) the needs of the students.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Word of God</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;To determine Biblical aims it is necessary for the teacher to become a serious student of the Bible. &nbsp;He will read and reread the passage until it becomes a part of his life. &nbsp;He will seek to understand the content and the situation in which it was written so that he can clearly state the objective truth it offers.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs468D3CFB"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Class Members</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Another basis for the teaching aim is the need of the learner. A teacher must be careful to establish aims that are true to the text and also apply to the learner&#39;s situation.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Establishing teaching aims directed to the situation of the pupils is a great responsibility. &nbsp;In the final analysis the teacher will determine what will happen in the classroom. &nbsp;Unless he is willing to take the time and expend the effort to know his class members, his effectiveness will be seriously limited. &nbsp;He must spend much time in prayer to seek God&#39;s will concerning which truth of the Bible he will emphasize and which needs of the learners he will seek to meet.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

He should pray for each pupil and seek to bring him to a clear, Biblical faith in Christ. &nbsp;Such decisions may come spontaneously as the culmination of careful teaching. &nbsp;The teacher should never use artificial, high-pressure methods, especially in dealing with young children. Acceptance of Christ as Savior is the first step toward a full life. &nbsp;Seek to lead those who receive Christ to continuous growth in Christian living.</span></li></ol>

Such training requires that pupils be given opportunity to worship as a means of expression. &nbsp;The Word of God bears a vital relationship to such instruction. &nbsp;The entire Bible abounds in expressions that provide acceptable form of devotion.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The impartation of knowledge does not complete the Christian educational process. &nbsp;For education to be effective, it must lead to action. &nbsp;Christian education in the deepest sense takes place in a God-conscious atmosphere. &nbsp;If the Holy Spirit is present to inform, to convict, and to inspire &hellip; if He has breathed on the teacher and the pupils, there will be a sense of alertness, aliveness, and anticipation that otherwise will be lacking.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Christian character is formed as people respond in obedience to the Word of God. &nbsp;The teacher has the responsibility of imparting the WORD. &nbsp;As God speaks, pupils will respond, and the Holy Spirit will effect growth in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Aims are more easily accomplished if they are clearly defined and written prior to the lesson presentation. They should be achievable and the degree to which the aim is achieved should be measurable.

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Summary</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Clearly defined aims are essential and are valuable in planning, teaching, and evaluating lessons. Aims are established from the Bible and from the needs of the class members. General aims of every teacher are to lead students to confess Christ as Lord and Savior and to grow in Christian maturity toward Christ-likeness. These general aims become effective in the teaching-learning process as they are translated into specific lesson aims on the basis of the Scripture passage and the needs of the students. The specific types of aims for teaching effectiveness are to increase knowledge, to improve attitudes, and to change behavior.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">What is the </span><span class="csC382D2BB">best </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">teaching method? The answer: the one that is most effective in accomplishing the lesson aim. Every carpenter&#39;s tool has its proper use. A carpenter does not use a saw to drive a nail, level a beam, or measure a board. In the same way, a teacher does not use the same teaching method for every teaching situation.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are at least two reasons why any one method is overused. First, many teachers tend to teach in the same manner they were taught. If they were taught by the lecture method, when they become teachers, lecture is the method they use. Secondly, many teachers tend to overuse one method as a matter of habit. They feel secure in familiar situations and often go to great lengths to resist change.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Recognizing that there are many effective teaching methods, will improve your teaching. Understand also that change does not have to be threatening, but can help you feel more secure in your teaching. In this chapter, teacher-centered methods are presented. The next chapter deals with methods that involve more direct student participation.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B07DF"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The most widely used teaching method is the lecture.

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Telling a story is a favorite</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">method of teaching children; however, it can be used effectively with any age group. &nbsp;Jesus was a master storyteller; His stories are unsurpassed.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Advantages</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Storytelling has many advantages. It captures and holds students&#39; attention, making the past come alive so they can better experience it. Students also can identify with the characters and, in the process, learn to imitate or avoid those characters&#39; actions.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs468D3CFB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Obstacles</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;There are some obstacles to be aware of in storytelling, as well. Some biblical passages do not readily lend themselves to storytelling, especially those that are strongly doctrinal. The storyteller must also be able to dramatize and tell the story at the students&#39; ability level or it will either be too difficult or boring.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs468D3CFB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Improving Story Telling</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;A good story is </span><span class="cs31B015EA">interesting, dramatic, full of action, and true to life</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. &nbsp;Because narratives arouse interest at the outset, there is probably no better method to gain and hold attention. &nbsp;The Bible as a whole is a thrilling, fascinating message, much of which can be presented in story form. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sentences must be short and language kept simple. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">By </span><span class="cs31B015EA">look, gesture, and facial expression</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> the teacher portrays truth, gaining immediate attention through the eye gate. A good story is action packed. &nbsp;It is full of action, but not full of words. &nbsp;Often action is intensified by the restriction of words. &nbsp;The stories Jesus told emphasize achievement. &nbsp;He does not take time to describe His characters, but each character is clearly pictured by his deeds. &nbsp;The story of the Good Samaritan in Luke 10 illustrates this principle.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The impossible seldom appeals. It is the element of reality that characterizes Bible stories and makes them superior to all others. &nbsp;Storytelling provides the pupil with an opportunity to </span><span class="cs31B015EA">share</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> in the experiences of people of the past. &nbsp;He can feel the pain of Adam and Eve as they are driven out of Eden. &nbsp;He can sense the despair of David as he cries for his son, Absalom. &nbsp;He can share in the joy of the father as he embraces his prodigal son.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Several important factors must be kept in mind if one is to become an effective storyteller: Careful choice, study of the story itself and perhaps of its background, outlining its characters and the sequence of events, memorize key or pithy statements, practice the telling (at least once aloud), telling it in a relaxed fashion and with enjoyment. Stories do not just happen. &nbsp;They develop with hard work and diligent practice. &nbsp;In every story a certain structure must be observed. &nbsp;There is an </span><span class="cs31B015EA">introduction, growing action, the climax, and a quick ending.</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Beginning</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The beginning of the story must gain interest, introduce the main characters, and get the action started. &nbsp;(Luke 15:11,12 provides the beginning of the story.)</span></li><li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Growing Action</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. A series of rhetorical (for effect) questions and answers, problems and solutions are used to capture the attention of the listener. &nbsp;In the prodigal son we see the main character leave home, go bankrupt, and come to his self in quick sequence. &nbsp;The action increases until the listeners feel that they must know the outcome.</span></li><li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Climax</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. What is the final Answer? &nbsp;Will the son really apologize? &nbsp;Will his father throw him out? &nbsp;He certainly deserves it! &nbsp;But to our amazement &quot;his father&hellip; ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.&quot;</span></li><li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Ending</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. The ending is short and to the point. &nbsp;It provides a picture of the final outcome and then stops.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Illustrations lead students to understand unfamiliar terms. The parables of Jesus are excellent examples of verbal illustrations.

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Figures of speech</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> illustrate a thought by making comparison. For an example, similes or metaphors are figures of speech. A simile is a comparison using &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;as.&rdquo; A metaphor is a more direct comparison such as, &ldquo;I am the door&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am the true vine&rdquo; (John 10:9; 15:1).</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Allusions</span><span class="cs31B015EA"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">referring to historical, literary or scientific data may also be used to illustrate your lessons. The Apostle Paul made allusions to law, architecture, athletics, and etc. Limit the use of allusions and other types of verbal illustrations with younger students. An illustration travels from the known into the unknown; therefore, use illustrations relative to your students.</span></p><p class="cs4D363080"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Bible illustrations help refresh the students&#39; memories of scriptural events and fix them more permanently in their minds.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Personal experiences</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> also afford many valuable teaching illustrations. These can usually be presented vividly and dramatically.

Illustrations are everywhere if you train yourself to look for them. Finding illustrations is sometimes easy, but remembering them until they are needed is often difficult. Some teachers collect illustration ideas in notebooks or scrapbooks. Others prefer note cards that can be filed by subject matter or by Scripture text.</span><span class="csD33053A"> &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 310pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An illustration should be </span><span class="cs31B015EA">clear</span><span class="csC382D2BB">, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">depicting the meaning of the truth being taught. It should be based on something familiar to students.

If half the lesson time is spent on one illustration, it is too long.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Effective illustrations will be</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span><span class="cs31B015EA">fresh</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">and new. Even a good illustration, if it is overused, will become dull. The freshness of an illustration drawn from a current event will appeal to students.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Illustrations should be </span><span class="cs31B015EA">dignified</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">and</span><span class="csC382D2BB"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">appropriate for the spiritual truth being conveyed. Purity of life and thought must always match purity of doctrine. At the same time, teachers should not rule out humorous illustrations. Sometimes these are very effective. Jesus&#39; parable about the excuses given by those who had been invited to the supper certainly must have had his audience laughing before he finished (Luke 14: 16-20).</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823133"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Participation</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Learning is more than listening. Students who only listen to stories or lectures tend to become intellectually lazy. Listening should lead to active participation. Students must become involved if they are to completely understand the lesson and be able to reproduce it in their own words. At its best, education is a drawing-out process. Participation helps achieve this goal.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If students are to participate, they must learn to study on their own. This enables the students to come to class with some familiarity with the subject. It also provides the teacher an opportunity to learn how much the students know about the subject or to identify errors that may have developed in their thinking. Advance preparation and oral presentation in class help students clarify their own thinking. Mentally lazy students should be challenged with more active participation.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">No participation is very successful if conducted simply as routine. To insist that students merely repeat the facts of the lesson in the language of the textbook encourages mental laziness.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">The Assignment</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The teacher&#39;s attitude will largely determine whether an assignment is boring or exciting. If you are obviously excited about the lesson, this enthusiasm will be caught by your students. One way to arouse interest is to help students see benefits they will enjoy by completing the assignments. Assignments within the range of individual abilities and available time are more likely to be completed. It is also a good idea to enlist the interest and aid of children&#39;s parents. In adult classes, students may be encouraged to complete assignments in areas of personal interest.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Pupil Preparation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;If assignments are to lead to successful participation, they must be clearly understood by all students and assigned far enough in advance so that there is ample time for preparation. It is also important that students have the resources available to them such as Bibles and other references needed. Students need to feel that assignments will benefit them.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs468D3CFB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Class Participation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Time should be allowed for class contributions on the basis of assignments. &nbsp;If time is divided judiciously there can be wide participation. &nbsp;Each contribution should be related to the overall lesson emphasis. &nbsp;Sharing discoveries of those well-prepared pupils benefits all.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This chapter focuses on student-centered methods of teaching. Because some people feel that the teacher is the central focus of the lesson, the teacher-centered methods are sometimes more widely used than student-centered methods. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Examples of the student-centered method are found in John 3 and 4 (Nicodemus and Samaritan woman). Jesus, the perfect teacher, also used debate when His authority was challenged by His critics in Matthew 21:13-25, 46. He also assigned a project when He sent the 12 out on a preaching mission in Matthew 10. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Advantages in using student centered teaching: To relieve you of the responsibility of being an all knowing authority; you become a co-learner instead. The more involved the students are, the more they learn and the longer they retain what they learned.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Why is student method teaching? Student method teaching is concerned not only with present facts but with helping students change attitudes. Student centered methods are often more successful in producing attitude changes. Student centered methods rarely produce results automatically. Do not get discouraged; keep trying!</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Advantages</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Group discussion has several advantages: It involves the students directly in the teaching-learning process. It encourages the expression of various viewpoints and it brings out erroneous ideas that the teacher may need to counteract at once, in later class sessions, or in private. It clarifies unclear thinking because students have to express concepts in their own words; and it helps students develop a sense of camaraderie and responsibility for developing the lesson.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Obstacles</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Group discussion takes more time than the lecture method, and as a result, probably should not be used when the main lesson aim is to pass along a considerable amount of factual data. The discussion can be dominated by one or two outspoken or opinionated class members. Timid members, who often have some excellent ideas, may not get an opportunity to express themselves. A discussion can ramble far from the topic. The discussion method is not very effective in large classes. Ordinarily the teacher will not use it if the class numbers more than 20 or 25(unless sub groups are used.) </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Improving the Discussion</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;If at all possible, chairs should be arranged in a circle or around a table so that students may face one another. Design a stimulating subject or provocative question. A subject which interests only a few students is not likely to produce a lively discussion. Create the proper atmosphere in the classroom. Consider yourself a co-learner, not an authority figure who intimidates the other learners. Spend a few minutes at the close of the lesson period summarizing what was said. One student might keep a record of how many times each person spoke. A report on this will tend to spotlight those who talk too much and those who have not spoken at all. Such a report will often help correct such situations without anyone having to criticize the persons involved.</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823137"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Panel and Panel Forum</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 47.75pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 47.75pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The panel format consists of two or more persons discussing various aspects of a subject in front of the class. A moderator presides over and guides the discussion. The panel forum format enlarges upon this by allowing the class members to raise questions or enter the discussion after the panelists have made their presentations.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Advantages</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The panelists have an opportunity to make adequate preparation for the discussion. The most effective panels consist of panelists who are experts in their field.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Various viewpoints and information will usually be presented by having several panelists that might not be possible with only one speaker. The different personalities of the panelists are more likely to hold student interest. The viewpoints and information presented by the panelists can provide a basis for a more enlightened discussion by the rest of the class. Panels and panel forums can be used with very large classes. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs31B015EA">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Obstacles</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The panel and panel forum techniques will not automatically produce effective learning. They take time, a serious problem when the lesson period is limited. Panelists who are experts and capable of communicating at the level of the class members are not always available. Since panelists are speaking from different viewpoints, the ideas may not always be presented in an orderly manner and might confuse the students.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Improving the Panel and Panel Form&mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">The moderator is the key to a successful panel. He introduces the discussion, maintains order, keeps the discussion flowing, and focuses it on the subject. He also directs the discussion that involves the other class members and should make provision for a summary at the close of the session.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Choose a subject that interests members of the class. Also, select panelists so that various aspects of the subject are discussed. Students lose interest when all the speakers agree.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823138"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Drama</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Drama is effective for students of all age levels. It may be used to illustrate a biblical event or to depict the application of a Bible truth. Drama used in teaching may be prepared formally, or it can arise spontaneously within the classroom setting.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Advantages&mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Properly used, drama has the advantage of involving students in the teaching-learning process. This causes Bible stories to come alive and take on deeper meaning for the students and helps them remember the material longer.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Drama also provides an outlet for students&#39; energies, especially smaller children. A bit of spontaneous drama can channel their activities into something creative rather than allowing them to become sources of discipline problems.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Obstacles&mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">Ordinarily, the presentation of a major dramatic production requires much preparation: considerable time, costumes, props, and staging. Also, sometimes effective drama requires having an experienced director, capable assistants, and talented students. Because of this, many teachers do not use major dramatic presentations as part of their teaching.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Using Drama&mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teacher who thinks of drama as an elaborate, time-consuming presentation will understandably reject it for use in the classroom. But drama need not be so elaborate to be useful in Christian teaching.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Short skits can be used in the classroom to illustrate a biblical scene, costumes and props being kept to a minimum. In this use of drama, it is not necessary to spend much time in practicing. Keep in mind that the purpose is to teach Christian truths, not impress the viewers with a professional presentation. Most children, even when they appear shy, enjoy performing in a drama. Christian camps for years have made Bible dramas a highlight of the students&#39; camping experience.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Be alert to possibilities for spontaneous dramatic actions to capture and hold student attention. For example, in the story of David and Goliath, two students could be asked to dramatize the scene. Or the stoning of Stephen could be portrayed. One student could play the part of Stephen while the others bombarded him with &quot;stones&quot; made of wadded up newspaper.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823139"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Field Trip</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A field trip takes the students out of the classroom. It gives them the opportunity to visit places or situations where they can see things or activities first hand or even have a &quot;hands on&quot; experience. Properly conducted, such experiences can given them insights into Bible truths or stimulate spiritual growth.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Field trips may involve a few hours and traveling several miles. Thus they are not usually conducted during a typical class period. On the other hand, a field trip could be no more elaborate than a walk to the back of the church parking lot.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Advantages</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The greatest advantage of a field trip is that students are involved in a firsthand experience. A teacher may lecture at length about God&#39;s hand in nature; but such a lecture is not likely to be as effective as a short trip to the church yard. There students may see a flower in bloom, an ant hill, or a cocoon-a far more vivid experience than merely hearing about them or seeing pictures of them. A field trip also often encourages, students to do further study on their own and it can be used with students of almost any age.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Obstacles</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;There are several obstacles to the use of field trips. Extensive field trips take considerable time, planning, and expense. Also, not all lessons can effectively use the field trip and appropriate places to visit may not be readily available.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Success</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Before planning a trip, consider the lesson aims and decide whether they can be achieved by a field trip. Aimless activity alone does not make for good Christian teaching. Allow the students to share in the planning. They will be more enthusiastic about what they plan, and often contribute good ideas.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The teacher should plan well in advance for the trip. This includes clearing the activity with the church, making arrangements with the place to be visited, and arranging for transportation and meals, if necessary. Be sure also to keep the group small enough to be manageable and enlist enough help. This is important not only for good teaching but for safety. When taking minors on trips away from the church property, you will also need to get written permission from parents or guardians.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823140"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Project</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The project method can be used successfully in Christian education. A project is a purposeful activity that students plan because they are interested in it. The project should have practical application as well as teaching value. Usually it is started or at least planned in the class session and then completed at home.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Projects give students opportunity to learn by doing. Cooperation, tolerance of others&#39; opinions, initiative, responsibility, alertness, and judgment are developed. Projects also strengthen character and provide opportunities to acquire and develop skills.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The research project helps students become independent investigators. The teacher assigns the class members a part of the lesson to investigate for themselves and makes sure that resources are available to help them complete the project. During the lesson period class members may present their reports. These are then discussed, evaluated, and organized under the direction of the teacher. This is especially effective for older children through adult classes.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The service project involves students in activities that benefit others. There is no limit to the variety of projects that students can accomplish, nor are these projects limited to any particular age level. Even small children can undertake activities that will help others. Usually students work together on service projects. Some suggestions for projects might be: running errands for the handicapped, visiting the aged, raking leaves for a disabled person, painting a church classroom. These projects can then be discussed during the next class session.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823141"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Inductive Bible Study</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Inductive Bible study, which is very profitable in individual study, may also be used as a group method of instruction. The inductive method leads participants to discover Bible truths themselves. When inductive Bible study is used with a group, the teacher serves primarily as a coordinator and resource person.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">There are three steps in the inductive method: observation (what does it say?); interpretation (what does it mean?); and application (what does it mean to me?).</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Observation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The first step in inductive Bible study for either individuals or groups is to discover exactly what the author has written. The students must attempt to lay aside any preconceived ideas they might have about the passage and approach it with an open mind.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">One method is for students to write the Scripture passage in one column verse by verse, and phrase by phrase. In a second column observations can be recorded. A third column can then be used for students to write questions they might have. Observations and questions then become the basis for group discussion. When students complete this work prior to class time, a good basis for discussion has been laid.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Interpretation</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The second step in inductive Bible study is interpretation. The purpose of this is to discover the meaning the author wished to convey. A series of questions may help at this point: Who is the author? When did he write? Under what circumstances did he write? To whom did he write? Why did he write?</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After these questions have been discussed, other questions may arise. Students as well as the teacher should be involved in this process. Sometimes it is necessary to define key words in the passage. Dictionaries ought to be available to the students for this purpose. <br/>Reading the passage in several different translations, noting similarities and differences will often help.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The best interpretation of any scriptural passage is the Bible itself. Thus it is handy to have available Bibles with cross references or topical references. Commentaries may be used, but it is best to resort to these only after adequate study by the class members.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">In a few statements the main meaning of the Bible passage can then be summarized by each person individually or in small groups.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Application</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The third step in inductive Bible study is often the most difficult because it confronts the participants with God&#39;s message. No longer are they merely seeking to understand. Now they must decide to obey or disobey. This requires prayer and faith but leads to changed lives. You can encourage right decisions by permitting time for sharing among class members.</span></li></ol>

			<span class="csCF6BBF71">You should be aware of the advantages of using the following student-centered teaching methods. The group discussion encourages every member of the class to participate. The panel can be used to bring expert information into the discussion, while drama enlivens Bible truths and directs student energies into useful channels. The field trip allows students to learn outside the classroom and to share in a first hand learning experience. The project gets the students involved in research or in useful Christian service. Inductive Bible study stimulates the students to seek new insights into and application of scriptural passages.</span></h3>

Some leadership education courses give more attention to the methods of the teacher, than to the message of the Word of God. In Christian education it is important that the teacher know the Word of God. &nbsp;Knowledge is the material with which the teacher works. &nbsp;Imperfect knowledge will be reflected in imperfect teaching. &nbsp;What a man does not know, he cannot teach. &nbsp;It has been said: &quot;Know thoroughly and familiarly the lesson you wish to teach, teach from a full mind and a clear understanding. The teacher should know more than he has time to teach; not just enough to fill the time. &nbsp;The teacher who masters his subject can be at ease as he directs the class in its thought and active participation. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Long before Spurgeon became a great preacher, he was a successful children&#39;s worker. &nbsp;In his instruction to his teachers he said, &quot;Get the children&#39;s attention. &nbsp;If they do not hearken, you may talk, but you will speak to no purpose whatever. &nbsp;If they do not listen, you go through your labors as an unmeaning drudgery to yourselves and your pupils too. &nbsp;You can do nothing without securing their attention. Gain and keep the attention, and interest of the pupils upon the lesson. &nbsp;Do not try to teach without attention.&quot;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

Primary children will have an increasingly lengthened period of sustained attention. &nbsp;They begin to appreciate their own abilities and to enjoy longer periods of thought or discussion. By the middle of the first grade or during the second grade, well-trained school pupils begin to make the transition from much physical activity to the enjoyment of mental activity. Their attention span becomes noticeably lengthened. &nbsp;At any grade level the wise teacher seeks first to gain attention, then to retain it, and finally to turn attention into interest.</span></li></ol>

He has learned to deal with his own thoughts as well as the thoughts of others. &nbsp;Failure to insist on original thinking is a most common fault of untrained teachers. A good teacher seldom asks the question, &ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo;, but asks, &ldquo;Why&hellip;?&rdquo; This way, the pupil learns to think for himself. &nbsp;</span></li></ol>

Applying knowledge affects the will and transforms the life of the learner. If practical, personal application is neglected, pupils will be &quot;ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.&quot; (II Timothy 4:7) &nbsp;This is mere &quot;head knowledge&quot; and does not result in the life-changing, transforming operation of the grace of God.</span></li></ol>

Not to review is to leave teaching incomplete. &nbsp;</span></li></ol>

It should be used with the Bible, never as a substitute for it and should not be prominent in the actual presentation.

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Current Sources</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;There are innumerable sources for enriching lessons. Several of these include life experiences, libraries and current events in magazines, newspapers, radio, etc. When you are resourceful, you encourage resourcefulness in your students.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers, like newspaper reporters, should be alert to new materials. In devotional study; in reading of books, magazines, and newspapers and in every personal contact you should be gathering material for long-range lesson preparation.</span></p><p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Plans for Future Lessons</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;In carefully planned curricula, each lesson is related to those preceding and those following. Taken together, they develop a complete theme. Each study must be related to the general theme for the entire unit.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To assure full, active class participation you must make assignments in advance of the lesson. This cannot be done unless you have given considerable time to long-range planning and study. Consideration of future lessons is both practical and essential to the teacher&rsquo;s success.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Provide for Needs of Individual Students</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;As materials are selected, you should be aware of the needs of the entire class and keep a clear focus on individual needs.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Meet Your Personal Needs</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;If you are to improve your effectiveness, you must continue to grow both spiritually and intellectually. To do this, you learn to read selectively, systematically, and intelligently. As you extend your own vision, increase your own knowledge, deepen your own spirituality, and vitalize your own faith your students will drink from rivers of living water rather than from stagnant pools.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Accumulating Material</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Some claim that 90 percent of the ideas entering the mind are soon forgotten. One eminent educator believes that most ideas are lost in the first 24 hours. Provision should therefore be made for gathering and conserving worthwhile materials.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Paint Mental Pictures</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;If you can present facts vividly, you will appeal to your students&#39; imaginations. But you cannot show students what you yourself do not see. For this reason, lesson material should be reproduced in mental pictures. During your preparation, occasionally close your eyes and form vivid pictures of the scenes and persons about whom you have been reading. This will develop your ability to visualize and will make your teaching more creative.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Provide a Notebook</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Writing helps the memory retain information and preserves it for future use. Recording and filing materials make them available at a later time. If you faithfully follow a systematic way of preserving this information, over the years you will accumulate a vast wealth of teaching material.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="cs9FFD4C36"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For General Information&mdash;Never read without thinking; never think without writing. When you find something worthwhile, copy it into a notebook or on note cards along with information about the source so that it can be quickly relocated when needed. Many teachers underline important passages or use a special felt-tip pen to make them easier to find.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Facts and statistics are valuable. They form a foundation and a strong resource for class discussion. Quotations from representative leaders and educators carry authority. Information about the latest discoveries and inventions inspire wide-awake classes.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Personal experiences and human interest stories make lessons come alive and give them emotional appeal. Many are related to the spiritual realm: answers to prayer; reports of God&#39;s providence; demonstrations of God&#39;s power; missionary adventure. These are most effective if they are related to some class member or generally known as current news events. All pertinent information should be recorded correctly, including names, dates, places, and sources of information.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs9FFD4C36"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For Specific Lessons&mdash;Your notebook or card file is valuable in planning for future lessons. Prior to each quarter, survey the entire series of lessons and look for ways to strengthen each one. If you learn to use your file of material, you will soon come to regard it as one of your most important teaching aids.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB" style="tab-stops:left 290.4pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is helpful to have a notebook with at least one page for each lesson of the coming quarter. Some suggest a notebook covering an entire year. Each page could indicate the lesson title and Scripture reference. As you observe or discover illustrative material, copy it on the appropriate page and thereby store up good teaching material for the future.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB" style="tab-stops:left 290.4pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="7" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Build a File</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;In addition to a notebook of ideas and illustrations, a file of pictures, object lessons, tests, student activities, and other visual aids is useful. This material can be used again and again with different classes. The material may be filed according to the Scripture references or by seasonal themes such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Resurrection Sunday. Students can be encouraged to help collect material for this file as well.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Summary</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Gathering lesson materials is a challenging and rewarding experience. You must constantly be on the alert for material which will enhance your teaching. The Bible and related Bible study aids should always be near at hand as they are basic study tools.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Selection of material is effective when it becomes a systematic, planned process with future lessons, and student and teacher needs are kept in mind.

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 404.15pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">An instructional aid is any device that helps teachers communicate more effectively with their students. Instructional aids are valuable for several reasons. First, they help overcome the language barrier in teaching. Most teaching is verbal, either written or oral; yet increasingly our culture emphasizes visual learning. Aids help capture and hold student attention and make learning more rapid, thus making more efficient use of class time. Students remember longer what they have learned when the aural sense is reinforced by the visual. Traditionally, instructional aids have been classified either as </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">impressional</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> or </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">expressional</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823155"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Impressional Aids</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Impressional aids are used to create impressions on the students. Among the <br/>impressional aids that you will find effective are audio devices, visuals, and audio-visuals.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs3485825C"><span class="cs91EF8B52">AUDIO AIDS</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Sound is vital to communication and equipment such as tape, compact disc and digital recorders and players can be used profitably in church education. Recordings are available on a variety of subjects such as Bible and life application stories. Recorded music might be used to set moods for the lesson, to teach new songs, or to accompany singing when an instrumental accompanist is not available. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">VISUAL AIDS</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Visuals reach the student through the eyes as well as the ears. One value of visuals is that students who fail to grasp a truth orally may be able to comprehend it through visual means. Included in this category are objects and models, maps and globes, pictures, bulletin boards, chalkboards and flipcharts, flannel graph, puppets, and projectors using </span><span class="csC382D2BB">PowerPoint</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> or transparencies.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs771400ED"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Objects and Models</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Objects and models are tangible items used to help illustrate spiritual truth. A small object such as a coin, stone, or paper is easily used. Jesus frequently used objects in his teaching. When he wanted to teach his followers about the qualities they&#39; should possess, he set a child in their midst as an object lesson. On another occasion, when his enemies tried to trap him on the issue of paying tribute to Caesar, he called for a coin, which he then used as an object to make his point. A well-equipped church should also have among its materials a collection of models such as the tabernacle, temple, as well as missionary artifacts. Bible models add background and substance to the Biblical records and descriptions of life in ancient times and missionary artifacts provide realism.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Maps and Globes</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Maps and globes help students become familiar with mission fields and Bible geography. The journeys of the patriarchs, the wanderings of Israel, or the campaigns of Joshua and David cannot be followed without the use of maps. Every class, therefore, should have a good set of Bible maps available. Small maps in Bibles, classroom wall maps, and maps on overhead transparencies are all helpful aids for effective teaching.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Pictures</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The skillful use of pictures results in successful instruction. Some of the great works of art depict Bible scenes. Students may need help in interpreting a picture&#39;s message and its relationship to the lesson emphasis. Too much attention to details of a picture will cause the students to remember the picture more than the lesson. Often pictures are left up for several weeks after the lesson has been taught helping the students review previous lessons.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Bulletin Boards</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Often known as the classroom &quot;silent teacher,&quot; bulletin boards use good visual form, attractive colors, and effective pictures to communicate information. A bulletin board can emphasize, remind, review, introduce, or announce a variety of subjects. Bulletin boards should be kept current and fresh for maximum impact on the viewers. To add to their learning value, students can be involved in creating and constructing them.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Chalkboard, Marker-board and Flip Chart</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Every classroom should have a chalkboard or marker-board. If commercially prepared boards are beyond the budget, inexpensive boards may be made by applying special chalkboard paint to a piece of hardboard. Flip charts, chalkboards and marker-boards may be used by teachers to draw diagrams, outlines, and sketches step by step. Even the teacher&#39;s action while using these aids helps sustain attention. It is not necessary to be a professional artist to make good use of a these aids. A short line, a few stick figures, a circle, or a square can represent people, cities, or events. Five things to remember when using these aids are:</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ul style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs4FC7BF42"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Avoid too much detail.</span></li><li class="cs4FC7BF42"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Don&#39;t block the view.</span></li><li class="cs4FC7BF42"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Write legibly, but quickly.</span></li><li class="cs4FC7BF42"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Stand at the side of your work</span></li></ul>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Talk while writing, but do not talk to the board. Teachers will also at times have the students use the flip chart or chalkboard. Student participation will help them remember the lesson longer.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Flannel graph</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Flannel graph is a very versatile instructional aid. While it is most frequently used in young children&#39;s classes, it can also be effective with youth and adults.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">This medium secures attention at the very outset and, as new factors appear, interest is sustained. At the end of the lesson, the class may repeat the story, placing the figures on the board. This activity combines the faculties of hearing, seeing, and doing.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Frank G. Coleman, in </span><span class="csC382D2BB">The Romance of Winning Children, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">points out three basics which must be mastered if the flannel graph is to be used successfully&mdash;dexterity, suspense, and movement. First, to have </span><span class="csC382D2BB">dexterity, </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">you need to practice the story in advance so that it flows swiftly and smoothly. The figures should be arranged in advance in the order in which they will be used. If backgrounds are to be changed during the story, these should be laid out or arranged so that the change can be made without interrupting the story. Talk as you work, but be sure to maintain eye contact with your students. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="7" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Transparencies and </span><span class="cs31B015EA">PowerPoint</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Some teachers use blank sheets of acetate and .special transparency pens to trace outlines or write comments as they teach. Many teachers find the use of a projector and a </span><span class="csC382D2BB">PowerPoint</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> presentation very effective in teaching.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:right 309.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:right 309.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A distinction is often made between aids that are primarily impressional and those that are expressional. Impressional aids include all things teachers do to make an impression on students in order to stimulate them to mental activity. Expression, however, involves students in various activities that allow them to express some aspect of the lesson they are learning. Expressional activities allow teachers to evaluate what students have really learned.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 21.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To be effective, you must provide expressional activities that involve careful thinking, reasoning, analyzing, evaluating, and summarizing. This active involvement of the mind and will urges students to become &quot;doers of the word&quot; (James 1:22).</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Expressional activities are part of good teaching. They are effective because they supplement the personality and skill of the instructor, and assist students in learning.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Impressional aids help to reach and stimulate-the student&#39;s mind but they do not necessarily secure a response. Expressional activities are effective because they deepen impression, capitalize on energy, and reach the personality in such a way as to bring lasting change in the students&#39; lives.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Children will often forget what they hear and they may forget what they have seen, but they will not soon forget what they have done. Learning is a process of .listening, looking, and doing. As students express themselves they re-impress their own minds and learn the truth through a different sense channel-not only through sight and sound, but also through activity. Learning begins and continues in what the learner does. Students taking piano lessons receive certain impressions when the teacher demonstrates a musical selection, but they don&#39;t begin to learn until they practice it for themselves.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Effective expressional activities will have a positive effect on the shaping of the lesson and the lives of the students. The objective of Christian teaching is the development of Christian character and living. This requires the appropriation and application of knowledge which is encouraged by the use of expressional activities. Two very important expressional aids are student activity books and handwork projects.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs12625CAB"><a name="_Toc242823157"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Student Activity Books</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Student activity books are important expressional aids and are included in most commercially-prepared curricula. They represent and set the pace for the students&#39; response to instruction. These materials are only a means to an end, however, and not the end. The activities contained in these books are not just busywork to keep students occupied, but are designed to help students learn by involvement and response.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs12625CAB"><a name="_Toc242823158"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Handcrafts</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is estimated that students remember 10 percent of what they hear, 50 percent of what they see, 70 percent of what they say, and 90 percent of what they do. For this reason, you should look upon handcrafts as an important part of your teaching, not just something to hold students&#39; interests or keep them quiet. Choose handcrafts carefully so that they reinforce the lesson aims.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Handcrafts may be used during pre-session periods to help prepare students for the lesson. Since younger children may need special supervision, it is wise to have extra helpers during the craft period.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A great variety of craft materials and projects are being produced by commercial companies. However, you can also prepare excellent crafts from inexpensive materials or- from scraps of paper, plastic, glass, cloth, and metal. The church library or your own personal library should contain several craft books which present hundreds of creative ideas for crafts.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Use projects that are related to one lesson, or to a lesson series. Your class will learn more by constructing a model of the tabernacle than by just observing it or reading the description in Exodus. Making a relief map of Palestine will teach more about the locations of cities, mountains, and valleys than by pointing them out on a map or reading about them, or even by special instruction in Bible geography.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students may also be involved in making crafts that are to be given to others or used by others. Such projects have the added value of arousing within the student a serious concern for others.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Most people have sat through class sessions that dealt with an interesting topic, yet the lesson was not as effective as it should have been because the teacher did not present the lesson in an organized manner. Some teachers may argue that they are just not organized persons, and thus they cannot present the lesson in an organized way. But by following a few simple guidelines for lesson organization, any teacher can present a lesson with greater impact. It will take some time and practice, but it is well worth the effort.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Good planning will allow you to make better use of your skills and natural talents. It will also enable you to make better use of the limited class time. Lesson material needs organization.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Usually it is wise to stick to the lesson plan you have prepared in advance. Yet occasionally a class situation will arise that will justify departing from it.

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Logical</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;This consists of sorting and selecting relevant material. Different parts are arranged together logically-proceeding from the known to the unknown. This produces logical thinking and helps clarify truths to be learned.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Chronological</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Large portions of the Bible can best be grasped and retained when presented in their historical relationship. God&#39;s revelation to man was chronological. In each age He revealed more of His divine purpose to chosen writers who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit (II Peter 1:21). The chronological pattern is especially appropriate when dealing with narratives. Chronological organization is related to the preparation of each lesson and to the entire curriculum of Bible study.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Psychological</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;This method consists of planning the subject matter to fit the comprehension and experience of the students. There is little purpose in teaching truth, however significant and profound, which is beyond the comprehension of the students. Material must be adapted to the understanding or it is either never received or soon forgotten. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 399.6pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Both secular and Christian educators stress the psychological organization of materials. This method, however, must not take precedence over Bible content. There must be a balanced emphasis on both the application and the acquisition of God&#39;s Word. As you teach the facts of the Bible, constantly be aware of the students&#39; needs and their level of understanding. Also realize that at times a student will be more emotionally receptive to the truth than at other times.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The young child requires materials and methods that differ from those required by the high school student. The junior has different needs than the adult. In each case the Bible is the source for the material, but the adaptation of the material is geared to the age group and its developmental needs.</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A well-organized lesson is the result of several important steps. These begin with objective consideration of what should be emphasized and lead to the application of these emphases in the students&#39; lives.</span></p><p class="cs3A72D1BC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Determine Emphasis</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Lesson emphases are based on a clear concept of the central truth in the Bible passage or passages presented in the lesson and the meaning of the passage in the lives of class members. Every lesson contains much more than can be taught during the allotted period. You must identify and concentrate, therefore, on the central truth of the Scripture passage. A thorough study of the passage, the lesson title, the memory selection, and the outline of the lesson will help determine the major emphasis.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 52.55pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">All preparation will center on the aims of the lesson. Curriculum materials should be examined in the light of &#39;these purposes. Ask yourself: &quot;What can I find here to meet the needs of my class members?&quot; The teacher&#39;s guide will probably suggest general aims for the series and specific aims for individual lessons. You, however, are not limited to these aims. Since the aims in the guide are likely to be rather general, adapt the lesson aims to the needs of your class.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Select Methods and Materials</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;To allow for preparation these should be selected well in advance of class presentation. Many factors are involved in determining the methods to be used. These include the students&#39; age and the lesson content. Vary your methods for more effective presentation.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Keep in mind that more content is needed for a lecture than for a discussion. On the other hand, more time is required if methods involve student participation. The character of the lesson will also determine its treatment. Some lessons may require the extensive use of visuals. Other lessons involving controversial material may be best handled by the use of discussions, debates or buzz groups. In others, drama, role-playing, or a field trip may be most effective.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">After deciding the aims and methods, study all the available materials. Not all lesson materials can be used. Select those which will help in the realization of lesson aims. Reports; assignments, questions, Bible memory work, pictures, and other collateral material require lesson time. Using visuals, especially projected visuals, necessitates special preparation. All these materials contribute, however, to well-rounded lesson development.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Relate to Life</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Little is gained from teaching that is not related to life. A well-organized lesson often incorporates questions, illustrations, and planned application which direct the students&#39; thoughts to the meaning of the lesson in their personal lives.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Questions</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Truths should be brought into prominence so that the students will recognize the train of thought, and feel that they are making progress as the lesson proceeds. You can inspire good participation by thoughtful questions. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Illustrations</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Appropriate illustrations must be selected beforehand and included in the outline. Sometimes you might introduce the lesson with an illustration. This approach gains attention and sets the stage for the presentation. The opening illustration may be woven into the entire teaching period and then repeated or referred to at the conclusion for response. It is a rewarding experience to anticipate points that will need clarification and then to illustrate them from everyday experience such as nature, history, stories, or songs.</span></li><li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Application</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;There is a saying that the lesson really begins with the application. This underscores the importance of application, an importance that, unfortunately, is not understood by many teachers. This important phase of preparation, however, is not difficult for teachers who have assembled and organized their material to meet the students&#39; needs. Ask yourself this pertinent question: &quot;How can I get my class to express in daily living the truths that I am preparing to teach?&quot; The Holy Spirit will enable you to follow the right procedure as you pray and plan for the personal application.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is not enough to urge students to study the lesson and complete projects. Even those who want to do this may be overwhelmed and discouraged by the size of .the task. You must communicate clearly, helping students know how and what to study.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Suggest definite sources of help. Without proper guidance, students will not know what books to consult. With younger students, it is advisable to give them the material and offer to help them in research.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Assignments should be personal and individual. One student may be given a question to answer; another, a topic for study and report; a third, a map to draw; a fourth, some Bible references to compare. The interest, capacity, and ability of each class member should be considered in selecting the nature of the assignment. Whenever possible, every member of the class should participate.</span></p><p class="cs50ACB997"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Class Reports</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Students are frustrated if they do out-of-class assignments and then are not given opportunity to report their findings in class. Plan for the presentation of all assignments and use various means to make these effective. </span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Formulate questions which take into account the interests of the students and encourage them to express themselves freely. Creativity should be encouraged at every opportunity. If the class has a good background of Bible knowledge or is making an intensive or extensive study of the lesson, individual student_ may use their assigned topics to introduce general discussion. Class members will usually participate in any discussion they introduce. Failure to secure initial involvement may hinder full cooperation. Under your skillful leadership, even the timid and the slow learner can be drawn into class activities.</span></p><p class="csA5964A5E"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

This experience for the student teacher should be carefully supervised, so that each class member will have a genuine learning experience. Brief the student teacher before the class session. During a post-session evaluation encourage the student teacher to peruse training courses to prepare for future teaching.</span></li></ol>

This, however, does not eliminate the need for a practical knowledge and studying of good teaching techniques. Spirituality and correct methodology are not mutually exclusive. Unless there has been careful, prayerful, Spirit-guided preparation, teaching is likely to be fruitless.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Training also is essential. Pursuing a training course does not guarantee that teachers are qualified, but training does help establish the basic knowledge, attitudes, and skills of teaching.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">For well-trained, carefully prepared teachers, each lesson is a welcome opportunity for Christian service.

			<span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers who have given adequate time, prayer and thought to plan their lesson are now ready to work their plan. The campaign for attention and interest begins before the first student arrives. Be in the classroom early (15 minutes before class begins) so that you can greet the students as they arrive. Being habitually late is, by your actions, suggesting that the class or the students aren&rsquo;t important.

The first concern is to establish right attitudes and interest among the class members.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Contact with the Class&mdash;Students are motivated in various ways to come to class. Some come because they are brought by parents. Others come out of habit. Many come because they enjoy the fellowship of friends. Probably very few come because they have a sincere desire to study the Word of God.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">How do you deal with these attitudes that may range from indifference to outright antagonism? First, establish a point of contact. Convince the students that you have something to offer that interests them and meets some of their needs. Next, arouse interest in learning. Finally, focus their attention on the lesson. No introduction, regardless of how interesting it may be, is a success if it does not open the door to the lesson.

Whenever information is imparted the class should be expected to think it through with you. </span><span class="cs91EF8B52">1) </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">One method of guiding thought is the pattern of deductive thinking. The teacher begins with a principle or general statement. &nbsp;</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">2) </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">This is followed by a number of illustrations then students are involved in seeking further examples from their own lives. The deductive method is like a cone.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Encourage Expression</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">:--When students have the opportunity to express</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">lesson principles in their own words, they are more likely to remember them. Through the use of the inductive method of teaching. Use this approach, begin with a situation or problem or perhaps a series of problems to enlist the help of the students in gathering facts or illustrations. This information is then evaluated in the light of the scriptures, and the class arrives at laws, or general principles, shown by the point on the cone.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers should lead .their classes to face specific situations in which they need to practice the Christian ideal. With constant emphasis on the application as well as the acquisition of knowledge, especially in the early years, students will learn and will make application of the lesson to their choice of conduct, course of action, attitudes, and overall spiritual life.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Because there is mental activity as well as physical, at times self-expression may take the form of self-restraint. Refusing to say or do what is wrong is still self-expression. Character is made up not only of impulses but also of restraints.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You need to understand that even mature Christians will not always agree upon the most appropriate way to apply Bible principles to real life situations. So these disagreements sometimes arise in class discussions. Such disagreements can be the basis for spiritual growth when they are conducted in an atmosphere of love and f forbearance.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:right 445.65pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The lesson should not end abruptly, and careful consideration should be given to a good conclusion. You should plan for three to five minutes of unhurried and prayerful application.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Summarize the Lesson</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;One effective way to conclude a lesson is to summarize it. Questions or class discussions may break into the planned outline, but take time to sum up the results of the class period emphasizing the fundamental facts of the lesson. What are the important truths? What practical lessons have been taught? What final response should be made? .How has Christ been revealed as the Savior? How can the lesson be demonstrated and applied at home, at school, at work?</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Use Illustrations</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Some teachers have a flair for using dramatic illustrations. They may close a lesson with an appropriate illustration that touches the emotions of the students. This type of conclusion is usually most effective when the main lesson aim is to produce a change in attitude.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Anticipate Future Interests</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The closing minutes of the lesson period provide a good time to prepare students for the truths that will follow in successive lessons. They can experience a panoramic view of the days and weeks ahead which will stimulate eagerness by whetting their learning appetites.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Before the class is dismissed, refer to the next lesson and present plans for each student&#39;s participation in it. This is a good way to arouse interest and make assignments.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Arouse Interest</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Teachers want their classes to come back enthusiastically. By some startling statement or striking question, curiosity and interest can be aroused. Authors usually conclude a chapter so that the reader can hardly wait for the next chapter of a serial story. In the same manner, finish the day&#39;s portion of &quot;the most interesting story in the world,&quot; with such a climactic ending that the entire class will look forward to the next session.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Make Assignments</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Assignments must be carefully planned ahead of time, but the animated way in which they are assigned will determine the interest and enthusiasm of class members. These assignments should not be limited to academic activities such as reading the student text or quarterly or completing the workbook. They should include activities that involve applying the lesson to life situations. Most students find these more interesting than reading or writing assignments.</span></li></ol>

You can increase your effectiveness by carefully following planned procedures.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Utilize the initial class time to capture interest and attention. This begins when the first student arrives. During the introduction of the lesson, it is 4elpful to establish contact with the class in order to relate the lesson to their thinking.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You will present your lesson according to the plan you have developed. In doing this you stimulate students to think, to express their thoughts, and to apply the lesson to their own lives. Both the inductive and deductive teaching approaches are fruitful procedures.</span></p><h1 class="csC1DF526">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">God is the author of law and order; satan is the author of confusion and chaos. The words </span><span class="csC382D2BB">disciple</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> and </span><span class="csC382D2BB">discipline</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> come from a word that means </span><span class="csC382D2BB">trained in orderliness</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">. (I Cor.14:40)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible also teaches that children are to be brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord (Ephesians 6:4). Nurture is instruction; admonition is discipline. Teachers and leaders must not only instruct, but also exercise discipline. Disorder interferes with learning. Disorderly students interfere with the teacher&rsquo;s efforts. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students who are well behaved and obedient in other places may be disorderly in class. Why? Perhaps teachers do not know how to express orderliness. If they will speak with the authority of God&rsquo;s word, its teaching will bring effective results.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs1F553829"><a name="_Toc242823176"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">Setting the Pattern:</span></a></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">	</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Importance of a Pattern</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Order is contagious. So is disorder. One unruly student affects another; each distraction leads to another. Leaders or teachers with poorly prepared programs invite trouble. An orderly atmosphere will command attention and respect. If chairs are properly arranged with materials in their places, the students will likely leave them that way. Teachers and leaders should set a good example. To stimulate good behavior, check the classroom equipment and procedures.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs468D3CFB"><span class="cs31B015EA">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="7" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Proper Equipment</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Check well in advance of the class period to be sure that needed supplies and equipment are ready to be used.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs19BAD075" style="tab-stops:left 36pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="8" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Comfortable Surroundings</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Classes should meet under favorable physical conditions. Students will not sit quietly if they are uncomfortable in chairs that are too large or too small. Poor ventilation and extremes of temperature also contribute to discipline problems. Christian education classrooms should be as comfortable as regular school classrooms. Lighting ought to be suitable, neither too bright nor too dim.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs7DB55037"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="9" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Few Distractions&mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71"> Within the teaching situation, several things can be done to avoid distractions. Noises and activities may distract students, but drapes and insulation can often reduce outside noises. Divide large groups to separate disruptive students. Use curtains and temporary partitions to divide large teaching areas containing several classes.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some administrative leaders interrupt the lesson to distribute offering envelopes or literature or make announcements which may upset the teacher, the class, and the lesson. Advance planning will usually find ways to take care of these matters. Superintendents should protect their teachers from these distractions so that they might have sufficient time and privacy for the lesson.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="10" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">EXAMPLE OF THE TEACHER</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;The student&#39;s conduct will be affected by your example. Give special attention to your own physical, mental, and spiritual life.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 23.5pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span></p><ol start="11" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SELF-CONTROL</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Most teachers hope that God will transform their class members into quiet, attentive students, but few teachers pray for their own self-control. Spirit-controlled teachers are victorious. Even the most extenuating circumstances should not cause you to lose control of yourself. Teachers who do not control themselves are not likely to control others. Many things may try your patience, and you need to be on guard lest you become irritated and impatient.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Students quickly discover if you are in a state of confusion and they will disregard your leadership. To be effective, experience the &quot;fruit of the Spirit&quot; and demonstrate the grace that makes pleasant and cordial relationships between you and your students possible. The calm, quiet, forceful mastery of Christ impressed his listeners and made them listen to his words. In every controversy he was master of the situation.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="12" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs3485825C"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SELF-IMAGE</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Students quickly perceive the teacher&#39;s self-image. You need to undertake some honest self-exploration. Discipline problems may be related to your own emotional stresses such as fatigue, a quarrel at home, or job insecurity.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Sometimes lack of confidence comes from inexperience. Students will occasionally take advantage of inexperienced teachers. This in turn causes teachers to become discouraged and feel that they are not cut out to be teachers. Beginning teachers can take some consolation in the fact that probably every teacher has gone through this experience at some time. If you become frustrated or feel inadequate because of any of these factors, do not hesitate to counsel with your superintendent or fellow teachers. They will be sympathetic and can offer many helpful suggestions.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="13" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">PREPARATION</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Teachers must be masters of their subjects if they are to influence their students. The lesson itself should keep order. Poorly prepared teachers will have trouble. Orderliness in instruction leads to orderliness in conduct. Disorder leads to inattention and a lack of interest.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You should not feel totally responsible or guilty because you are not always able to maintain perfect order in the classroom. Disorders may be caused by external conditions or by students&#39; personal problems that have nothing to do with you or the quality of your teaching. Some disorderly students may be thoughtless, restless, or unknowingly self-centered.</span></p><h3 class="cs6FE56D2">
			<span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></h3>
		<ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">THOUGHTLESSNESS</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Learn how to distinguish between students who are merely thoughtless and those with problems that are more deeply rooted. For example, some students act irreverently because they have never been taught how to be reverent. This is sometimes a greater problem when students come from unchurched backgrounds. But even students, who have been taught reverence for sacred things, find it difficult at times to carry out their best intentions.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 18.95pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Many churches provide systematic training in the early years of a child&#39;s life. They believe that reverence </span><span class="csC382D2BB">for </span><span class="csCF6BBF71">sacred things can become a part of life. If proper conduct patterns are formed early, students will be more likely to follow them later on.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">RESTLESSNESS</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Nervous tensions, frustrations, and hyperactivity are on the increase. It is not uncommon for you to have students in your class with serious emotional disorders. Some of these problems may be physical in origin; others may arise from unstable home conditions. Unless you are a trained psychologist you cannot be expected to deal with serious emotional problems. Yet you must try to help these students.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs4D363080"><span class="csCF6BBF71">If you teach children, recognize that they will be active. God made them so that they want to shout, run, and jump, not sit quietly for long periods of time and listen. Since they delight in activity, they will supply their own if you do not keep them involved. These alert, energetic students need a full program of activities that will allow them opportunities to participate in the lesson. Since variety will help hold their attention, plan several different types of activities, changing from one to another when student interest begins to wane.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SELF &ndash;CENTEREDNESS&mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">From the minute they are born, individuals are self-centered. Only through teaching and experience do they learn to be generous and to share. When they come to class, many young children have had little experience playing and sharing with others. They need extra love and attention to help them work with the group.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Some people feel rejected and unwanted. In an attempt to gain attention, they sometimes are disruptive. Openly reprimanding the students can sometimes make the situation worse, because, in a. negative way, a scolding gives them the attention they want. &nbsp;Instead, try to give such students tasks or assignments that will meet their emotional needs and at the same time make a positive contribution to the class.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Learn to use disruptive behavior in creative ways. Here is what one preschool teacher did when an energetic student blew a whistle in class. The teacher said, &quot;Johnny has a whistle. A whistle is a good thing. What is a whistle good for?&quot; Several replied. Then the application was skillfully made. The warnings and admonitions of the Bible were referred to as God&#39;s manner of attracting attention.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Bible says, &quot;Blow the trumpet in Zion&quot; a whistle blown for God&#39;s people. The theme was developed helpfully. In the course of the diversion the teacher asked for the whistle, took it in her hand, commented on its construction, and assured Johnny she would return it after class.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71"> </span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Good discipline does pot just happen. It results from specific preparation on your part. The following suggestions will help reduce discipline problems.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 32.15pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csB9F5EC11"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Understand the Purpose of Discipline</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Quiet, controlled students and undisturbed classes are not necessarily the ideal toward which discipline should lead, Discipline looks beyond immediate emergency situations. There will always be those occasions where your immediate action will be necessary. However, external control is only temporarily effective. Young students need help in the maturation process to develop satisfactory images of them so they will grow in inner control as well.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Lay a Foundation for Discipline</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Discipline begins with the general atmosphere which you establish. Loving the students, exhibiting a spirit of warmth, meeting their needs in teaching and developing personal strength through faith in God will set the stage for increasing discipline.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Early in the classroom experience students should become aware of the type of behavior which is expected. Guiding class members to see and accept the right behavior is the secret of good discipline.</span></p><p class="csFC6B70DB"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs3485825C"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Deal with the Source of the Problem</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;There is a tendency to label some students as mischievous, rebellious, or malicious, when they do not measure up to standards of behavior. It is important to remember that students are by nature active and lacking in self-control. Many things they do may be normal behavior at their age.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Often students&#39; behavior is a signal that there are deeper, underlying problems. When students bully others, show off, or are destructive, they may be saying, &quot;Help me with my problems.&quot; Serious mistakes can be made when you fail to uncover the real problem.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Establish Positive Relationships</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Many discipline problems can be resolved through a deep concern for the welfare of students and a relationship of love and acceptance.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Authority or superior physical strength may curb unwanted actions but only temporarily. Another method is to repeatedly lecture disruptive students about what they should or should not do. But these lectures often fall on deaf ears. The long-term result of negative action may be more rebellion. Positive relationships are needed. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A better way is to exhibit genuine respect for students as individuals in their own right and evidence a deep desire to help them</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Clarify Rules of Behavior</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Students can participate in establishing acceptable patterns of behavior in the classroom. Often they will be more stringent in their demands than you might be. Students also can be called upon to assist in enforcing behavior.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">You are responsible to help all class members know what is expected. Students should know when they may talk or walk around, that destruction of property is not allowed, and that all persons have equal rights and opportunities. Unfamiliar and vague rules contribute little to good discipline. It is also important to enforce the rules fairly, without playing favorites.</span></p><ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Work in Cooperation with the Home</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Teachers and parents share responsibility in helping children become disciplined individuals. Usually, a discussion with parents concerning unruly children will be helpful, both for parents and teachers. Sometimes causes of problems can be discovered by visiting children in their homes. Discussions with parents should be private so that children do not feel the adults are joining forces against them. </span></li></ol>

Your aim is to help every person mature toward Christ-likeness. This includes the development of self-discipline and inner-directed behavior in keeping with Christian goals and values.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Various sources of discipline problems can be eliminated by giving attention to equipment, surroundings, and distractions. But essentially, good discipline begins with you. Your self-control, instruction, and self-image will be perceived by the students who will respond in keeping within established patterns.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Teachers need to understand that discipline is more than enforced good behavior. It is the effort to help students develop inner control. Knowledge of the student both personally and generally, will help to identify the source of problems. You should recognize normal behavior and also behavior which stems from deep, underlying problems.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Warm, accepting relationships with the class members will go far toward solving behavior problems. In addition, recognize that you are not working alone, but rather with parents who share your concern for the growth of the children and with the Lord who is interested in the best for all students.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="csF8CBA3A1">

Education includes both acquiring knowledge and its use. For this reason, teachers should not be satisfied with their teaching unless students not only learn Bible truths but begin to apply them to their lives. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

When Godliness is manifested, they know that the word of God has been effective and the lessons have been learned It is impossible to separate Christian character from Christian living. Christian character is developed by living and expressed through living. The outward Christian life is the result of the Christ-formed character within. When Christ is acknowledged as Lord the learner will be mastered by God&rsquo;s Truth and will establish habits of study, prayer, reverence, worship obedience and unselfishness. An urgent desire to cultivate these habits should motivate Christian teachers.</span></li></ol>

The habit of doing nothing is as devastating as the habit of doing wrong. In cooperating expressional encourage activities in the teaching program will encourage positive, active Christian character. Christ&rsquo;s teaching method included a strong emphasis on application People develop Christian behavior patterns in the same way. They learn to pray not by defining or describing prayer, but by prayer. They learn to study God&rsquo;s word by actual use of the Bible. They become reverent obedient and unselfish by practicing these virtues.</span></li></ol>

The Bible is changeless in every changing age. (II Timothy 3:16) The human heart is deceitful above all things. (Jeremiah 17:9) Students cannot build Christian faith on the foundation of every day human experience. The Bible is the chart and compass. The Bible deals with life by recognizing sin and supplying God&rsquo;s remedy. Bible-centered lessons aimed at Life-centered needs provide the most effective curricula. Our Lord laid great stress on application based on the word of God. (Isaiah 6; Luke 4:16-21) His exposition provided an up-to-date application. He said the words of the prophet were fulfilled that very day. Years later, after his resurrection on the road to Emmaus, he drew from them the reason for their real. We met their comforted life situation and comforted the sorrowful disciples by &ldquo;expounding unto them in all the Scripture the things concerning him.&rdquo;(Luke 4:16-21). This was his method of Bible teaching. It was applied instruction. It was aimed at human need.</span></li></ol>

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Spirit of God applies truths of the word to student&rsquo;s lives.

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Actions</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Teachers cannot successfully relate truth until they have applied it to their own lives.

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Attitudes</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Truth is shared through relationship as well as transmitted by words. A recent study demonstrates that the attitude of junior high students toward God is not dependent on the amount of their Bible knowledge. Their attitudes are dependent on those expressed by their parents. Teachers also transmit their attitudes to students. Many young people have testified that while they forgot the verbal instruction received in their youth, they could never forget the exemplary lives of Godly teachers. The lesson must affect you before it can bless the class.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Spirituality</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;After conversion, the student should be given opportunities to grow spiritually. Regular attendance at church, Growth in grace, worship and Christian fellowship will aid in this. The aim of spirituality is the mature person in Christ (Ephesians 4:13). As the reality of Christ increases by faith, the fruit of the spirit will also become more evident (Galatians 5:22,23)</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Relate to Life</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Until early adolescence, students have a limited power of generalization. They do not readily see the underlying principles of Biblical teachings which apply to many different situations. You cannot force change upon those you teach. Students must be confronted with the Word and see its relationship to their own needs, before they are ready to make a personal response.</span></li></ol>

Sometimes the entire class can agree to select a certain behavior pattern, an attitude, or an activity which reflects the emphasis of the lesson. They may agree to follow this behavior pattern or set of values during the coming week. This can be followed by an evaluation of results in the view of the lesson the following week.</span></li></ol>

Each generation needs training to be liberal, systematic, cheerful givers. Students need information about the object of their gift as well as why they give. This will encourage them to practice Christian stewardship.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">Service</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;An adequate curriculum, properly taught should lead students to a personal responsibility for their talents. Christians need to live for Christ in their own home. Children as well as adults should realize their responsibility for happiness at home. They should be encouraged to participate in the care of home. All students also should be impressed with their responsibility to the church. This implies regular attendance, systematic contributions and active participation in its programs. Students should be encouraged to invite new people and visit those whose attendance is irregular or dropped out entirely. Service should also extend to other lands and missionaries. Students must be brought to see their responsibility for evangelizing the entire world. (Mathew 28:19,20)</span></li></ol>

Most teachers are surprised to discover how little knowledge is actually retained by their students. Hence, there is a vital need to evaluate teaching methods and emphases and to review lessons. Sooner or later every teacher&#39;s effectiveness will be judged, not only by men, but also by God. (I Cor. 3:1-15)</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;Those who evaluate their students find that a major difficulty is the inadequacy of their own teaching.

This should be more than a mere repetition of exact words or phrases. Student knowledge is examined to determine whether it is clear or confused. Students should be encouraged to say in their own way what they understand to be the truth. If teachers are to obtain a true picture of student understanding, the questions asked should be thorough, searching, correct, and inspiring.</span></p><p class="cs51A9ED8"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Be alert to attitudes and knowledge as expressed. Frequently, students not understanding one word or phrase will break communication and you should immediately explain it.

Yet many persons have had unhappy experiences with them, so use discretion. Many people relate examinations to wearisome, last-minute cramming, or the painful experience of trying to put on paper what has been laboriously or hurriedly memorized. They are concerned about unanticipated questions and unanswerable problems. The result is that church teachers and students alike have avoided testing in general. Yet, if teaching is taken seriously, and is earnest, thoughtful, and skillful, various methods of testing can be used effectively. A well-designed examination challenges students to rethink what they have learned and to express their learning in a life-related context. You also may require the preparation of a paper to show research work.

Often the use of a pretest or carefully planned discussion before beginning a series of Bible lessons will reveal what should be emphasized in class and provide a basis for comparison when an examination is given.

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">BEHAVORIAL RECORDS&mdash;</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">The tests just described are used to determine the students&#39; knowledge of Bible content. Teachers also desire to measure spiritual growth and behavior. This is more difficult because life consists largely of habits of thinking, feeling, or acting that have become deeply rooted through repetition. Younger students need assistance in the formation of right habits. Church teachers and parents should cooperate in this important ministry. Jesus emphasized this phase of Christian instruction when he said, &quot;Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock&quot; (Matt. 7:24). Among several ways to measure behavior are the use of records and self-rating scales.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">RECORDS</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Successful Christian education programs are not satisfied with mere records of attendance. Several excellent systems have been developed to record additional information, including the interest and response of students. These systems tabulate such items as lesson preparation, church attendance, family background, punctuality, use of Bible, prayer life, witnessing, enlisting new students and offerings.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs19BAD075"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs7E7DBF25"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SELF-RATING SCALES</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;An important objective of Christian education is to lead students to become mature, serving Christians. Progress toward this goal does not come instantaneously, nor does it come steadily. Growth takes time and it often comes in spurts. Further, growth in every aspect of one&#39;s character does not progress at the same rate. For example, the students&#39; growth in stewardship may develop more rapidly than in the areas of witnessing. Or their devotional life may be growing richer while their relations with their families and friends show little improvement.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">To help measure spiritual growth, self-rating scales are useful tools. Two types of scales can be used. One provides self-evaluation in terms of the frequency of an action:</span><span class="cs91EF8B52"> </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csC62572D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">(3) Providing help for a person in trouble. &nbsp;</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">always</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">/</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">usually</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">/</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">sometimes</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">/</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">seldom</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">/</span><span class="cs91EF8B52">never</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 6.45pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 6.45pt;"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Another kind permits evaluation in terms of a scale and students are asked to evaluate their behavior on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the best score.	</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1" style="tab-stops:left 6.45pt;"><span class="cs31B015EA">&nbsp;</span></p><ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A class can identify a number of Christian behavior patterns based on the lesson. On this basis a simple tool can be constructed.</span></p><p class="csC7B7F1B5"><span class="cs91EF8B52">&nbsp;</span></p><ol start="4" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">EVALUATING ATTITUDES AND CHOICES</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash;Christian teaching should lead to the formation of biblical attitudes and choices. Teachers need to be concerned about evaluating for growth in these areas, but it is not easy to measure such progress. Since the Holy Spirit is involved in regeneration and spiritual growth, objective measurements are not always possible. No one can understand the Spirit&#39;s mysterious operations or know the time when conviction is brought to the heart. Teachers must be sensitive to the moods of their classes. They must know how to take advantage of the moment when the time for decision has come. The greatest joy you can experience is to be able to lead one of your students to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.</span></li></ol>

			<li class="csDFEBC933"><span class="cs91EF8B52">SUMMARY</span><span class="csCF6BBF71">&mdash; Teachers and leaders repeatedly indicate that many church education students possess only minimal Bible knowledge. Although church educational programs have avoided the use of testing programs responsible teaching includes an &#39;evaluation of results. These results are not limited to Bible knowledge, but extend to attitudes and behavior.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">A simple approach to determine student knowledge is the use of the oral participation method. Through the skillful employment of questions students are given the opportunity to share their knowledge, insights, convictions, and decisions. It also is possible for teachers to develop and utilize various forms of Bible tests. True/false, completion, multiple choice, and matching tests are most popular.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Behavioral tests are more difficult to construct. Weekly records give an indication of participation in church-related activities. Self-rating scales are useful in helping students take a careful look at their own lives in terms of principles that are based on the biblical passages they have studied.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
