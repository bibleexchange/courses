<h3>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.God&apos;s Church').'</h3>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We must understand the difference between &quot;The Church&quot; and &quot;churches.&quot; &quot;The Church&quot; is mystical&#44; invisible&#44; universal and general. It is also singular&#44; for God has only one &quot;Church.&quot; It is the same &quot;Church in the past&#44; present&#44; and future. ').'</p>

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The &quot;churches&quot; (local church) are real&#44; concrete&#44; visible&#44; local&#44; and specific. It is the universal Church as it is taking on local or temporal form. The word church&#44; in the Greek&#44; is ekklesia&#44; which means to &quot;summon forth&quot; or &quot;to call out&quot; the people. The Hebrew word qahal means &quot;assembly&quot; or &quot;congregation. (Ps. 22:22) In our study&#44; the word &quot;Ekklesia&quot; we will be considered in the context of: a local body of Believers gathered together for worship of God and fellowship. (Eph. 4:16)').'</p>
<h2>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.God&apos;s Order for this Age is the Local Church').'</h2>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Today&#44; many do not respect the local church as God&apos;s permanent order for this church age. The structure of the local church may vary with size or locality&#44; but it is still God&apos;s order for this age. The local church is divinely patterned for effective evangelizing of the world and bringing his people to maturity.').'</p>
<h3>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Islands are Rebellious').'</h3>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We must relate to a local body and not become an island to ourselves. To separate ourselves from the local body is unscriptural. We are all parts of the same body. Not one of us is to be independent of the other. It is God&apos;s plan and purpose that each member of his universal body be joined to a local body of Believers. A man&#44; or woman&#44; who refuses to join themselves to a local body of Believers often feels they are wasting their effort. This type of spirit is a rebellious and independent spirit and is contrary to Scripture. ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Within the Old Testament tabernacle&#44; there was a designated place of worship. The Believer was not to remain at home to worship. He was to gather with the local body in a designated place of worship. There is no Scriptural basis for remaining at home to worship while the local body is gathering even if you do enjoy the &quot;Electronic Evangelist&quot; more than the local elders.').'</p>
<h3>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Becoming an Island Alienates You from the Umbrella of Providence').'</h3>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Church order and leadership were clearly seen in the Old Testament. Aaron and his sons were a type of the N.T. fivefold ministry. (Eph 4:13) The watchmen on the walls of the cities of Israel are a type of the leaders of the N.T. church who are watching for our souls. It is the responsibility of the elders to guard against those with erroneous teachings who would kill and destroy the body. (Heb. 13:17) The shepherds upon the hillside of Judah and Israel were a type of God&apos;s chosen leadership for his church today. They are not only entrusted with the care and guidance of the flock but of feeding the flock of God with nourishing spiritual food. (Acts 20:28)').'</p>
<h2>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.God&apos;s Pattern for the Local Church').'</h2>
<h3>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.God Has Set His Pattern in Scripture').'</h3>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In his Word&#44; God offers a pattern for the formation of local churches. First&#44; he directed Believers to assemble together in given locations. (Heb. 10:25) Next he ordains where to establish a local church&#44; often where not to.(Acts 16:6-10) God puts into place the leadership ministries he would have in each local assembly.(Acts 14:23) Though most in the church recognizes that God designates leaders&#44; they do not give much thought about the fact that God also brings in embers. (I Cor. 12:18) We should carefully consider God&apos;s placement in the best church for them&#44; especially in this day of running to and fro by many church members.(Job 1:7) If God sets us in a particular church as members or leaders&#44; we must remain there until God moves us and not before. Never should we move because we have been offended.').'</p>
<h3>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.God&apos;s Principles for Church Government').'</h3>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There are some basic principles of church government&#44; which we must observe if we want to fully follow God&apos;s pattern.').'</p>
<h4>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Sovereignty of the Local Body').'</h4>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Nowhere in Scripture does God teach a denominational type of church government. Each local church is to be a sovereign body&#44; even though they are to enjoy fellowship with other local assemblies. ').'</p>
<h4>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Life in the Local Body').'</h4>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The church is first to be a spiritual &quot;organism&quot; and then to be an &quot;organization&quot;. Good church government will not produce spirituality. In the church of the living God&#44; there must be life before structure. ').'</p>
<h4>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Order in the Local Body').'</h4>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.After there is life&#44; good structure in the form of church government will help to maintain life. As a family requires parents&#44; and as a flock requires a shepherd&#44; so the household of faith requires spiritual leaders. We need the fivefold ministry so that we may come to maturity within the body. (Eph. 4:11-13) Leaders cannot give what they do not possess. They must meet the scriptural qualifications seen in I Timothy 3. A common error today is the belief that we do not need men to lead us&#44; that &quot;we have the Holy Spirit to lead us&#44; don&apos;t we?&quot; The Spirit leads and governs the church through human vessels. (Heb. 13:17) To bypass everyone and seek leading only from God is usually the sign of a rebellious and independent spirit. These people often use a verse of Scripture out of context&#44; such as&#44; I Jn. 2:27 to justify refusing submission to God-anointed and God-called teachers. If we choose to reject the teaching that God has ordained&#44; a strong oversight in the ministry within the Body of Christ&#44; God will permit us to find isolated Scriptures to satisfy our rebellion and independence. God appoints leaders and directs them to set the house in order. (II Thess. 2:10-12)').'</p>

<h1>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The New Testament Pattern').'</h1>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Since we are living in the last days we must completely open to the moving of the Holy Ghost&#44; who is endeavoring to restore the New Testament pattern to the Local Church. The ministry of the &quot;Word&quot; was restored when the Word of God was once again given its rightful place among the people of God after having come out of the Dark Ages or the Devils millennium. During this time the Word was withheld from the body of Christ and held only in the hands of an elite&#44; select group of so-called theologians.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In these last days the Spirit is striving to restore the ministry of the &quot;works&quot; of Jesus by empowering the Believer to do the same works that He did.').'</p>
<blockquote>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Verily&#44; verily I say unto you&#44; He that believeth on me&#44; the works that I do he shall do also: and greater works then these shall he; because I go unto my father. (John 14:12) ').'</blockquote>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.God is challenging the representatives of His Church to break away from tradition and to get into the flow of the Spirit if we ever expect to progress toward God&apos;s ideal for the Local Church. Those who refuse to move with the Holy Ghost are the ones who bring division to the Body of Christ. Jesus taught us that&#44; just as you can&apos;t put new wine into old wine skins&#44; the fullness of the Holy Ghost cannot enter old contaminated lives (Matthew 9:16-17). Even the Church has crawled into the ditch of &quot;this is the way we have always done it.&quot; It is time to break from these traditions under the leadership of the Holy Ghost.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.It is often those who want to flow with the Spirit who are forced to out of their nests - out of their accustomed place of worship and body of worshipers. When this happens you may mistakenly feel it is man who has forced you out. In reality&#44; it is God leading you to higher heights and deeper depths in Him. Even though it is God&apos;s hand leading you&#44; a time of shock and disorientation will inevitably follow this upheaval. ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.It is important that we recognize our life and ministry after a spiritual shake-up. The old rubble must be removed if we are to ever to rebuild according to the pattern the Lord has shown us. We must also remember that&#44; as in Nehemiah&apos;s day&#44; God is able to take some of the old charred stones from the rubble&#44; clean them up and use them in the rebuilding process. It would be a mistake to write off each and every one who seemed to be resisting the purpose of God&apos;s pattern since they may be the very ones that God will restore and use in His rebuilding process.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We must strive in every respect to see that the New Testament patter is restored to the Local Church. This can only occur with a combination of the intensive study of all Scriptures and the anointing of the Holy Ghost. We should never settle for second best. Copies are never as good as the originals they attempt to mimic. Rehoboam discovered the inadequacy of copies when he built shields of &quot;brass&quot; to replace the shields of &quot;Gold&quot; which his father&#44; Solomon&#44; had made.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We must always reach for the &quot;IDEAL&quot; which God has revealed by his spirit and in His Word. Sadly&#44; we are living in a day when people are ready to believe and accept anything that has any semblance whatsoever to God. Scripture exhorts us to go on unto perfection and we must strive for the ideal in our life and work for the Lord.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We must that which has been revealed thus far and work with the Spirit to build upon it. To do this we must be flexible without compromising. It is possible to blend and maintain an uncompromising Spirit at the same time. Many have become so pliable that they played into satan&apos;s hand and have shipwrecked their faith as well as that of those who follow. Others become so ridged in their old ways that they have become stagnant in their experience and work for the Lord. I am in no advocating leaving the old paths of holiness for the new so-called social gospel. In reality&#44; the social gospel is no gospel at all. Remember&#44; I stressed the importance of flexibility while remaining uncompromising.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Sadly&#44; many have lost sight of God&apos;s plan and purpose for the Local Church. All too often a great move of God&apos;s Spirit is followed by the organization of a new denomination or&#44; at least&#44; a body of churches formed under one central headquarters. These organizations are formed in an effort to maintain doctrinal truth and purity within the church. However&#44; as we shall see further in our study&#44; the organization has done just the opposite of what it was intended to do.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.As we study God&apos;s pattern for the Local Church&#44; we must properly interpret Scriptures or&#44; as Paul said&#44; &quot;rightly dividing the Word of Truth&#44;&quot; (2Timothy 2:15b). At this time&#44; I would like to mention a few major principles for interpreting the Scriptures:').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Scriptures must be interpreted as follows:').'</p><ul>
<li>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Literally').'</li>
<li>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Morally').'</li>
<li>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Prophetically').'</li></ul>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.First&#44; I will discuss the &quot;literal&quot; or &quot;historical&quot; method of interpreting the Scriptures. It is very helpful to have a working knowledge of the history&#44; geography&#44; culture&#44; and language of the Bible. Often&#44; the &quot;literal&quot; is the key to the &quot;spiritual&quot;. In our day too many people have such inner conviction that the Holy Ghost will teach them that they ignore the necessity of an in-depth study on their own with teachers who are under the anointing of the Holy Ghost. As dry and unspiritual as a meticulous study of the &quot;natural&quot; aspects of the Bible may seem at times&#44; we must always remember that as we dig into the &quot;natural&quot; we will find the Spiritual.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Secondly&#44; as we strive to interpret Scripture&#44; we must consider the &quot;principle&quot; or &quot;moral&quot; teaching found in every text under study. We can only do this by thinking about that which may be applied to any and every age or period of time. This type of study will consist more of application than interpretation. In order to discover the moral teaching of many Scriptures&#44; it is necessary to know the meaning of names and places first. Then&#44; as you see the Old Testament story unfold before you&#44; you will begin to see the many principles which apply to our day. ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The last principle of interpretation that I will consider is the &quot;prophetic&quot; or &quot;ultimate&quot; means of interpreting Scriptures. When we study the Bible in this manner&#44; we must remember that the overall plan of God points to the Church. ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The prophetical interpretation of Scripture always requires an ample amount of proof texts for each point or doctrine we wish to emphasize.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Jesus himself taught us that he veils truth from those whose ears are dull and whose hearts are closed (Matthew 13:10-17). To really understand the Word of God&#44; it must be in our hearts and not just in our heads. It is necessary for us to have a proper Spiritual experience to properly interpret the Word of God. Because God wants his children to serve and obey him of their own free will&#44; he has left enough loopholes in Scripture for those who desire to continue in their own willful ways&#44; to do so. As ironic as it seems&#44; he will permit them&#44; by taking a Scripture out of context or by reading into it what they desire to see&#44; to find Scripture to convince themselves of the eras they wish to embrace (2Thessalonians 2:10-11). ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.It is absolutely necessary that those who genuinely desire to walk in all of God&apos;s truth remain spiritually sensitive less they also be deceived. It is especially confusing when we see ones who reject certain revealed truth moving in the ministries in gifts of the spirit&#44; or seemingly doing so. It is important to note that is as important as the gifts of the spirit are they are indicative of spiritual maturity. Spiritually maturity is evidenced by a life abounding in the fruits of the spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) and a life persisting in obedience to all the revealed will of God. ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Some key questions to ask ourselves as we study the Scriptures are:').'</p><ul>
<li>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.How does this relate to the Jew and the people of that day in their natural circumstances?').'</li>
<li>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.What application do these Scriptures have for the Church in end time events?').'</li>
<li>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.How may these apply to the individual Christian?').'</li></ul>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The Obvious sense of a passage of Scripture is not to be ignored. Do not try to read some deep spiritual truth into a Scripture portion by excluding the obvious. Don&apos;t forget&#44; that which was natural came first and then that which is spiritual. Adam â€“ Christ.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.footnotes').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.As an example&#44; closely study the allegory found in Galatians 4:21-31').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.For example&#44; the holiness doctrine is often considered legalism by those who don&apos;t desire to live under its teachings. Those who believe this have gathered enough fragments of Scripture to convince themselves that holiness is not necessary to see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14) or that the holiness God is speaking of only pertains to the inward experience. They completely ignore such Scriptures as Romans 12:1&#44; 2 and 2Corinthians 7:1. </footnotes>').'	</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->."The key is always near the door&#44; a difficult passage may be explained by another passage which is very clear. Even the Old Testament is understood by the New Testament. Every Doctrinal truth has its headquarters passage. At the same time&#44; all Scripture pertaining to that doctrine must fit into the doctrine itself.	 Do not come to a dogmatic conclusion about any given doctrinal truth until all Scriptures pertaining to that doctrine can fit into your conclusions. "').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Do not think that God has chosen to conceal his divine truth. He definitely desires to reveal His spiritual realities to us. He does this progressively&#44; piece by piece&#44; as we have already seen in Isaiah 28:9-13. He begins this revelation by the &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;shadows&quot; which are seen in the Old Testament&#44; then leads us on to the &quot;spiritual truths&quot; or &quot;realities&quot;&#44; which are seen in the New Testament. Revelation leads progressively to the cross&#44; to the &quot;ONE NEW MAN&quot;. He is endeavoring to bring us into the fullness of the stature of Christ. <footnote> pertains to the inward experience. They completely ignore such Scriptures as Romans 12:1&#44; 2 and 2Corinthians 7:1.</footnote>').'	</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The truths that the &quot;shadow&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; portray are permanent but the natural objects themselves are not. We must see the meaning behind many of the natural terms used in the Old Testament to rightly discern the spiritual truths portrayed (i.e. Jew&#44; Israel&#44; covenant&#44; circumcision&#44; Zion&#44; etc.). These terms are used to point to the progressive work of God. Always keep in the foreground of your mind&apos;s eye that God does not retrogress. God restores without retrogressing. He is using Old Testament words with a new center of focus. That center is the cross of Christ. We need the eyes of our hearts enlightened (Ephesians 1:18).').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.As we look at the natural&#44; we may consider the nation of Israel. She must blend in with the Church. Her restoration today could well be a type of God&apos;s work in restoring the New Testament pattern to the Church in these last days. God is pointing us to the spiritual while we observe the natural dealings of God with humanity. Those who emphasize the natural dealings or works of God&#44; have very little capacity for the spiritual truths that those natural things are striving to convey.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In this Chapter we&apos;ve gone from the &quot;shadow&quot; to the &quot;substance&quot;&#44; from the &quot;natural&quot;&#44; to the &quot;spiritual&quot;&#44; and this is no time to retrogress to the natural or the shadow. Let us go on unto perfection&#44; to completion in Him. The Church is&#44; and will continue to be&#44; throughout this age&#44; God&apos;s means of revealing His will and purpose for humanity.').'</p>

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Every New Testament church was an independent church. They were &quot;self-governing&quot;&#44; &quot;self-supporting&quot;&#44; and &quot;self-propagating&quot;. Each was completely free of all ecclesiastical authority outside of it&apos;s own local membership.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Organized groups of churches with a central headquarters did not come until much later. This latter structure was intended for the purpose of maintaining moral purity and doctrinal truth. Although it was a noble aim within itself&#44; it was not seen or taught in the context of the New Testament pattern. In fact&#44; this type of church government tends to constitute unscriptural authority for the local church.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The New Testament pattern for the authority of the local assembly is solely &quot;self-governing&quot;. There is no pattern of denominational ecclesiastical leadership seen within the context of the New Testament. The leadership of each new Testament church rested within it with them at times looking also to those who founded the work.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Independent churches should not be &quot;lawless&quot; or &quot;divisive&quot;. It is of utmost importance that all churches have fellowship and unity with other local bodies of believers. Otherwise we could very easily become stagnant and self-centered in our worship and efforts for the Lord. Although inter-congregational fellowship is necessary&#44; the concept of denominational control for the sake of purity has not proven to be effective. Nearly all-historic denominations have turned to liberalism&#44; modernism&#44; apostasy&#44; and lack spiritual power. This is not only true of the old line denominations but also of many of the more recently formed ones&#44; those formed within the last eighty years or so. These facts show us that the denominational concept has failed to do exactly what it was meant to maintain.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.I must confess that some&#44; if not many&#44; &quot;Independents&quot; have also been deficient in these areas. The very fact that they are independent&#44; however&#44; has confined their lack of purity and doctrinal error to a given body or&#44; at worst&#44; to a given locality. The denominational concept allows the error to spread rapidly throughout a particular denomination. The rapid spread of denominational groups within the Pentecostal ranks have accepted divorced and remarried brethren into the ranks of the ministry. This is not only true of doctrinal error such as this but is also seen in the liberal life style among many of the denominational ranks.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There are several &quot;safe-guards&quot; of authority remaining within the local assembly. It retards the misuse of authority by politically ambitious men. In the denominational structure there is ample room for politics to become involved as there comes the need for sectional&#44; district&#44; and national leaders. Thus&#44; men strive for these positions outside of the local assembly. It also hinders false doctrine from spreading beyond the local church. Finally&#44; it keeps groups of churches from forming into denominations.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Error and heresy generally come because of lack of spirituality and sound doctrine--not as a result of the wrong kind of church government. Those found in these errors are usually divisive and lawless or completely spiritually dead. It is very easy to become spiritually dead when the proper mixture of the study of the Word and the anointing of the Holy Ghost is not present in an individual&apos;s life. This leaves us open for error. A spiritual person is one who&#44; as he delves into the Word&#44; seeks the anointing to illuminate the Word to his heart and mind. The spiritually dead are those who&#44; though they may as readily study the Word&#44; they look at it from a carnal&#44; natural outlook and in turn&#44; often become very heady and high minded.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.It is difficult to establish what New Testament church government was like since the lack of Scriptural information on the subject makes it so that we cannot accumulate a complete blueprint of the construction of the church. However&#44; enough is given in Scripture for us to build a firm foundation of proper New Testament church government. We will find that ALL MAJOR ORDER was given and ALL MAJOR QUESTIONS were answered within the Holy Scriptures. We must accept the New Testament pattern as valid for us today.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.As an example we will begin by looking at the church in Jerusalem and glean what we may from her. Though the Apostles and original leaders of the early church located their ministries&#44; for a time&#44; in and from Jerusalem&#44; it was by no means a legislative body for all the local churches then established. By reading the book of Acts very carefully we can find the there are no Scriptures that contradict this view. We will look further into the reality of Acts 15 in Chapter 7 of this book.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The first twelve chapters of the book of Acts deal primarily with the churches at Jerusalem&#44; Samaria&#44; Caesarea&#44; and Antioch. The first church to be set in order was&#44; naturally&#44; the church at Jerusalem&#44; since the first converts worshipped there. This can be seen in a review of Acts 1-7. It was in this church that the first Deacons were chosen so that the Elders (Apostles) could be released from their temporal duties to be able to give them fully to the spiritual work. We also see in this church the development of the fivefold ministry as seen in Ephesians 4:11&#44;').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->."&quot;And he gave some&#44; apostles; and some&#44; prophets; and some&#44; evangelists; and 	some&#44; pastors and teachers;&quot;"').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The second local church&#44; documented in Acts 8&#44; was established in Samaria. It was founded under the leadership of Philip&#44; who was one of those firstDeacons chosen in Jerusalem. In the interim&#44; he had progressed to the position of Elder since he is spoken of as Philip theEvangelist in Acts 21:8. There is no indication that either the Apostles or the church at Jerusalem sent him to Samaria. His mission to Samaria was not a pre-planned evangelistic mission. We see strong evidence within this very chapter that he was an Elder of the body of Christ who moved under the direction of the head of the church&#44; the Lord Jesus Christ. Notice Acts 8:26&#44;29&#44;39&#44; &quot;The Angle of the Lord spake unto Philip&#44;&quot; &quot;The Spirit said unto Philip&#44;&quot; &quot;The Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip.&quot;').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.If only the leadership of the churches of today would be under the same leadership and direction. How much better than man&apos;s leadership or that of some headquarter doing the directing. There were no superiors&#44; or mission boards directing the New Testament church but&#44; rather&#44; the Holy Ghost directed it. How much better off our churches would be today if they would rely wholly and completely upon His direction.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The next church&#44; documented in Acts 10&#44; was established at Cornelius&apos; house at Caesarea. Here&#44; again&#44; we see that it was completely and altogether under divine direction and not under man&apos;s direction. God used a series of supernatural means to bring about the establishment of this church&#44; even against Peter&apos;s better judgement&#44; who was the instrument used to be the founder of this church. For we see that Peter&#44; a Jew would not enter into tho home of a Gentile&#44; which Cornelius was. However&#44; God&#44; through a vision&#44; convinced Peter that it was completely God&apos;s will for him to go into Cornelius&apos; house and preach to them.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Finally&#44; we see the church of Antioch being set in order in Acts 11:19-30. This church was not established by the original Apostles but by other able men called and chosen of God for this purpose. Never&#44; never&#44; never&#44; in Scripture do we see one church put in a place of authority over another church. This is an important principle of church government for us to keep in mind. Authority over the local church is&#44; only and always&#44; the responsibility of the local church leadership&#44; under the direction of the &quot;ONE HEAD&#44;&quot; the Lord Jesus Christ&#44; by the anointing of His Spirit.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.While on this thought&#44; I would like to mention that the principle of local independence is the patter for the ministry of the Elders. Pastors have no authority over other Pastors&#44; nor do Apostles have authority over Pastors&#44; etc. The authority of each individual within the five-fold ministry lies within each ones own sphere of ministry&#44; &quot;For we are laborers together with God&#44;&quot; (I Corinthians 3:9). An Elder is not under the direction of other ministries&#44; yet we do see that the Elders of the local assembly do release other Elders to the clear leading of the Holy Ghost for that individual&apos;s life and ministry.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Notice in Acts 13:2-4 that Paul and Barnabas were released&#44; not sent&#44; by the remaining Elders at Antioch that they might follow the clear leading of the Holy Ghost&#44; who in reality is the one doing the sending. If there is a need for disciplining an erring Elder&#44; it is the responsibility of the responsibility of other Elders within the given local assembly to administer the discipline.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.This is a good place to stress the necessity of all Elders being part of a local assembly yet free to work out of the local assembly. However&#44; some may choose not to be part of a local body to their own detriment. It could be that they would rather not be in the position where discipline could be administered when needed.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Each Elder is responsible to minister the Word with&#44; &quot;power and demonstration of the Spirit&#44;&quot; (I Corinthians 2:4). Only then will our ministry be effective. It is alwasy well to remember that our ministry is not to have dominion over the souls of men&#44; but to be &quot;HELPERS&#44;&quot; in building their faith according to the power that works in us (II Corinthians 1:24; Ephesians 3:20b).').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Though one church&#44; or one Elder&#44; does not have dominion over another there is a New Testament pattern for &quot;mothering&quot; churches. Keep in mind&#44; however&#44; that it is for the purpose of sheltering the new body in its infancy. When &quot;mothering&quot; a new church we are to help provide scriptural ministry&#44; to help establish and protect her in her early stages. It should be solely&#44; not an administrative relationship. Also it should be a completely voluntary relationship on both ends of the ministry--the mother church and the mothered church.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.All leaders of both assemblies must qualify for leadership as per I Timothy 3. It should be the call of the Elder or Elders establishing the new assembly to do so. It is not to be the decision of the mother church to establish the new work. She is simply there for support and protection in the early period of the new church&apos;s life.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In concluding our thoughts concerning the first churches to be established in Acts 1-12 we must recognize the special call of the Apostles. Jesus called the twelve&#44; &quot;And it came to pass in those days&#44; that he went out into a mountain to pray&#44; and continued all night in prayer to God. And when it was day&#44; he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve&#44; whom also he named Apostles&#44;&quot; (Luke 6:12&#44;13). This was in the divine plan and design for the church. ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The number twelve represents divine government and administration. A brief look at some Bible twelve&apos;s will bear this out. Jacob had twelve sons who became the twelve tribes of Israel. At Elim we see twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees (Exodus 15:27). Could this be typical of these twelve sons and the seventy elders of Israel in the Old Testament and the twelve Apostles along with the seventy Jesus send out in Luke 9:1; 10:1?').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In the Tabernacle we see the twelve stones in the Breastplate (Exodus 28:21)&#44; twelve loaves of shewbread (Leviticus 24:5). In the Temple twelve oxen bore the molten sea (I Kings 7:25). These are similar to the twelve Apostles who bore the Gospel of cleansing&#44; with the washing of water by the Word (Ephesians 5:26).').'</p>

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In the light of all of this we must say that the twelve Apostles had a unique place in the building of the church. First&#44; we must recognize that they were personally chosen&#44; trained and commissioned by the Lord Jesus Himself. Thus&#44; their word and doctrine was final and authoritative&#44; &quot;And they continued steadfast in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship&#44;&quot; (Acts 2:42). Paul also wrote that the Church was&#44; &quot;&hellip;built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets&#44;&quot; (Ephesians 2:20).').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In this aspect of their work and ministry&#44; the Twelve had no successors. This part of their ministry was &quot;PERFECT&quot; and &quot;PERMANENT&quot;. However&#44; their ministry of church planting and caring is a continuing ministry.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The last sixteen chapters of Acts cover the expansion of the church outside Judea. We see churches being established throughout the Roman Empire. Roughly seven years was spent on ministry solely within Judea&#44; before this expansion began. The church&#44; the body of believers&#44; not just the local assembly&#44; was well established both numerically and spiritually. Those that were scattered were not babes in Christ. This may possible provide a good clue as to why&#44; when the church began to establish local churches&#44; throughout the Roman Empire&#44; they grew rapidly both numerically and spiritually.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Next&#44; I would like us to take a brief look at the church in Antioch&#44; the third largest city in the Empire. While the church remained at Jerusalem&#44; the bud of Christianity opened&#44; but when it reached Antioch it burst forth into full bloom. The congregation at Antioch was&#44; naturally&#44; a strong Gentile congregation while the one at Jerusalem was strongly Jewish. The Gentile church was vividly portrayed in Ephesians 2:11-22. This church was not established by the twelve Apostles&#44; yet it was built upon their foundation (Ephesians 2:20) since the church was built upon their doctrine&#44; even though their bodily presence was absent.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We see the five-fold ministry spring forth in its fullness at Antioch&#44; &quot;Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain Prophets and Teachers&#44;&quot; (Acts 13:1).

There may be other forms of church government that we could consider &#44; but we will limit our study to the two extremes typified in Revelation Chapters 2 and 3.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.These two extremes are illustrated by the NICOLAITANE and LAODICEAN spirit (Revelation 2:6&#44; 15; 3:14). NICOLAITANE is derived from two Greek words meaning&#44; &quot;to conquer the people&quot;. LAODICEAN is take from two Greek words meaning &quot;the justice of the people&quot;. These were not the only two churches seen to utilize the two major extremes in church government. THese two forms of government have been prevalent throughout the Church Age&#44; and are still seen today in the vast majority of churches.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Let us look briefly at the Laodicean spirit. It symbolizes the form of government that adheres to the principle of the &quot;Justice-Rule-Democracy&quot; of the people. Many of our churches today operate under this flag.

All officers and matters of business are decided upon by a vote of the body of believers.').'</p>

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Unfortunately&#44; the voice of the majority is all too often a carnal voice. Under this system churches often choose&#44; to their own destruction or at least to their own destruction or at least to their own detriment&#44; pastor&apos;s who are not God&apos;s choice for that local assembly at that time. Often&#44; under this Democratic&#44; or might we say Laodicean&#44; spirit&#44; the pastor&apos;s hands are tied as he tries to follow the leading of the Holy Ghost when it comes to the leadership of the local assembly. As we can readily see without any further explanation&#44; this Spirit must be soundly opposed and resisted as not being God&apos;s will for the local assembly.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Let us now look at the other end of the spectrum&#44; the NICOLAITANE Spirit. This makes reference to a dictatorial type of of church government or the Papal type of church government. It speaks to us of the clergy becoming a ruling class.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The dictatorial type of church government ignores the Scriptural teaching of the &quot;priesthood of the believer&#44;&quot; as seen in I Peter 2:9.

Paul also teaches this in Hebrews 4:16:').'</p>

They also need to recognize that there is a need&#44; at times&#44; for calling upon the elders for prayer and the laying on of hands. An over-emphasis on the doctrine of laying on of hands&#44; solely by the Elders&#44; could have created this &quot;Nicolaitane spirit&quot; and error within the church.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Let us look at some of the consequences&#44; which will naturally arise when the Nicolaitane spirit prevails in a local body of believers. The first malfunctioning of the assembly&#44; will be that the leadership of the church will not only control the manifestation of the gifts in the assembly&#44; but they themselves will often be the only ones functioning in these gifts. This monopoly on the gifts of the Spirit suppresses all other believers from operating via the gifts of the Holy Ghost.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The suppression of the operation of the gifts will not always be outward or direct but will often happen through indirect means or simply through the projection of the leadership&apos;s domineering spirit.

The Scriptural pattern&#44; as seen in I Corinthians 12:7&#44; is for each member to move and function as the Holy Ghost would direct&#44; &quot; But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to ever man to profit withal.&quot; The Nicolaitane Spirit ignores this pattern as it disregards the &quot;priesthood of the believer&quot;.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The root cause of many men resorting to this form of leadership is twofold. It takes both &quot;Self-Denial&quot; and the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; of the &quot;Flesh&quot; on the part of a leader to permit the Spirit to use who He will to minster as He would. It requires faith to trust the Holy Ghost to govern the affairs of the church. It is much easier to the &quot;CARNAL&quot; natural man to do things in a natural way&#44; especially if the individual is endued with natural gifts and charisma. The sad result is that this seems to be very successful.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.One weakness of the modern pastorate is that he fails to produce a strong lay ministry.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.To develop spiritual people we must permit the exercise of spiritual ministry and spiritual gifts.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There seems to be some confusion today concerning the difference between TEACHING people and LEADING people in to an actual ministry of exercising of their gifts and callings. LEADING must occur in public and in private counsel. LEADING must include encouragement to help the believer cooperate with the Holy Ghost&#44; as He would use them. The spiritual effectiveness of a church can only be measured by its ability to function effectively as a body. We need a thorough restoration of the body ministry today&#44; which will produce an increase of the body through the salvation of souls.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.One last error which prevails as a result of the Nicolaitane spirit today is the funneling off of promising young ministries to the Bible Schools. This directly results from the failure to nurture a body ministry within the local church. Those with promise arise in our assemblies during times of spiritual renewal and show yieldedness to the moving of the Holy Ghost. Due to the lack of capable leaders within the local body who will take them under their wing and train them for the work of the ministry&#44; we ship them off.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Many problems arise for local assemblies&#44; which encourage promising young men to attend Bible School rather than remain in their local churches to receive training. First&#44; we are taking the lifeblood and vitality out of the local assembly.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Second&#44; this practice places the promising young enthusiast into a false atmosphere.

Students do not experience the real tests&#44; trials&#44; and responsibilities of every day life.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.When many students come out of the Bible School atmosphere to take leadership in the local assembly&#44; their lack of any practical experience in the everyday life of the Christian results in disappointment at the absence of the high gear&#44; hyper-spiritual atmosphere which they are accustomed to in the Bible School. I am speaking primarily of those who have had little or no local church affiliation previous to the Bible School experience.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Third&#44; the Bible School now is overloaded with what we might call &quot;The Cream of the Crop&#44;&quot; as far as zeal and enthusiasm is concerned.

The Bible School not only has no scriptural means for bodily members since each Christian is directed to be a part of a local church but also has no Scriptural means for financial support. If the local church is God&apos;s order for this Church Age&#44; our tithes and offering are to be brought into the local church.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Having spelled out some of the errors of the dictatorial or Nicolaitane form of church government&#44; let us briefly compare this erroneous spirit with the spirit of theocracy. The dictator is no-submissive to other leadership ministries.

The dictator sees challenges of his decisions as a threat instead of a check&#44; which may bring balance within the assembly. ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We have looked at the Democratic and the Dictatorial types of church government and the problems associated with these is that they are not God&apos;s order.

Jesus is the only perfect dictator. The Nicolaitane spirit violates God&apos;s order for multiple ministries.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We must understand that the Dictator might simply lack understanding of what God&apos;s ideal is. It may not be that his motives are wrong.

Healthy growth&#44; which always tales time&#44; is a good measuring stick for success.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There are definite problems&#44; which arise when leadership predominates the body ministry. An assembly may survive&#44; even for a prolonged period&#44; with these problems evident internally&#44; however she will be a weak assembly. The domineering spitit steals initiative and joy from the body and replaces it with fear&#44; frustration&#44; antagonism and resentment. A ministry of this type attracts weak&#44; overly dependent believers and creates division and a lack of harmony.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Good church government must begin in the heart. For God can only govern through a man if he is able to govern the man himself.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There are certain principles of church government which must be observed if we are to have a healthy church.

We must inculcate this into them if at all possible&#44; and&#44; as we do&#44; permit God to draw the team together he so desires.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Fourth&#44; all too often leaders are afraid to encourage fellowship among the flock. Their fear of this may be justified.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Fifth&#44; one predominate mistake among leaders in these early stages is that they busy themselves with &quot;waiting on tables&quot;. The result is that leaders are overworked. This error conditions the body to the spirit of &quot;letting the leaders do it&quot;.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Many are still asking&#44; &quot;How can I develop or produce a body ministry within my flock?&quot; A leader&apos;s ultimate success or failure seems to rest on his ability or lack of ability to produce a body ministry in his assembly.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The alternatives are to either drop out of the ministry&#44; to retrogress to the Laodicean or Democratic type of church government&#44; or to become a spiritual dictator.

Some have seemed to be successful at the dictatorial type of church government as long as they have lived&#44; but what happens when the &quot;dictator&quot; dies? The work generally crumbles and the sheep scatter-some lost forever. Personally&#44; I&apos;ll settle for God&apos;s pattern as difficult as it is at times to develop. It is worth all the discipline and effort involved&#44; for it yields tremendous rewards.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We need the ability to draw people out and not suppress them. In this process we need a balance between a strong hand of restraint and guidance&#44; while leaving room for freedom of expression. To do this effectively&#44; the Pastor must be totally involved with the flock in prayer&#44; fellowship&#44; and worship. This should include times of extracurricular activities when possible.

The greatest danger to this kind of ministry by itself is that its adherents seem&#44; more often than not&#44; to live inconsistent lifestyles. This occurs because much&#44; if not all&#44; of their motivation is external rather than internal.

I&apos;m sure that they were qualified before Barnabas&#44; Saul and possibly even&#44; Agabus would set them into a place of leadership. We even see the church at Antioch sending Elders from themselves to minister to others. Is not this the Scriptural pattern&mdash;&quot;freely ye have received&#44; freely give&quot;? We are commanded to go into the entire world and make disciples&#44; not just sit at home and grow fat spiritually.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The church of Ephesus is another good example of the plurality of Elders. As discussed in Acts 18:18&#44;19&#44; the plurality of Elders was even seen in the pioneering stages of this church. God doesn&apos;t mean for one man to be responsible for a work by himself. His pattern&#44; even in the early stages of a work is for two or more ministries to work together. We see&#44; in Acts 20:17&#44; that more Elders were evidently added to the church.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.This seems to have been the pattern&#44; wherever churches were started. Paul and Barnabas set in a plurality of Elders in all the churches that they established (Acts 14:23). Whenever assistance was sent to the churches&#44; it was delivered by the Elders of one church into the hands of the Elders of receiving church. The Elders are always to play a predominant roll in the leadership of the churches.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.I feel to emphasize again that you will never find the word Elder in its singular form when in reference to leadership over the church. Yet we must affirm that one Elder is generally considered as &quot;chief&quot;&#44; &quot;senior&quot; or &quot;head&quot; Elder within the local assembly. There are several men who were considered &quot;head&quot; Elders in the New Testament church. For example&#44; Peter (Acts 5:3)&#44; James&#44; the Lords brother&#44; (Acts 15:13) and definitely Paul who established churches and remained to mature them. We also have the letters to the churches in Revelation Chapters 2 and 3&#44; which were to be given to the &quot;angels&quot;&#44; &quot;messengers&quot;&#44; or the chief Elder of those individual churches.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Even though the scripture is emphatic in teaching a plurality of Elders&#44; it does not teach an equality of Elders. Each ministry must be given freedom to function within its own sphere&#44; and each will more likely be at different levels of maturity and capabilities in their given ministries. There is to be no power struggle. Each Elder has his own ministry&#44; which he is responsible for.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.One astounding purpose for the plurality of Elders is found in the sphere of church discipline . Discipline carried out by one man loses its effect and authority. It often does not accomplish its intended purpose&mdash;restoration. Instead&#44; it often stimulates rebellion and the loss of the one being disciplined. A plurality of leadership encourages submission from the flock. The decisions of a group of spiritual men will be adhered too much more readily than that of on man. A plurality of Elders is protection for Elders and flock alike bringing with it the greatest benefit to both sheep and shepherd.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The plurality of Elders and church discipline is also to be considered in the context of the need for the discipline of Elders as well. Under God&apos;s pattern of leadership&#44; no man is standing independent of the whole. The plurality of the Elders leaves opportunity for an Elder to be disciplined as well as and as effectively as any member of the body. This is equally true whether he be Pastor&#44; Teacher&#44; Evangelist&#44; Prophet&#44; or Apostle. We need to &quot;submit to one another&#44;&quot; for the good of the whole body (I Peter 5:5).').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Another positive effect of plurality of Elders&#44; is the fact that it brings proper &quot;balance&quot; to the body in all matters. Since each of the Elders will not only be at a different level of maturity but will also have a different type of ministry&#44; the Elders will be able to augment on another in the feeding ministry and in the ministry of the Word. This is also true of discipline. In disciplinary matters&#44; a plurality of Elders brings checks in various ways as to either speeding or slowing the process as need may be.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In the remainder of this chapter&#44; I would like us to briefly analyze Acts 15. This chapter has been used and abused to support every conceivable type of church government. It has been used to support denominational authority of local churches since this chapter can be used to show that the church at Jerusalem had authority over other churches. Acts 15 has also been used to support the contention that the senior pastor is the final voice of authority within the local church since James&#44; the chief elder&#44; had the final voice. However&#44; none of these contentions are supported if we carefully exam the situation as it is literally recorded in Holy Writings.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Brethren from the Jerusalem church who had brought erroneous teaching to Antioch and were causing division had infiltrated the church in Antioch. Paul and Barnabas&#44; mature brethren&#44; did what was right and proper by going to the root and source of the problem when they confronted the Elders of the church in Jersualem&#44; the home church of the troublesome brethren. They presented the problem&#44; which these brethren had brought and sowed&#44; into the Antioch church. The whole church at Jerusalem eventually became involved&#44; or at least informed&#44; about what was transpiring. It is very evident from the scripture that they were in agreement with the decisions of their Elders. What a healthy situation as we see the Elders all together in getting the mind of the Spirit-even though it was the chief Elder what that mind was. Then&#44; praise God&#44; the whole church body stood behind the decision of their Elders. Please study Acts 15 carefully in relation to this thought.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The church in Jerusalem was sought out&mdash;not because it was the top ecclesiastical authority&#44; but because it was the source of the problem. James&#44; the senior Pastor at Jerusalem&#44; voiced the final decision of the whole and not just that of himself. It was definitely a &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot;&#44; and was confirmed by all present. There were no powers of persuasion&#44; or gifts of salesmanship&#44; influencing the minds of others. Rather&#44; there was a definite word of the Holy Ghost to direct the affairs of the local church&#44; which is always in order.').'</p>

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In the next few chapters of this book we will be looking at the separate ministries of the apostle&#44; prophet&#44; evangelist&#44; pastor&#44; and teacher. We will be looking at them in the order given in Ephesians 4:11 not because this is necessarily their order of importance&#44; but simply because this is the order in which the key verse mentions them.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The first task to complete in considering the ministry of an apostle is to decide upon a definition of an apostle. An apostle is one sent forth as a messenger&#44; with a commission&#44; under the authority of one doing the sending. This defers from the definition of a disciple since a disciple is a follower who follows with the intent of learning and putting what is learned into practice. All true Christians are disciples (including those who apostles).').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In relation to the Christian faith&#44; an apostle is one called out from among the disciples and sent forth as seen in Luke 6:13 &quot;and when it was day&#44; he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve&#44; whom he also named apostles&quot;. With these thoughts behind us&#44; we will now look at New Testament Scriptures pertaining to the ministry of an apostle. In doing so we will observe the different examples of apostles. ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The first example of an apostle is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself. Truly&#44; he is our example in all matters pertaining to the Christian faith and ministry. In Hebrews 3:1 he is spoken of as: &quot;the Apostle and High Priest of our profession.&quot; These titles speak to us of his relationship to God and his ministry to man. He was definitely one sent forth with a Divine Commission. Thank God that he was not only &quot;sent forth&quot;&#44; but that he was obedient to the end to carry out the fathers will. This is clearly illustrated in Christ&apos;s own words in John 17:3-8.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The next example of the ministry of the apostle is the calling and work of the original twelve as listed in Matthew 10:2-4&#44; Mark 3:14-19&#44; Luke 6:13-16. The original twelve apostles as well as all succeeding apostles were chosen from those who were already disciples.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.As with any of the fivefold ministry&#44; all apostles are personally chosen by the Lord Jesus Himself. It is not within the authority or choice of men to appoint apostles nor to appoint any of the others of the fivefold ministry. The most that man can do is confim those that God has chosen.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.One important factor I would like us to notice in this all important decision of Jesus in choosing the twelve is that he spent the previous night in prayer (Luke 6:12). This within itself tells us that the Lord takes great care in His choice of leaders for his work.. IT should also speak to us of the necessity of&#44; saturating major decisions with much prayer to God before coming to a final conclusion. This is also true in the practice of laying hands upon those to be set apart for the service of God in any special ministry.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The original twelve apostles (possibly with the exclusion of Judas Iscariot) were to have a place of permanence throughout the ages&mdash;along with the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel (Revelation 21:14). This in itself should cause us to move prayerfully as we work for God&#44; for how much of what we are doing is of eternal value').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The third category of apostle mentioned in the New Testament is the false apostle. Satan is not going to waste time&#44; talent&#44; and labor copying anything that is not genuine. Thus&#44; when I see one of counterfeits around I know that there must also be the authentic&#44; &quot;Real&quot; ministry being copied. This is also true of prophets&#44; evangelists&#44; pastors&#44; and teachers. God has the genuine and Satan has the counterfeit or false. Don&apos;t be disillusioned by the false but be encourage that the real is genuine enough for Satan to be willing to expand the effort to copy it.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There was on apostle who seems to have had a special call to establish the church among the Gentiles. This&#44; of course&#44; is none other than Paul&#44; who was previously known as Saul of Tarsus (Romans 11:13&#44; Acts 9:15). He speaks of Himself over twenty times as an apostle. He was the first man recorded to make any systematic effort to evangelize the Gentiles. Some have reason to believe that he is the Divine replacement of Judas Iscariot rather than the Matthias of Acts 1:26.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The ministry of an apostle is to be a continuing ministry throughout the Church Age. God gave this ministry&#44; along with the other four&#44; as a gift to the church to bring her to perfection. It is impossible to imagine that the ministry of an apostle could be discontinued before the church is brought to perfection&#44; at the end of this Church Age. We still need every gift that God has given to the church. When the church has come to perfection&#44; it will be presented to Christ without spot or wrinkle or any such thing (Ephesians 5:27). He is coming for a perfect bride. I&#44; for one&#44; feel the need for every provision he has made to bring me to perfection. Because certain fragments of the church have failed to recognize and utilize all the gifts and ministries that Christ provided her&#44; they are in the poor condition they are in today.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There are various references in the New Testament to apostiles&#44; other tha n Paul or the twelve as discusses previously. There were apostles with Paul in Iconium as well as in other places of miniustry (Acts 14:4; Romans 16:7; Galatians 1:19; I Thessalonians 1:1&#44; 2:6). We find the word &quot;Apostle&quot; possibly applies to about twenty-five persons in the New Testament since it is also sometimes translated &quot;Messenger&quot;. Titus seems to have fit into this category since he was one who was establishing churches and setting things in order within the local churches (Titus 1:5).').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Next&#44; we will examine the ministry of the New Testament apostle. In any study of this nature&#44; there are some questions that we must ask ourselves. First&#44; who sent the apostles mentioned in the New Testament? Second&#44; where were they sent? Third&#44; what was the commission of these men?').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.In answering these questions we will begin with the original twelve. They were called&#44; trained and sent by Christ Himself. They were sent to the worldwide church. This mission continues&#44; even to the end of the Church Age&#44; via their ministry of laying down the foundational truths for the entire Church Age. Paul wrote&#44; in Ephesians 2:20: &quot;And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets&#44; Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.&quot;').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The ministry of the original twelve apostles seems to go even beyond the Church Age and into eternity (Revelation 21:14). Their writings were inspired and preserved as &quot;Gospel&quot;. They were truly a young church and a means of nurturing her to maturity. They set forth the early structure of the church&#44; outlined the qualifications for the ministering body and took the initiative to see that proper leadership was set in place. They baptized converts&#44; preached the gospel&#44; taught doctrine&#44; etc.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The ministry of apostle is an ongoing ministry for the church of all ages. The ministry of an apostle today is similar to that of the twelve. A modern day apostle must be chosen&#44; trained&#44; and sent by Christ just as the original twelve were. Ther are to ground the church in the truth that has already been laid down so that the church will not be blown about with every wind of doctrine. The twelve laid down the &quot;Foundational Truths&quot; which the apostles of today are to minister.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The vision of today&apos;s apostles goes beyond one local assembly since they are sent to the church at large. Their ministry will expand as pastors recognize the call of God upon their lives and call upon them for assistance. A man will never have to push his way to the front&#44; &quot;(his) ministry will make room for itself&quot; (Proverbs 18:16). The ministry of the modern day apostle will be one of seeking to preserve unity and cooperation within and among local assemblies. We see this spirit vividly in the ministry of Paul&#44; in his striving to write to those who are divisive&#44; as in the church of Corinth.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Apostles are also to be concerned with the ministries of individuals. They will endeavor to nurture promising young men into their ministries&#44; sometimes by taking them under their wing for a season of training. They will also&#44; at times&#44; as the Spirit leads&#44; function via the gifts of the Spirit in confirming God&apos;s call upon specific members of the local assemblies.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The present day apostle may also be active in establishing new churches and setting the new churches in order&#44; returning to them on occasion to nurture and strengthen them in their faith. We have not only the example of Paul and Barnabas but also of many modern missionaries who function along this line. It is possible these brethren are considered apostles in the eyes of the Lord.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.It would not be correct to include all missionaries in this category since many serve as clerks&#44; doctors&#44; mechanics&#44; pilots&#44; etc. in the mission field. However&#44; some are true apostles as well as prophets&#44; evangelists&#44; pastors&#44; and teachers. The ministry and works that follow a man will be proof of his calling.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The ministry of the prophet is mentioned more frequently in Scripture than any of the other five-fold ministries.

In the Old Testament the Priests and Levites who are types of the Elders and Deacons of the New Testament carried out the bulk of the ministry.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Despite the number of times that the ministry of the prophet is mentioned&#44; it is important to realize that&#44; although this ministry is needed today&#44; it is not the only one needed. The ministry of the prophet is but one of the five-fold ministries. As we continue on in our study&#44; I trust that we will find healthy New Testament balance in this ministry as well as in all of the others.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There are several Old and New Testament words&#44; which will help us to understand more fully the ministry of the prophet. The Hebrew word REAH is translated in the Kings James Version as &quot;seer&quot; in I Samuel 9:9. It suggests that the Prophet actually &quot;sees&quot; what God wants him to relay to his people. God will reveal Himself to prophets in visions or dreams:').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->."&quot;Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you&#44; I the Lord will make 	myself known unto him in a vision&#44; and will speak unto him in a 	dream&#44;&quot; (Numbers 12:6)."').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The Prophet is caught up in the Spirit in a visionary state where he sees great spiritual revelations. This refers not only to dreams and visions but also to the interpretation of dreams or visions (Daniel 2:23; 4:19-27; 8:15-27).').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The Hebrew word NABHI or NABILY is translated &quot;Prophet&quot; in Amos 3:7. It makes reference to one to whom God&apos;s message was secretly revealed. The prophecy then springs or flows forth from the prophet to the people. Prophets receive the message from God more by HEARING than by SEEING. The message is received in secret but is spoken by them openly. This is the most common word used in reference to the Old Testament prophets. The word &quot;NABHI&quot; includes rather than excludes the seer since all of God&apos;s prophets receive a message from God&#44; which is to be relayed to the people.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There are a few New Testament words&#44; which relate to the office and ministry of the prophet. The word &quot;PROPHETS&quot; as seen in Acts 11:27 and 13:1 refers to one who speaks forth or relays the &quot;Divine Message&quot; or &quot;Mind of God&quot; to man. The work of a prophet is presented primarily as a &quot;FORTH TELLING&quot;. However&#44; included in the ministry of the prophet may be the work of &quot;FORE TELLING&quot;. The latter is what most imagines to be the primary task of the prophet even though it is the former function&#44; which the New Testament prophets performed most frequently.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Another New Testament word relating to the ministry of the prophet is the word &quot;MOVED&quot; as found in II Peter 1:21:').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->."&quot;For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man&#44; but Holy men of god 	spake as they were MOVED by the Holy Ghost.&quot;"').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.This Scripture is referring to the fact that the prophets were borne or carried along in much the same way as the wind bears a sailboat across the waters. The prophets were under God&apos;s strong&#44; controlling influence as they functioned in their office or ministry. This is not meant to imply that they were not capable of resisting God&apos;s will since &quot;the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets&#44;&quot; (I Corinthians 14:32). ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.Even though I Corinthians 14:32 is specifically dealing with the abuse of the gifts and callings of God it also illustrates that it is very possible to resist the moving of the Spirit of God as He would bare us along. When God directs us in this manner&#44; it is not against our will but&#44; rather&#44; in harmony with our willingness to yield to His Spirit. The prophet is never in a position where he is at liberty to say&#44; &quot;I couldn&apos;t help myself&#44;&quot; though he is definitely under a certain amount of pressure because of what God has shown him. He is to be knowingly and willingly borne along by the Spirit. ').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.There are three words seen in Revelation 1:1 which I would like us to observe:').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->."&quot;The Revelation&quot; of Jesus Christ&#44; which God gave unto him to &quot;Shew&quot; unto His 	servant things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and &quot;Signified&quot; it by 	his angel unto his servant John&quot;."').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We will look at these three terms in the order in which they appear--not in their order of importance&#44; if there is any such order.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The word &quot;Revelation&quot; means to reveal or make known by unveiling or taking the cover off. It makes reference to the impartation of spiritual knowledge&#44; which could not be arrived at in any other fashion-that which would be otherwise unknown. A natural example of this spiritual phenomenon is that all of a sudden a light comes on which has been completely the work of God.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The word &quot;SHEW&quot; is also found in Revelation 1:1. It suggests the EXHIBITION or SHOWING BY WAY OF PROVING the message. The final word they I will be discussing is &quot;SIGNIFIED&quot; which means to indicate or give a sign. Goth &quot;signified&quot; and &quot;show&quot; refer to providing a clear picture of the message to be relayed to the people. It may include dreams&#44; visions&#44; or even prophecy with demonstration (almost as a pantomime with words added to give a double message).').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.We will end our word study of the ministry of the prophet with the word &quot;INSPIRATION&quot; as found in II Timothy 3:16: &quot;All Scripture is given by INSPIRATION of God.&quot; The word literally means&#44; &quot;God Breathed&quot;. It makes reference to the recorded word&#44; which was divinely revealed and preserved for all ages. God not only took care to reveal it and have it spoken correctly but also to preserve it throughout all ages for the benefit of the church. He was and is truly concerned for you and I as well as for those who were alive in the days in which the Word was received and spoken.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.A prophet is one who receives a divine message from God&#44; relating to God&apos;s will and purpose and who&#44; in turn&#44; delivers that message to men. It may not necessarily be confirmed to the people of God. Many of the Old Testament prophets had a message for the ungodly as well as for the people of God. He is God&apos;s mouthpiece to the people&#44; or God&apos;s point of contact with the people. Prophets not only serve as the mouthpiece of God (II Peter 1:21; Hebrews 1:1; and Acts 3:21) but also&#44; because of their spiritual vision&#44; can be though of as the &quot;eyes&quot; of the church. The job of the prophet is to lead the people into the light of what God has revealed to His messenger.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.As the New Testament pattern is restored&#44; we will see a greater restoration of the office of the prophet within the church. As we will see in the remainder of this chapter&#44; there is a need for this if the restoration work is to be complete.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The message of the prophet is threefold. It is PREDICTIVE&#44; DIRECTIVE&#44; and CORRECTIVE. The ministry of the prophet is predictive since it speaks of events that are in the future for the purpose of preparing those to whom the message is given for that which is ahead. A prophet&apos;s message should help those to whom it is given to determine God&apos;s will as they plan.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The message of the prophet is also directive. Do not confuse this aspect of the ministry of the prophet with the ministry of the teacher. It is part of the prophet&apos;s ministry to give specific direction to specific people&#44; under specific circumstances. Examples of this can be seen in I Samuel 22:5&#44; I Kings 22:14-23; and Acts 21:10. God is faithful to direct His people properly if we will be open to the voice of God. This facet of the prophet&apos;s ministry may very well be God&apos;s means of confirming what he has already been dealing with us on concerning His will for our life and ministry.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The prophetic ministry may also be corrective. It speaks out against sin&#44; rebellion&#44; backsliding or doctrinal error as need be. Almost always the corrective&#44; or rebuking message of the prophet will be accompanied by a promise of mercy upon repentance. God does not rejoice in the death of the wicked&#44; but gives corrective messages that they may repent and be restored. God&apos;s hear is not set on destruction but on restoration.').'</p>
<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.A true man of God&#44; when rebuking will himself be more hurt than the individual that is rebuked. If he can whip the sheep without feeling pain himself&#44; he is definitely in the wrong spirit. It is never enjoyable to rebuke others. Remember the prophet is borne along with great pressure from God to give his message. His sole reason for doing so is the direction of God as well as the knowledge that it very possibly will bring restoration to the recipient. On the other hand&#44; we cannot rule out those isolated instances where God is withdrawing his mercy from those who he has dealt with time and again. In this situation&#44; His corrective message may well be without mercy as seen in Acts 5:1-10 and Numbers 16:31-33. ').'</p>

Some prophets were mentioned as traveling from Jerusalem to Antioch. One prophet&#44; Agabus&#44; certainly functioned in a prophetic office. He is referred to in this sense in both Acs 11:27&#44;28 and Acts 21:10. Judas and Silas were also mentioned as prophets in Acts 15:3. There were certainly several individual prophets present in the New Testament church.

<p>'.trans('<!--local-church-->.The ministry of the prophet today&#44; just as the ministry of the apostle&#44; differs in form with the Old and New Testament prophets only in the fact that the latter two laid down the foundational truths and the former are to continue ministering this truth.
