We must </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">relate</span><span class="csA7555675"> to the local body as an </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">active</span><span class="csA7555675"> member of that body. No man is an </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">island</span><span class="csA7555675"> to himself. To </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">separate</span><span class="csA7555675"> ourselves from the local body is </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">unscriptural</span><span class="csA7555675">. We are all </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">parts</span><span class="csA7555675"> of the same body. Not one of us is to be </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">independent</span><span class="csA7555675"> of the other. It is God&rsquo;s </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">plan</span><span class="csA7555675"> and </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">purpose</span><span class="csA7555675"> that each member of His universal body be </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">joined</span><span class="csA7555675"> to a local body of believers. Today many do not seem to realize that the local church is God&rsquo;s </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">permanent</span><span class="csA7555675"> </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">order</span><span class="csA7555675"> for this age, which is the church age. The </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">structure</span><span class="csA7555675"> of the local church may very with size or locality, but it is still God&rsquo;s order for this age.</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">The local church is God&rsquo;s </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">pattern</span><span class="csA7555675"> for </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">evangelizing</span><span class="csA7555675"> the world and bringing His people to </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">maturity</span><span class="csA7555675">. A man or woman who </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">refuses</span><span class="csA7555675"> to join themselves to a local body of believers often feels they are </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">wasting</span><span class="csA7555675"> their </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">effort</span><span class="csA7555675">. </span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">Church </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">order</span><span class="csA7555675"> and </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">leadership</span><span class="csA7555675"> were clearly seen in the Old Testament. Aaron and his four sons were a </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">type</span><span class="csA7555675"> of the </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">fivefold</span><span class="csA7555675"> ministry seen in the New Testament. Within the </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">tabernacle</span><span class="csA7555675"> itself there was a designated place of </span><span class="csDCC2CFE">worship</span><span class="csA7555675">.</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">The believer was not to remain at home to worship, but he was to gather with the local body in a designated place of worship. There is no Scriptural basis for remaining at home to worship while the local body is gathering even if you do enjoy the &ldquo;electronic evangelist&rdquo; more than the local elders. This type of spirit is a rebellious an independent spirit and is contrary to the clear teaching of the Word of God.</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">The watchmen on the walls of the cities of Israel are a type of the leaders of the New Testament church, who are watching for our souls. It is the responsibility of the elders to guard against those with erroneous teachings, who would kill and destroy the body of believers. The shepherds upon the hillsides of Judah and Israel were a type of God&rsquo;s chosen leadership for His church today. They are not only trusted with the care and guidance of the flock, but also of feeding the flock of God with nourishing spiritual food.</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">In His Word, God offers a pattern for the formation of local churches. First, He directed believers to assemble together in given locations. Next, He ordains where to establish a local church, and often where not to establish a local church. God puts into place the leadership ministries He would have in each local assembly. </span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">Though most in the church recognize that God designates leaders, they do not give much thought about the fact that God also brings in members. We should carefully consider God&rsquo;s placement in the best church for them, especially in this day of running to and fro by many church members. If God sets us in a particular church as members or leaders, we must remain there until God moves us, and not before. Never should we move because we have been offended.</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">Nowhere in Scripture does God teach a denominational type of church government. Each local church is to be a sovereign body, even though they are to enjoy fellowship with other local assemblies.</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">There are some basic principles of church government, which we must observe if we want to fully follow God&rsquo;s pattern. The church is first to be a spiritual &ldquo;organism&rdquo; and then to be an organization. Good church government will not produce spirituality. In the church of the living God there must be life before structure. After there is life, good structure in the form of church government will help to maintain life.</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">As a family requires parents and as a flock requires a shepherd, so the household of faith requires spiritual leaders. We need the fivefold ministry so that we may come to maturity within the body. Leaders cannot give what they do not posses. They must meet the Scriptural qualifications seen in I Timothy chapter 3.</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csD15247B9"><span class="csA7555675">A common error today is the belief that we do not need men to bead us because we have the Holy Spirit to lead us. The Spirit leads and governs the church through human vessels. To bypass everyone and seek leading only from God is usually the sign of a rebellious and independent spirit. These people often use a verse of Scripture out of context such as I John 2:27 to justify refusing submission to God-anointed and God-called teachers. If we choose to reject the teaching that God has ordained a strong oversight ministry within the Body of Christ, God will permit us to find isolated Scriptures to satisfy our rebellion and independence. God appoints leaders and directs them to set the house in order.</span></p></body>
