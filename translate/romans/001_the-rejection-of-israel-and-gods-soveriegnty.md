# The Rejection of Israel and God's Sovereignty (9:6-29)

## The True Israel is According to the Promise, v. 6-10

The majority of Israel has missed the point. Christ is the fulfillment of the law, but Israel stumbles over him as if a stone and hold to their laws and religion. They think they are the children of God because they are the children of Abraham and Isaac and that they are the ones to whom the law was revealed.

The fact that the Jews as a nation rejected the Messiah (Christ) raises the question "Did the Word of God fail?" "Did God fail to carry out His promises"? How does Paul answer these questions? In these next verses Paul is confident that Israel's rejection of the gospel is not unanimous and not permanent&mdash;God is able to graft back in again!

The real Israel is the elect, not a natural seed. We see the plan of God as it unfolds. Not everyone that is born a part of the nationality of Israel are a part of Spiritual Israel. The children of the Israel are only children of the flesh, but the children of the promise are the children of God. (John 3:6 "born of the Spirit"). The New Testament Church is referred to as &quot;the Israel of God&quot; (Galatians 6:16) because of their faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ&mdash;not because of their family lineage.

> Romans 9:6-10&mdash;Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: 7 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. 9 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son. 10 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;

> Romans 10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. 3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.

## Election or Predestination is Not of Works of Him that Calleth, v. 11-13

Election is mentioned in verse eleven.

> Romans 9:11-13&mdash;(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) 12 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

Election or predestination is not an unrighteous act for God may justify whom He may and condemn whom he desires. All the good works of men cannot make them children of the promise, but that condition is dependent upon God showing mercy.

It is important to understand from Scripture how predestination or election works.

Predestination and election is based upon God&apos;s foreknowledge. He knows the end from the beginning He knows who will receive and who will reject before they are even born.

> Romans 8:29&mdash;For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

> William Branham was a man of God and a tent preacher in the mid 1900&apos;s. He was preaching one evening in the tent and a woman came to him near the closing of the service. She said, &quot;Brother Branham, my husband has threatened to kill me if I came to your meetings, again. He is sitting right now in his car in the parking lot holding a shotgun.&quot; Branham went out to the vehicle pulled open the passenger side door and sat down in the front seat. He plead with man concerning his soul for an hour or more. Branham, observing no change in the man, asked one final question. &quot;Do you any intention that at any time in the future you may serve God?&quot; The man arrogantly sounded a resounding, &quot;No!&quot; Branham told him that he saw no reason for him to continue living then, and snapped his fingers and the man died instantly in the driver&apos;s seat.

Some are given 100 years and others only a few. It is man&apos;s responsibility to respond in the time of mercy for turning to God cannot happen just on a man&apos;s whim, but he must be drawn by the Father.

> John 6:44&mdash;No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.

## God is Righteous in Mercy and Hardening, v. 14-18

> Romans 9:14-18&mdash; What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. 17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. 18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

How is God's sovereignty expressed? God is a sovereign God so therefore he is also a just God.

## Clay in the Potters Hand, vs. 19-24

### 2. God is Sovereign (and Man is Responsible) v.20

Acts 5:29

### 3. God is Purposeful v.21

> Romans 9:21&mdash;Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

Compare with JEREMIAH 18 "Go Down to the Potter's House

> Jer 18:1-10&mdash;The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. 3 Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. 4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. 5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 6 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel. 7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; 8 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. 9 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 10 If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.

### 4. God is Right

- Hypothetical "A" v.22

> Romans 9:22&mdash; What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:

- Hypothetical "B" vs.23-24

> Romans 9:23&mdash;And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

Note well the word afore. For the whole process of our salvation is viewed from that blessed future day when we shall enter, through divine mercy, into that glory which God afore appointed us. 24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?

2 Timothy 2:20-21
1 Peter 5:8
Matthew 25:1-10
Galatians 5:4

## The Calling of God's People, v. 25-29

> Romans 9:25-29&mdash;As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. 26 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God. 27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: 28 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. 29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

### Verse 25

Paul here, takes from the prophet Hosea (2:23) a passage that is specifically spoken to Israel, but has not found a fulfillment in Israel but rather is seen fulfilled in the Gentiles receiving the Gospel.

> Hosea 2:23&mdash;And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.

- "I will sow her" Alluding to the import of the name Jezreel (v.22), the seed of God. (Jeremiah 31:27; Zechariah 10:9; Isaiah 61:3).

As a place, The city of Nazareth, Jesus' home town, was on the northern side of Jezreel. It is also called the Great Plain and the Valley of Esdraelon.

In the Bible, the city of Jezreel has a long, violent history. The wife of King Ahab, Jezebel, died when she was thrown from a window of Jezreel's palace, and her body was eaten by dogs (2 Kings 9:30-35). Naboth was murdered in Jezreel when he refused to give King Ahab his vineyard (1 Kings 21:1-23). King Ahab's sons were beheaded and their heads piled at the gates of Jezreel (2 Kings 10:1-11). Jezreel was also the scene of many biblical battles: Deborah's victory over Sisera (Judges 4); the Israelites' victory over the Midianites and the Amalekites (Judges 6&mdash;8); Saul and Jonathan's defeat at the hand of the Philistines (1 Samuel 31); Egypt's victory over King Josiah (2 Kings 23:29).

The Jezreel Valley is now a beautiful farmland, where wheat, cotton, corn, and sunflowers are grown, and herds of sheep and cattle graze. The Valley of Jezreel is also called "The Valley of Megiddo" (Meggido is found within the valley of Jezreel. Meggido means to slaughter or cut off.) and some believe it may be the scene of the battle of Armageddon, according to a passage in Revelation that says "they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon" (Revelation 16:16-21). The word Armageddon is a combination of the word har, meaning mountain or mountain range, and mgiddown, which in English is "Megiddo."

The word "Jezreel" is constructed of two Hebrew words meaning "to sow" and "mighty" or "Almighty" and in combination the meaning is "God will sow." Jezreel is the name Hosea gave to his oldest son in 1:4 which was prophetic. He represented the righteous seed that was and would be sown in Israel.

- The sentences in the latter part of this verse are very abrupt, but exceedingly expressive; leaving out those words supplied by the translators: I will say to NOT MY PEOPLE, THOU MY PEOPLE; and they shall say, MY GOD.

> 1 Peter 2:9,10&mdash; But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

### Verse 26

Here we see the Gentile people. God's infinite grace takes up those who were once called "dogs" (Matthew 15:26) and gives them a heavenly calling "Called to be children of the living God."

> Hosea 1:10-1&mdash;Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. 11 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

### Verse 27

Verse 27:	Here the apostle quotes another prophet, Isaiah. Isa. 10:22 - concerning a remnant.

> Isaiah 10:22 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.

"remnant" from 2641; a remainder, i.e. (by implication) a few:--remnant.

### Verse 28

The ways of God are not our ways. He waits long - He forbears - He is silent: then suddenly puts into execution an eternally formed purpose.

"Cut short in righteousness."

> Ezekiel 20:35,36&mdash;And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face. 36 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

- Cut it short - This word here means to "execute it speedily." The destruction shall not be delayed. (Hebrews 4:12 "cut")

### Verse 29

Verse 29:	This verse is a quote from Isaiah 1:9 shows that if God had not intervened by his grace, they would have all become as Sodom and Gomorrah.

> Isaiah 1:9&mdash;Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

> 2 Thessalonians 2:7&mdash; For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.
