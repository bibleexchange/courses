# The Servant Working

#### There is continuous, unbroken service of the servant recorded in this Gospel.  

###  And He did this - And He said that

- He taught men, they were in darkness
- He cheered men, they were without hope
- He healed men, they were sick and suffering
- He freed men, they were under the power of Satan
- He cleansed men, they are sinful

#### He called His disciples.

He selected 4 fishermen to become 4 fishers of men. They were to turn all the practical knowledge and skill over for God's use.

> Mark 1:18 &mdash; And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

Mark wrote the disciples &quot;straightway&quot; followed Christ. Too often we allow too much time between the call and our coming.

#### He worked with compassion.

Mark tells us Jesus&hellip;

- &hellip;took the little children in His arms

- &hellip;was grieved

- &hellip;sighed

- &hellip;loved

- &hellip;was angry

- &hellip;was touched with the feelings of our infirmities.

#### This is a Gospel of compassion.
