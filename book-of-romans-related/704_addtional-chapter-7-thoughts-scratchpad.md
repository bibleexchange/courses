 
I.	THE INNER STRUGGLE BEFORE DELIVERANCE
a.	TWO NATURES AT WAR AGAINST EACH OTHER
i.	THE OLD CARNAL NATURE      - 	IN THE FLESH
ii.	THE NEW NATURE OF CHRIST -  IN THE SPIRIT       
                                                                                                                                                                                                            Paul changes from the past tense in verses 7-13 to the present tense in verses 14-25.                                                             “I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said”
Ro 7:14—For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.                                             Paul speaks of his experience as a non-Christian under conviction in 7:7-13, learning that the law of God has been broken and there is deliverance through Jesus Christ, he now speaks of his experience as a non-Christian needing and wanting that deliverance.7:14-25 Most do not understand what is going on inside of them as a new born Christian.
Every True Born Again Christian has a Conscious experience of the Two Natures                                  Few Christians know of the True Doctrine of the Two Natures.                                                   There is much sorrow and discouragement that goes along with having an experience and not being able to fully understand it. For example the new convert is rejoicing in a new found personal experience with Jesus Christ as Saviour; he has turned from sin, the world and the devil and all its evil influences and is seeking to grow in peace love and joy when he is faced with the old forces of sin, fleshly desires and a deceitful heart.    (Jer.17:9)
Ro 7:18—For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.

b.	There is the nature of the flesh
Eph 2:3—Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
i.	The nature of the flesh comes by physical birth.
John 3:6—That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
ii.	This fleshly nature is called the old man.
Romans 6:6—Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.                                                                                           Eph 4:22—That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;                                                                                                   Col 3:9—Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
iii.	This fleshly nature is called the natural man
1Co 2:14—But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
iv.	This fleshly nature is called an enemy of God.                                                 James 4:4; I Jn. 2:15-17
Ro 8:7—Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. {the carnal...: Gr. the minding of the flesh}
v.	This fleshly nature has no good in it.                                                                                                 (it can&apos;st be changed or improved)                                Prov.17:20                          
Ro 7:18—For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
This is the spiritual struggle for every person under conviction that is ignorant of salvation but not ignorant of the law; the power of sin will always win over the flesh until deliverance and right doctrine to fight the fight of faith and take into captivity every negative thought that arises against the knowledge of God.          I Tim. 6:12; II Tim. 4:7                                                                                 2Co 10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)   5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;  6 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.


c.	There is the New Nature of Christ
i.	The New spiritual birth begins as a babe in Christ.                                           Mt. 18:3; Mr. 10:15; Ro. 6:4; 1Co. 3:2; 14:20 Heb. 5:13; I Pt.1:23; 2:1-2
ii.	The New born babe must be fed divine truth to grow.                                       Deut.8:3; Mat.4:4; Jer.15:16; Jn. 17:8; Gal.6:7-8; I Pt. 1:22,23
1 Peter  2:2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:
d.	The Divine law reveals our responsibility as a believer.
i.	The just shall live by faith. Hab. 2:4; Rom.1:17; Gal.2:20; 3:11; Heb.10:38
ii.	Fight the good fight of faith		I Tim. 1:18; 6:12; II Tim. 4:7
iii.	Put off the old man and put on the new man	Eph. 4:22-24
iv.	Have no confidence in the flesh.			Phil. 3:3; Rom. 7:6
v.	Make not provision for the flesh			Rom.13:14
vi.	The old nature is dead (Judicially)    		 Rom.6:6; Gal.2:20
vii.	We are to mortify the deeds of the flesh  	 Col. 3:5
Romans  6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

9.	Walk in the truth
10.	Walk with Him after the commandments
11.	Walk with Him in white
Paul begins by stating that the problem is not with the Law of God but with his own flesh (7:14-16). He then shows the problem is sin and not just weak flesh (7:17-23). Sin is evil “exceeding sinful” the flesh is weak.
Paul is describing his own personal struggle with sin before he understood deliverance


I.	The Conflict between the law and the sinner	          7:14-25

Why professing Christians struggle so.
They don&apos;st understand what the law of God is doing for them nor what the law of sin is doing to them.
Ro 7:1— Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?

1.	The Apostle Paul instructs brethren of how to deal with those still struggling in sin.

4—Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ&hellip;

●	14 “the law is spiritual” 16 “law&hellip;is good” 22 “I delight in the law of God&hellip; inward man”

2.	The Apostle Paul demonstrates the insufficiency of the law
a.	Those he was writing unto had been enlightened to the knowledge of God.
1,14,16,22
b.	  The unregenerate are still under the law.  14-24
i.	The saved are under Grace         6:14
ii.	The sinner is under the law         6:14
iii.	They approve of the law              7:14,16
iv.	Yet they serve sin &mdash; law has not the power to deliver  7:14

14  “I am carnal, sold under sin.” 17  “sin that dwelleth in me”
18  “I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing”&hellip;” how to perform that which is good I find not”
20  “sin that dwelleth in me”    21  “evil is present with me”
23  “the law of sin which is in my members”      24  “O wretched man that I am!”
25  “with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin”

Ro 7:25—I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

3.	 The Apostle Paul determines deliverance only through Jesus Christ
a.	Redemption is a work of Grace               
b.	Sin is universal an incurable corruption without the cleansing power of the blood of Jesus.
c.	There is no deliverance by the law.
d.	Deliverance is only through Jesus Christ our Lord



II.	The Conflict between the flesh and the law of sin.  7:23-25

The Battle Within
Romans 7:23—But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
The Battle is Won or Lost in the Mind
I.	The battle for the mind
a.	The devil is after your mind
i.	“warring against the law of my mind”
ii.	We can&apos;st win on our own we are in captivity to the law of sin without Christ.

2.	The Devil attacked Christ&apos;s mind—Christ won
b.	The devil is making prisoners
i.	“bringing me into captivity”
ii.	Without Jesus Christ all men are taken captive
1.	The devil takes advantage of you as you sin.
2.	The devil can&apos;st resist the Grace of God In your life.
c.	The devil battles through a sinful nature
i.	“the law of sin which is in my members”
ii.	You can&apos;st stop your sinning on your own.
1.	The devil is judged by the laws of God.
2.	The works of the devil are destroyed by the Grace of God.

Romans 7:24—O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
	The Body of this Death is our own corrupt self
II.	Delivered from sin unto Victorious living
a.	“O wretched man that I am”
i.	The Carnal Nature is as leaven
ii.	The old Nature is a Rebel
iii.	The self life is a tyrant
1.	An evil snare

ii.	The Course of the self life
1.	Discourage, deceive and destroy.
iii.	The Cure of the self life
1.	Must come to the realization you need deliverance and salvation.
2.	Must realize you can&apos;st deliver, nor save yourself.
The law can&apos;st save you.
3.	Only Jesus can save a soul from sin and deliver from carnality.

Why do God&apos;s laws arouse our sinful desires?

Romans 7:7-25

Because sin in us seizes the opportunity and becomes:

	A sharpshooter, picking the best times and places for a kill

	A magnet, creating an attraction as the object comes near

	A temptress, working seduction at the point of need

	A lawyer, trapping a victim in his won arguments

	An engineer, building elaborate traps

	An army, occupying undefended areas in our morality

	A guerrilla, instigating rebellion behind the scenes


The main theme of chapter seven is the believer&apos;s relation to the law.  The believer is united with Christ “the new husband.”  When we are born we are bound to the law like as a marriage.  To be free from the law, because the law will never die or change we must die.  We become dead to the law by the body of Christ, which allows us to marry him that is raised from the dead, Christ.  We are delivered from the law to serve God in the newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.  In the next section beginning in verse seven Paul shows that the believer is not made holy by the law.  The law shows how sinful the carnal nature is.  I became aware of sin when I became aware of the law.   The law is holy and good but sin worked death in me.  The last section shows the battle of the two natures.  In my spirit I can know what is good but my flesh will always fight against it.  The real struggle begins when are saved and have a desire to do well.  Our desire to do right can be overpowered by carnal nature if we allow sin in our lives.  Just having a desire to do good is not enough we need power to overcome the law of sin.  It is Jesus Christ who delivers us from the power of sin but we will always have a battle with our flesh.



What is your mind-set?  Your mind-set will determine how you act.  It will motivate you and influence who or what you will choose as a source of knowledge and authority.  It will affect a person view of your experiences and will shape your value system.  It will dominate your private and public life.

A sinful mind-set will bring death, with hostility toward God, and resistance to any form of submission.  It will also show actions and attitudes that will not please God.  “Let this mind be in you which is also in Christ Jesus “Phil. 2:5.

A spiritual mind-set will produce life and peace with God and man.  It will produce friendship with God.  There will be obedience to the Spirit&apos;s influence, being led by the Holy Spirit of God.  You will have a love of God and also your neighbor.  Knowing and following the word of God will be important in your life.


What is the Law?  The law was a  school master to lead us to Christ Jesus. Gal. 3:24-25.  The law was why the services of the sanctuary were performed.  If there were no sin, the need of a sacrifice would not be needed.  A transgression of the law therefore needed a sacrifice to pay the dept of sin.  Rev. 11:19  It states that John saw in his vision of the tabernacle of God in heaven, the law.    Heaven was the  place for safekeeping of the law of God Rev. 15:5.  

The city of David was the place that God has chosen to make his abode.  It contained the Temple of God.  Inside the temple was the Holy place and beyond the vail was the Holiest of Holies which held the ark, inside the ark was the tables of stone upon which God had written the Ten Commandments,  the oracles of God.  This was the law of God and was a revelation to men as to how God wanted man to act.  Without the law the temple services were without meaning.  The law being a reproduction of the perfection of God and his nature.  So what is so important in the Law and what is the law?  It is called the perfect law of liberty.   God&apos;s word says that the law has made me wiser than my enemies: for they are ever with me.   We are told to meditate on the Law of God....Ps.  119: 127, 129. 98, 99, 96.

Exodus 20; 24:12; 31:18.

The Ten Commandments were given to Moses on Mt. Sinai, and placed in the ark under the mercy seat.  Ex. 25:16,21.



The Ten Commandments are:

1.  “I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  Thou shalt have not other gods before Me.

2.  Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that despise (hate) Me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that show commitment to (love) Me, and keep My commandments.

3.  Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in unfruitful, empty, (vain); for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in uselessness (vain).

4.  Remember the sabbath  day, to keep it holy.  Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, not thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hollowed it.

End of God&apos;s statements about how we are to serve him.  Now he deals with how we are to treat others.

5.  Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord they God giveth thee.

6.  Thou shalt not kill.  Can I kill someones spirit, how could I do this?

7.  Thou shalt not commit adultery.   What do you consider adultery?

8.  Thou shalt not steal.  But I am only taking what is mine!

9.  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.   Who is my neighbor?

10.  Thou shalt not covet they neighbor&apos;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&apos;s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor&apos;s.  Ex. 20:2- 17.

It is impossible to have a civilization without these laws.

What are our duties to God?  They are explained in the first four commandments.    The last six commandments define what man is to do to his fellow men.  The two great commandments are to love God and also to love man.  Matthew 22:37-40


Romans 7:12  “The Law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”  (Eccl. 12:13)

Who are the people of God?     Spiritual Israel is anyone that is born again.  The law is the foundation of the government of God.    All who are born again must follow the rule of government, which is the law of God.  Does god change the law for men or men ideas of what is right and wrong?   He is not changed the law at all, but fulfilled the ritual law, and paid the price for our sins.
