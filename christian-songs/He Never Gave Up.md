# He Never Gave Up

## Chorus 

He never gave up, He never gave up 
Mercy reached down and that was enough. 
If you could see who I was before, then I'm sure you'll agree 
He never once, never gave up on me. 

## verse 1

Now it's been a long, long road. 
And my soul is grown so weary. 
I just can't understand all the struggles within me. 
There's been times I strayed away 
even times I could not pray. 
But somehow my faith would say just hold on there's a brighter day. 

## verse 2

If your back's against the wall 
and feel all hope is gone 
Have you often asked yourself is there reason to go on. 
But He looks beyond my guilty stains,
and His Mercy takes the blame. 
So forget about your past just praise The Lord you're free at last.
