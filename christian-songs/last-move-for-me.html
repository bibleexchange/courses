<h1>Last Move for Me</h1>

<h2>Verse 1</h2>
<p>
<span class='song-line'>I've been traveling for Jesus so much of my life</span>
<span class='song-line'>Been traveling o'er land and on sea</span>
<span class='song-line'>But I'm planning on taking a trip to the sky</span>
<span class='song-line'>That will be the last move for me</span>
</p>

<h2>Verse 2</h2>
<p>
<span class='song-line'>I've seen wonderful sights as I travelled afar</span>
<span class='song-line'>How little, how empty they seem</span>
<span class='song-line'>When I make my last move to that city of gold</span>
<span class='song-line'>That will be the last move for me</span>
</p>

<h2>Verse 3</h2>
<p>
<span class='song-line'>Here I'm bothered with packing each time that I move</span>
<span class='song-line'>And carry a load in each hand</span>
<span class='song-line'>But I'll not need one thing that I've used in this world</span>
<span class='song-line'>When I move to that heavenly land</span>
</p>

<h2>Verse 4</h2>
<p>
<span class='song-line'>Everything that I'll need will be furnished up there</span>
<span class='song-line'>Not even my song books I'll bring</span>
<span class='song-line'>Or the precious old Bible that showed me the way</span>
<span class='song-line'>I'll not need when I stand by my King
</span>
</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p>
<span class='song-line'>When I move to the sky up in heaven so high
</span>
<span class='song-line'>What a wonderful time that will be
</span>
<span class='song-line'>I'm ready to go washed in Calvary's flow
</span>
<span class='song-line'>That will be the last move for me
</span>
</p>
