# What the book of Proverbs says about families

## Advice to parents

### Provide for your family

> Proverbs 13:22&mdash;A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children:  
> And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.

> Proverbs 31:13–15&mdash;She seeketh wool, and flax,  
> And worketh willingly with her hands.  
> She is like the merchants’ ships;  
> She bringeth her food from afar.  
> She riseth also while it is yet night,  
> And giveth meat to her household,  
> And a portion to her maidens.

### Teach your children

> Proverbs 22:6&mdash;Train up a child in the way he should go:  
> And when he is old, he will not depart from it.

The book of Proverbs is an example to us. The book is written as a father instructing his son.

### Correct your children

> Proverbs 29:15&mdash;The rod and reproof give wisdom:  
> But a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.

If you love your children, you will correct them.

> Proverbs 13:24&mdash;He that spareth his rod hateth his son:  
> But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.

> Proverbs 19:18&mdash;Chasten thy son while there is hope,  
> And let not thy soul spare for his crying.

> Proverbs 23:13–14&mdash;Withhold not correction from the child:  
> For if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.  
> Thou shalt beat him with the rod,  
> And shalt deliver his soul from hell.

> Proverbs 29:17&mdash;Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest;  
> Yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.

See also Proverbs 22:15.

## Advice to children

### Respect your parents

> Proverbs 20:20&mdash;Whoso curseth his father or his mother,  
> His lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.

Many children do not respect their parents.

> Proverbs 30:11–14&mdash;There is a generation that curseth their father,  
> And doth not bless their mother.  
> There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,  
> And yet is not washed from their filthiness.  
> There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes!  
> And their eyelids are lifted up.  
> There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords,  
> And their jaw teeth as knives,  
> To devour the poor from off the earth,  
> And the needy from among men.

### Listen to your parents

> Proverbs 6:20–22&mdash;My son, keep thy father’s commandment,  
> And forsake not the law of thy mother:  
> Bind them continually upon thine heart,  
> And tie them about thy neck.  
> When thou goest, it shall lead thee;  
> When thou sleepest, it shall keep thee;  
> And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

> Proverbs 15:5&mdash;A fool despiseth his father’s instruction:  
> But he that regardeth reproof is prudent.

Your parents were once you age, and these are the things that they learned.

> Proverbs 4:1–4&mdash;Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father,  
> And attend to know understanding.  
> For I give you good doctrine,  
> Forsake ye not my law.  
> For I was my father’s son,  
> Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.  
> He taught me also, and said unto me,  
> Let thine heart retain my words:  
> Keep my commandments, and live.

See also Proverbs 1:8–9; 3:1–2; 13:1.

### Don't take advantage of your parents

> Proverbs 28:24&mdash;Whoso robbeth his father or his mother,  
> And saith, It is no transgression;  
> The same is the companion of a destroyer.

### Your choices can hurt your parents

> Proverbs 10:1&mdash;The proverbs of Solomon.  
> A wise son maketh a glad father:  
> But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

> Proverbs 19:26&mdash;He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother,  
> Is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

> Proverbs 28:7&mdash;Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son:  
> But he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.

See also Proverbs 15:20, 17:21, and 17:25.

### Or, if we are obedient, we will bless them

> Proverbs 23:22–25&mdash;Hearken unto thy father that begat thee,  
> And despise not thy mother when she is old.  
> Buy the truth, and sell it not;  
> Also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.  
> The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice:  
> And he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.  
> Thy father and thy mother shall be glad,  
> And she that bare thee shall rejoice.

> Proverbs 27:11&mdash;My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,  
> That I may answer him that reproacheth me.

> Proverbs 29:3&mdash;Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father:  
> But he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.

## Advice to the single

There are more verses in Proverbs that talk about single people than married people. This is because these words were originally written as a father to his son, who was probably young and unmarried.

We would be wise to teach these same words to our children. You may be married, but these words are still important because you can teach them to your children and grand children.

### It is a good thing to be married and have children

> Proverbs 17:6&mdash;Children’s children are the crown of old men;  
> And the glory of children are their fathers.

> Proverbs 31:10&mdash;Who can find a virtuous woman?  
> For her price is far above rubies.

> Proverbs 18:22&mdash;Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing,  
> And obtaineth favour of the LORD.

### But it can also be a bad thing

> Proverbs 17:1&mdash;Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith,  
> Than an house full of sacrifices with strife.

> Proverbs 19:13&mdash;A foolish son is the calamity of his father:  
> And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

> Proverbs 21:9&mdash;It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop,  
> Than with a brawling woman in a wide house.

> Proverbs 21:19&mdash;It is better to dwell in the wilderness,  
> Than with a contentious and an angry woman.

> Proverbs 25:24&mdash;It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,  
> Than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.

> Proverbs 27:15–16&mdash;A continual dropping in a very rainy day  
> And a contentious woman are alike.  
> Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind,  
> And the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

There's at least six verses in  Proverbs that warn about marrying the wrong person, but many times they are not emphasised. Instead we only talk about how "a man that findeth a wife findeth a good thing."

Why all these neegative verses only about a bad wife? What about bad husbands? Again, Proverbs was written to teach sons. It was warning them about who they should marry. We could assume that if the book was written to daughters, that there would be plenty of warnings against bad husbands.

### Be careful who you give your affection to

> Proverbs 5:1–4&mdash;My son, attend unto my wisdom,  
> And bow thine ear to my understanding:  
> That thou mayest regard discretion,  
> And that thy lips may keep knowledge.  
> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb,  
> And her mouth is smoother than oil:  
> But her end is bitter as wormwood,  
> Sharp as a twoedged sword.

Chapter 31 gives characteristics of a good wife. These are the things that we need to teach our children to look for in a potential spouse.

### Let God help you find a spouse

Some preachers will quote Proverbs 18:22 and say that we have to actively and dilligently search for a wife, but we have to remember that God is ultimately the one that will provide a good wife.

> Proverbs 19:14&mdash;House and riches are the inheritance of fathers:  
> And a prudent wife is from the LORD.
