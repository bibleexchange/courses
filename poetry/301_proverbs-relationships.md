# What Proverbs says about friendships

## Introduction: It is wise to have friends

> Proverbs 18:1&mdash;Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh  
> And intermeddleth with all wisdom.

The Hebrew word for _intermeddleth_ in the Hebrew is _gala_ (גָּלַע ), which means "to be hostile or to defy."[1] This means that the selfish man, who is seeking his own desires, is defying wisdom. Wisdom says that it is a good thing to have friends, but he is too selfish to share his time and resources with other people.

> No man is an island entire of itself; every man   
> is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;  
> if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe  
> is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as  
> well as any manner of thy friends or of thine  
> own were; any man's death diminishes me,  
> because I am involved in mankind.   
> And therefore never send to know for whom  
> the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.   
> &mdash;_John Donne_[2]

## It is better to have a few real friends than to have many shallow friends

Not everyone that says that they are your friend is a real friend. In Proverbs the Hebrew word _rea_ (רֵעַ ) can mean either a "neighbor" or a "friend."[3] We have to look at the context to see if the word means someone who is physically close (a neighbor) or someone who is emotionally close (a friend). In life we also have to discern who are real friends are. You can live near someone and see them every day, but that does not make them a true friend. Many people talk good to us. They say, "I am your friend," but will they be there when you really need them? A true friend is someone who is there in the good times and the bad times.

### A true friend never abandons you

> Proverbs 17:17&mdash;A friend loveth at all times,  
> And a brother is born for adversity.

There are two ways of interpreting this verse:

1. One way says that the friend is better than the brother. Bruce Waltke says that in this verse that "The friend is represented as always present, in good times and bad; the relative only in adversity."[4]
2. The other way is that the two lines show how both the friend and the brother show their love. Tremper Longman, III says "The relationship between the cola seems to be one of intensifying and particularizing, but not contrasting. That a friend loves all the time would include moments of adversity."[5]

Either way of interpreting it, the verse talks about how a friend is always there&mdash;no matter what.

Talk is cheap. Proverbs 20:6 says that "Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: But a faithful man who can find?" We need to be careful that we do not put our trust in unfaithful men, because if we do, we will be in trouble.

> Proverbs 25:19&mdash;Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble  
> Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.

### Some people will want to be your friend for the wrong reason

Some people call everyone their "friend," but do they really care about you? (Or do you even care about them?) A friend is more than someone that can give **you** good things, but you have to also **give to them** to make strong friendships.

When someone has money, then he will have many "friends," but when the money is gone, the friends will also be gone.

> Proverbs 19:4&mdash;Wealth maketh many friends;  
> But the poor is separated from his neighbour.

See also 14:20 and 19:6&ndash;7.

### Friends may be closer than family

> Proverbs 18:24&mdash;A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly:  
> And there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

> Proverbs 27:10&mdash;Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not;  
> Neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity:  
> For better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.

Does this mean that family is not important? No. Lindsay Wilson says about this verse that "This is not to minimize fraternal responsibilities, but rather to lift up the value of a friend or neighbour."[6]

### Choose your friends wisely because they can influence you

> Proverbs 13:20&mdash;He that walketh with wise men shall be wise:  
> But a companion of fools shall be destroyed.

The book of Proverbs was written as a father to his son, so there are many warnings to stay away from negative influences (1:10&ndash;19; 12:26; 13:20; 16:29; 20:19; 22:24&ndash;25; 28:7; 29:3).

Because bad relationships can be harmful to us, if we cannot find good friends, than it is better to be alone than to settle for bad friends&mdash;or a bad spouse! (17:1; 25:24)

## Wisdom teaches us how to be a good friend

### Handle matters with wisdom

> Proverbs 16:20&mdash;He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good:  
> And whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

### Be considerate of others

> Proverbs 27:14&mdash;He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,  
> It shall be counted a curse to him.

### Be willing to forgive

> Proverbs 10:12&mdash;Hatred stirreth up strifes:  
> But love covereth all sins.

### Don't meddle in other people's business

> Proverbs 26:17&mdash;He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him,  
> Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.

### Don't overstay your welcome

> Proverbs 25:17&mdash;Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house;  
> Lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.

Heaping coals...

!! Proverbs 25:21–22 (KJV 1900)
      21       If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat;
      And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
      22       For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
      And the LORD shall reward thee.

### Keep a right relationship with God

> Proverbs 16:7&mdash;When a man’s ways please the LORD,  
> He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.

## Sometimes even friends will disagree... and that's a good thing

### Counsel from friends is beneficial to us

> Proverbs 27:9&mdash;Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart:  
> So doth the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.

### Sometimes the counsel of friends will come in the form of correction

The wise person wants friends who will be honest with him. True friends will tell us the truth, even if it hurts.

> Proverbs 27:5–6&mdash;Open rebuke is better than secret love.  
> Faithful are the wounds of a friend;  
> But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.

> Proverbs 29:5&mdash;A man that flattereth his neighbour  
> Spreadeth a net for his feet.

### We may not like the correction at first, but later we will see the value of it

> Proverbs 28:23&mdash;He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour  
> Than he that flattereth with the tongue.

### This confrontation will help us mature

> Proverbs 27:17&mdash;Iron sharpeneth iron;  
> So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.

> This character-forming wisdom, rooted in God, is experienced in community. In studying sapiential [relating to wisdom] instruction, I have discovered the ubiquitous presence of conversation and conflict. Character development flourishes only in a community where healthy confrontation exists. Without the rigors of such an environment, individual character becomes undisciplined. The sages believed strongly in the principle that “iron sharpens iron” when it came to human interaction. Growth comes through struggle, and struggle is manifested as constructive conflict in healthy relationships.

## Conclusion

We need to work hard at keeping our relationships with our friends strong, because if we offend them, it may be impossible to restore that relationship.

> Proverbs 18:19&mdash;A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city:  
> And their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

The stronger the friendship, the greater the divide when offended. This is why some family feuds are so strong, and also why people who were once madly in love are now clamoring for a divorce. So we should take great care to fix problems with our closest friends when they are small.
