- Verses on prudence: Prov. 12:23; 14:8; 14:15; 15:5; 22:3

## 1. The Prudent Invest (vs. 1,2,6)

> Ecclesiastes 11:1,2,6 &mdash; 1 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.  ...  6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

THE COUNSEL: NOT HOARDING, BUT SOWING, careful investment

> Matthew 13:24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed **good seed** in his field: 25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 
26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 

- tares grow even when good seed is sown. did you not sow good seed in your field
Enemy sowing seed.
- Speak the Word - The Power in Speaking the Word
- Live the Word
- "CAST UPON THE WATERS"
- Invest in people, relationships
> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
Galatians 6:9

## 2. The Prudent Wisely Uses Opportunity (vs. 3)

> Ecclesiastes 11:3 &mdash; 3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

2 **Lessons**: From the Cloud=LIBERALITY; From the Trees=DEATH

## 3. The Prudent See Opposition Right (vs. 4)

> Ecclesiastes 11:4 &mdash; 4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

Regard the clouds = not reap

When the Seed is Good, the Time is Right

- don't listen to the wind
Upon the water - like when the  Nile overflowed it's Banks and you can't see where it will land. We can be over calculating

- morning vs evening, still sow
The barn, storehouse barren, wishing someone else has laid something up. Sow. EATING FROM GRANDPA'S GARDEN AS A CHILD, ONION
- don't die with seed in your hand (tree)

## 4. The Prudent Recognize the Sovereignty of God (vs. 5)

> Ecclesiastes 11:5 &mdash; 5 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

Uncertainty, so much we don't understand or know.

## The Prudent Prepares for Beyond His Youth, vs. 7-10

> 7 Â¶ Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: 8 But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity. 9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. 10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

- Keep Your End in View
- Don't Do just because you can. All evil desires, though now they seem good to thee. 
- "childhood and youth are vanity" - Don't rely on time, as it is fleeting. 
- Prepare. Lay up.
