## Introduction 

### What is a proverb?

A proverb uses as few words as possible to communicate truth.

A proverb is a form of poetry.

Proverbs are not law or promises (there are some thoughts in _Living Well_ about this and some in _Fear_). A law always applies, but the proverbs are like principles, which only work in the right time and situation.

As Cervantes, the 16th century novelist, put it, “Proverbs are short sentences, drawn from long experience.” from _Living Well_)

?? Does Proverbs promote prosperity gospel? (Or retribution theology)

The second chapter of _Interpreting Wisdom_ has good thoughts on character-consequence nexus.

Contradictions in Proverbs (answer a fool). They show that application is based on situations. _Fear_ pg. 132

Better-than proverbs. A form of parallelism.  

### Structure

#### Ch 1-9 longer discourses

Written by Solomon (1:1)

Tremper Longman divides this section into 17 lectures. See How to Read Proverbs pg. 
22 for list. Waltke gives only 14 (NICOT pg. 10)

Collection I: Title with Preamble (1:1–7), Prologue (1:1–8:36), and Epilogue (9:1–18) (NICOT)

##### Key themes in this section 

###### Path of life

There is a good way and a bad way.

There are snares and dangers in the way.

###### Woman wisdom

She speaks in Proverbs 1:20-33; Chapter 8.

She is mentioned in 9:1-6, 11. Also 2:3-4, 4:7-9, 6:22, 7:4.

Who is she?

>I believe that Woman Wisdom is a poetic personification of Yahweh's wisdom&mdash;_Fear_ pg. 27

* She keeps good friends
    * righteousness (8:6)
    * truth (8:7)
    * prudence (8:12)
    * common sense (8:14-15)
* She stays away from bad company 
     * deception
     * evil
     * pride
     * arrogance (8:7-8, 13)
* She was one of the first things created (8:22-26, 8:30-31, 3:19) ("...She, better than anyone, knows how the world works, and thus she is capable of helping us navigate life"&mdash;_Fear_ pg. 20)
* She does not tolerate rejection (1:24-27)

###### Woman Folly

Chapter 9:13-18

She is similar to the Strange Woman (5:8 and 7:22 are like 9:13-18. And 2:18-19, 5:5, and 7:27 are like 9:18)

Both women start by calling out to the simple (9:4, 16). Both desire a relationship (come in with me). Both have prepared a meal (9:1-2, 17). 

#### Ch 10-31 individual proverbs

7 divisions (1:1; 10:1; 22:17; 24:23; 25:1; 30:1; 31:1)

How many sayings?

Proverbs are context-sensitive. That means you need wisdom of when and where to apply them.

### Definition of wisdom

<!--This could possibly be moved to the introduction, so as to deal with the idea of wisdom for all 3 wisdom books. There could be a section here still about how wisdom directly applies to Proverbs.-->

Wisdom is applying knowledge to life. Just having knowledge is not enough (Proverbs 26:7, 9).

It is like emotional intelligence. _Fear_ pg. 10 begins a good introduction to this.

Longman in _fear_ gives 3 levels of wisdom:

1. Practical
2. Ethical (good)

In 1:3 it talks about the wise person receiving "righteousness, justice, and virtue."

> Throughout the book of Proverbs, righteousness and wisdom are interchangable terms. One cannot be wise without being righteous. In the same way, folly and wickedness are inextricably intertwined. Foolish behavior is evil.&mdash;_fear_ pg. 14

3. Spiritual

> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge&mdash;1:7

The rejection of wisdom begins with the rejection of God (Psalm 14:1) (_Fear_ pg. 16).

The first paragraph of Kidner’s commentary deals with the nuances of the type of wisdom covered in Proverbs.

Instruction, correction, and other related words. What do they mean?

### To whom was the book written?

#### Simple ones (1:4)

Neither wise nor foolish, but unformed. Immature. They do not know, but they are teachable.

#### Wise ones 

Mature. 

The writings will "increase learning" for them.

####  Not for fools (1:7)

They are excluded, or more correctly, they exclude themselves.

#### The son (1:8,10,15)

This is the actual person the book was originally written for.

This was common in writings at the time. See How to Read pg. 24.

Does this apply to women, or just to sons?

### Kinds of sayings

> Specifically, the following types of sayings are listed: maxims, proverbs, difficult sayings, words of the wise and enigmas. (How to read Proverbs, pg. 17)

> In spite of the quibbles over the exact meaning of these words, they all clearly represent Hebrew words that are difficult to understand not because they have a secret meaning or a code, but because they are forms of writing that address their subject indirectly rather than spelling it out in cold, factual language. (How to Read, pg. 17)
