# Chapter 6 (The vanity of long life.)

- A Long Life is Vain without the main ingredient of God's Gifts!

## The Gift of Contentment, vs. 1-2

- The ability to enjoy what we have is a gift from God.

> 1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: 2 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

- "evil": bad; natural or moral evil, wretchedness, wrong.
- "common among men" This is a reigning disposition.
- "God hath given riches"
- "yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof" To have everything he could need, but as a judgment of God for his ingratitude has a COVETOUS mind. (compare Luke 12:13-21)

> Luke 12:13-21 &mdash; And one of the crowd said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. 14And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? 15And he said unto them, Take heed and beware of all covetousness; for a manâ€™s life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses. 16And he spoke a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully; 17and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? 18And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my storehouses and build greater, and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. 19And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. 20But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast stored up? 21So is he that lays up treasure for himself and is not rich in God.

-"but a stranger eateth it" His mind is so covetous for MORE he does not appreciate nor enjoy what he has already.

> 1 Timothy 6:6 &mdash;  But godliness with contentment is great gain.

## The Gift of Rememberance, vs. 3,4

> 3 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he. 4 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.

- If we follow God's plan (Exodus; 20:12; Proverbs 22:6; Ephesians 6:1)
- God Keeps Good records. (Malachi 3:16; Revelation 20:12,15; Psalm 56:8; Hebrews 8:12; Matthew 10:30)

## The Gift of LIFE, vs. 5,6

> 5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other. 6 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?

- "do not all go to one place?"
- Nothingness? Forgottenness? the grave?

## The Gift of Satisfaction, v. 7

> 7 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.


## The Gift of "More and Better", vs. 8-11

> 8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? 

> &hellip; what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?

> 9 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

> 10 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: 

> neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.

> 11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?

## The Gift of Answers, v.12

> 12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
