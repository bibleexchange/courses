# Chapter 3: The Perplexity of Suffering

## Introductory Thoughts

### It is Poetic in Its Form

It is helpful to remember while studying the book of Job that it is a written in poetic form.  

Some repetition 

### It Confronki'
o9o-p-[-p[=
 >},kn;\'ts the Perplexity of Suffering

Job 3 begins to paint clearly Job's perplexity.

Oswald Chambers described Job as instruction in HOW to suffer.

The question of suffering is addressed - Why do we suffer?  Who or what causes it?  Why doesn't God do something?  Not all questions are answered, but some important points are made.

## Job Curses the Day of His Birth, vs. 1-19

Job wishes he never got a start.

> Job 3:1 ¶ After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 2 And Job spake, and said, 3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. 4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. 5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. 6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. 7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. 8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. 9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 11 ¶ Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? 12 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? 13 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, 14 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; 15 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 16 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. 17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. 18 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. 19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.

### Job cursed not God but he did curse the day he was conceived and the day he was born.

> Job 10:18,19 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.

### Job Has Alot to Learn

- To Teach What is Best

> Ps 69:30-33 … This also shall please the LORD better…

- To Teach Us that Only God Can Do Everything Right

> Job 42:2 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.                          

> II Cor. 6:16 God will dwell and walk in us

- To Teach Us How to Obey in All Things.

> Hebrews 5:8, 9 … yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
> 2 Cor. 2:9 … know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.
> 2 Cor. 10:5, 6 … into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; 
> Hebrews 12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; …

## Job Longs for Death, vs. 20-24

Job wishes for an end.

> 20 ¶ Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; 21 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; 22 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? 23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? 24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.

## Job Experiences His Fear Coming to Life, vs. 25-26

> Job 3:25&mdash;For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. 26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.

============================================
                                    
# Chapter 4: Eliphaz’s Answer to Job
Job 4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
Job 42:7 And it was so… the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite,  
When they got going Job wished they never started.   2:12-13   13:5
(it should be your wisdom just to be silent in times like this)

What did Eliphaz answer?
Job’s need?            Heart Soul  Mind
Job’s pain?
No       Job’s words.      4:4     Thy words
v. 2     Can we talk to you?
          Commune with thee?
          Without you being grieved?
Ps 69:26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. 
La 3:33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
V.4     Thy words have helped others.    ----    (words can help)
                                                                   Eph. 4:15   Speak the truth in love
v. 5     Trouble comes on you Job and you faint.
V.6    They thought Job to be a hypocrite     8:13    15:34     20:5
V.7     They thought trouble only effects the unrighteous.                
           Who ever perished being innocent?                                                                                                 
Remember the cross
Remember the Martyrs         The Apostle Paul  II Cor. 11:23-33    12:7-10
Remember Abel, Elijah, Jeremiah, 3 Hebrews, Daniel, Jn.The Baptist and John.
V. 8     “Even as I have seen”
            Personal experiences can be helpful  or blind you from a true need.
            No true feelings for his friend.     Quite insensitive      
            (Your reaping what you sowed)
9-11
Judgment may be gradual like the growing of a crop.
Judgment may be sudden like the wind 
or like an attack from a lion
1Jo 4:18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
12-21           An experience secretly brought to him by a spirit.
He heard a little thereof in his ear.   V. 12

We must stay conscious of who we are and what we are by constantly examining ourselves by the Word of God lest we become deceived.

True wisdom is learning the whole course of what life’s trials intend to teach.
Always maintain confidence in God and great expectations for deliverance from every trial.  Please let wisdom speak and everything else to be silent.


Personal experiences
Job 4:7-5:27
4:7 Praying or pleading to Job to remember something, rather than remembering to pray for Job
4:8     Even as I have seen
5:27   We have searched it out, so it is
4:7      Remember 
        
How many forget the Word of God and put their experiences above the Word of God.

5:8     I would seek unto God and unto God would I commit my cause.
But yet Eliphaz instead of praying he gives Job the history of a fool.(4:21; 5:2-5)

Job’s three friends spent more time trying to prove Job wrong rather than give him help.
5:2      Judging Job to be foolish and silly.
5:3-6  Judging Job as the cause of the death of his children.

Divine Chastening              Job 5:13    1 Cor. 3:19
Job 5:17 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
Pr 3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
 12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
Heb 12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
 6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
 Jas 1:12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
 Re 3:19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
   
We need to enter into a deeper experience of the things of God.
Experiences without a right understanding of the Word of God are DANGEROUS.
That’s why Jesus said take heed that ye be not deceived.
Mr 4:24 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.
Lu 8:18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.
Lu 21:8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. 
Ga 5:15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
 
Mt 6:1 ¶ Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. {alms: or, righteousness} 
 Mt 18:10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
 
Mt 4:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
 De 8:3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live..             (We need a Word from God.)                 
A True Friend
6:1-7:21

It will take a full revelation of the will of God to enable us to comprehend how to become A True Friend.        
Job 6:1 But Job answered and said,      
 Our prayer should be that God teach us the true need that we may minister comfort as a true friend.

Job 6:4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 
Job 6:23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
 
(It takes the pure Word of God to get you through these trials.)
(We must always understand our need for a word from God)

Job 6:14 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 
(The fear of God will help you to be a true friend)
Pr 17:17 ¶ A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.
Pr 18:24 ¶ A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
Pr 22:11 ¶ He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend.
Pr 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
Pr 27:9 ¶ Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.
Pr 27:10 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.
Pr 27:14 ¶ He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
Pr 27:17 ¶ Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
Jas 2:23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
Mt 11:19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.
Lu 7:34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
Jas 4:4 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

Jesus was not as they said a friend of the world but Jesus is a True Friend.

Job was in training of how to be patient as a true friend at all times.







A Deceitful Brook

Job 6:15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
Job’s friends didn’t feel the heaviness of his sufferings.
Job 6:2 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 
 3 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. {my words...: that is, I can’t find the words to express my grief}
Job nor his friends understood the purpose of the trial.
6:4 felt like a target 
6:5 like a starving animal, (Hungry for love and understanding.)  
6:8-13 Job felt hopeless.
6:15-21 Job’s friends were very disappointed in him.
6:20 Job’s friends become ashamed of him.
6:21 Job’s friends were afraid of him.     
 Ps 38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.  
Mr 9:32 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him. 
Lu 9:45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
Joh 6:60 ¶ Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?   
6:66 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
6:22-23  Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give…Deliver me…or, Redeem me?
Job‘s friends did come voluntarily unto him.
Job 6:25 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
6:26-30 Job’s friends tried to reprove rather than really pray. 
Physically they sat with him on an ash heap. Job 2:8,13
Emotionally they went to the other side of the road.  (Lk. 10:30-32)
The Good Samaritan was a true friend.

The Apostle Paul was a friend for life.
2Co 12:15 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

Job made three more requests.
Job 6:24 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: 
and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.                     .
Job 6:28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. 
Job 42:10 ¶ And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 
  ( “ Now” –right now is very important to me.)






When life becomes a burden

Job 7:20 … so that I am a burden to myself?

7:1 appointed time <tsaba'> Job is a man of war without retirement
hireling <sakiyr> hired man   Job is a workman without pay.
  
7:2 as a servant looking for the night

7:3-4 sleepless man looking for the day

7:5 a very sick man where life is moving swift but not enough.

7:6 when life is swifter than a weaver’s shuttle

7:7 or life becomes wind 

7:16 let me alone 

7:17 man focused

Jas 4:14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. 
       2Co 1:8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
 9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 
 10 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; 
      2Co 4:14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.
 15 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
 16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
 18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
        Eph 1:18-23 power to usward who believe.
Job 7:20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?  19x’s confessed throughout the scripture-
Ex:9:27; 10:16; Num 22:34; Jos7:20; 1Sam15:24,30; 26:21; 2Sa 12:13; (David)            2Sa 24:10,17; IChron21:8; Job7:20; 33:27; Ps41:4; Mic7:9; Mt 27:4; Lk15:8; 21





A Pure Hope

Job 8:2 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
Job 8:4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; 
Job 8:6 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
 Job 8:20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:

A pure Hope knows that God doesn’t need guarding but the conscience of man sure does.    

Job 8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?

Ro 3:26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

Ac 13:38 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
39 And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

Heb. 9:9-14 The law sprinkled, Christ purges or purifies.

Heb 8:6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.    
2Co 4:1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
 2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.        
1Th 2:3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
 4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
Job 8:8-10 there is much to learn Job from the voice of experience.
All these attacks are assuming Job’s guilt and leaving it to him to prove 
            his innocence.
8:11-19 There is something missing in your life Job.
8:13 Job must be a hypocrite without hope.
8:20 if you were perfect Job, God would help you.
Job 8:20 Cast down but not cast away.  Ps 37:24; 94:14
2Co 4:9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
Every guilty soul that will believe in Jesus Christ for forgiveness shall be justified in all things.
Ps 42:5, 11; 43:5; 78:7; Rom. 15:8, 13 Pure Hope in Jesus Christ





A Day’s man

Job 9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. {daysman: or, mediator}
1Ti 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
1Jo 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:
 2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
 1Co 11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
 
Job 9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
Job 9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.  
Job 9:3, 4  If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
Job 10:2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. 
Job 9:16 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
Job 9:22 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.

Job 9:27-29 If I try to be happy what good will it do?

Job 9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.
 If I only had a Mediator

Job 16:21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour! 

We have a whole lot more than what Job was asking for.
Jesus Christ is our Daysman and more.

Jn.14:6-11, 16-20, 26; 15:26; 16:7-16   Heb.4:14-15

A better understanding of the whole Godhead.
Mediator, comforter and Great High Priest
Another Comforter
John 14:16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;













A Deliverer and Judge

Job 10:7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. 
Job 10:1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. {weary...: or, cut off while I live}
Job 10:2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
Job 10:3 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 
It is (good unto thee) that we praise you just the same.
Job 1:21 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
Jg 20:22    1Sa 30:6   2Ki 4:26 It is well. 
Ro 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
1Co 11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. 
Mt 12:20. Isa 42:3 Isa 42:4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged
Frame your conscience according to the Word of God and the Spirit of God not according to your passions.       Eph. 6:17 the Sword of the Spirit.
Job 10:15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;
 Job 10:21-22 A land of darkness                 .Mt 4:16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
I know you’re my Deliverer and Judge I just can’t see it.
Job 10:12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
But now Job was weary, bitter and confused.
 13 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.
Job 10:1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

V.14 A complete record of my sin without acquittal.
V.15Job along with his friends is viewing his afflictions as God’s disfavor.----------I am full of confusion---wounded conscience and spirit.  Prov. 18:14
V.16 lion v.17 war v.  22 light is as darkness
When the dagger is left in the soul the question is v.18
Job 10:17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
                                       





For He knoweth
The Lord knows and He has spoken

Job 11:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
 2 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified? 
 3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

 v. 14 Iniquity…Put it far away
Job 11:15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
Isa 1:16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
 17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. 
 18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.                        
19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
 1Co 2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
 10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
 11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
2Pe 1:3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: 
 Joh 14:26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.                                   Heb.1:1 God has spoken        I Pt. 5:10 
Job 11:5 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;                                  
                                                         









God is Sovereign

Job 12:1 And Job answered and said,
 2 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
 3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 
V.4 I am as one mocked of his neighbor. Jer. 33:3; Mic. 7:7
V5 Ready to slip    Psa. 73:2; Heb.3:1      As a lamp despised
V.6  If God is destroying me for my wickedness, why do the wicked prosper?
Job 12:11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 
6:30;34:3
12 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
 13 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. 

Job 12:16 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
14-25 (The Sovereignty of God is over all nations as well as individual lives.)

Ps 22:28 For the kingdom is the LORD'S: and he is the governor among the nations.
Ps 93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
 Re 11:15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
 Eph 1:8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
  9 Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:
 10 That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: 
 Da 4:35 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
 Eph 3:11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
 1Co 1:19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

Job 12:17 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.   Job 9:22; Mat. 10:26; 1Cor. 3:13; 4:5; 1Pt. 1:7; 4:12                  
                               God has something better in mind then we could plan.
Job 12:9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
 Job 1:21 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
Ex 6:3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.
 Job 12:23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again. 
                                 





Job’s confidence in God’s storm of suffering

Job 13:2 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.    
Job 13:1-12
Job holds to his integrity while disappointed with theirs.
Forgers of lies    
Physicians of no value.
Your wisdom is to be quiet.
 Reluctant listeners.
 Deceitful defenders of God.
 Mockers
 Respecters of persons
 His dread fall upon you.
 Your fame will come to nothing.
Job 13:13-16
Job holds to the Grace of God with confidence.

                           {maintain: Heb. prove, or, argue} 
	Statements of weak faith

v. 11 “His Excellency 
Job 13:11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?    
  
v. 23 “my sin”
24-28  thine enemy, a leaf driven to and fro, dry stubble, youthful lusts, feet in stocks,
Print upon my heels (deep sores) and as a rotten thing (a decaying body). 

Job 13:20 only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
More pain
More dread
Job 13:21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
 How many have felt like it was the hand of God against them?
Ru 1:13 for it grieveth me much…that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me. 


                                                    A living Hope

Job 14:1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. 
 2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
Job 14:14 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
 Job 14:19 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. 

The Hope of Resurrection life
Job 14:7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
 Job 14:13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!.

Joh 11:25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
 26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
Lu 7:14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
Lu 8:52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.
 53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
 54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.
 55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.
1Pe 1:3 ¶ Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,   
1Pe 1:13 ¶ Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;  
 1Pe 1:21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.
 1Pe 3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:  
 1Jo 3:3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
Heb 3:6 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
 Heb 6:11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
2Co 1:7 ¶ And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
     Tit 2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, 
                                                            







What is Man?

Job 7:17 ¶ What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?

Job 15:1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
Job 15:14 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

 Ps 8:4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest 
him?
 Ps 144:3 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
Heb 2:6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?

Job 14:1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. 

Job 13:28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.

The Tongue and Temper

Job 16:1 Then Job answered and said,
 2 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all. 
1Pe 1:2 “Elect …of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.”
Sometimes we have to experience misunderstandings from unsympathetic friends before we can learn how to minister to others the truth the way the Lord wants you to.
True comfort comes through sincerity, sympathy and sanctification.
Job 16:3 “vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest”?
Ga 5:23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
1Co 13:7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
Eph 4:2 “all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love”
1Pe 2:20 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. 
2:21 “called…Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example… follow his steps:” 
There is a close connection between the tongue and the temper.
It is hard to be a comfort to others if your heart is full of coldness and bitterness.
It is equally hard if your heart is enflamed with rage and anger.
Ga 4:18 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.
Pr 19:11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
2Co 12:20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
Php 2:12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
 13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
 14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
 15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; 
 16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
 17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with















The Omniscience of God

Job 24:1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
Jeremiah-The weeping prophet
Jer 9:1 ¶ Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
Jer 31:16 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
I. Jer. 12:1 The Righteousness of God
Job 12:4 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.
 5 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
 6  The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
Habakuk-The prophet of faith
Hab 2:3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
 4 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.
II. Hab. 1:12,13 The Holiness of God
Hab 1:1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
 2 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!
 3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.
Asaph-David-A man after God’s own heart
Ps 73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
III. Psa. 73:1 The Goodness of God
Ps 73:1 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart. 
IV. Psa. 2:4 The Laughing of the Lord
Ps 37:13 The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
Though this is a mystery of Providence, yet there is a reason for it, and we shall shortly know why the judgment is deferred; even the wisest, and those who know God best, do not yet see it. God will exercise their faith and patience, and excite their prayers for the coming of his kingdom, for which they are to cry day and night to him, Lu 18:7
2Co 1:9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:
God would have the righteous see hurting people not just problem people.24:2-17; 22:29
→Job 24:12 “the soul of the wounded crieth out”←22 (He draweth) no man is sure of life






God’s Dominion

Job 25:2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.
This last attack on Job is a reminder of the War in Heaven against the overcomer in 
Re 12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
 8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
 9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
 10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
 11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.


Mt 28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
1Pe 4:11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
Jude 1:25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

Job 25:4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?

Ro 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
Ro 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
Ro 5:21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Eph 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.
10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. 

Tit 3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
Tit 3:7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.






Living on the Edge

Job 26:14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

6 questions to examine your life with, am I living on the edge?
	1. How hast thou helped him that is without power?
	2. How savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
	3. How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom?
            4. Hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
	5. To whom hast thou uttered words?
	6. Whose spirit came from thee?
	
Lo, these are parts of his ways:
Parts (only the extreme boundaries of visible evidence)
V.5  Dead things are formed from under the waters
V.6 Hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering.
V.7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
V.8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
Heb. 1:3 upholding all things by the word of his power,
                      Ps 33:6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the                                                  
                      host of them by the breath of his mouth.
v. 9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.         Ex 20:21; 33:20-23; 34:3; Ps 97:2; Hab 3:3-5; 1Ti 6:16
1Ki 8:12 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
V.10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. (set the boundaries of the waters as well as light and dark)
V.11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.        Psa. 18:7; 104:7, 32; Hab. 3:10, 11; Na. 1:5; Ex 14:22; Jos. 3:16;               Ps 77:17, 18; 114:4.
V.12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
V.13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.    * The crooked serpent. Ps 74:13,14; Isa 27:1; Re 12:9
           
How little a portion is heard of him?
Parts (only the extreme boundaries of visible evidence) and how faint is the whisper that we hear of Him!  Ex.3:3-6; Eze 3:12; Re 1:10; Isa 30:21;Da 10:7; Ac 9:7 Ac 22:9; Ac 26:13-19; I Sam. 3:3-21; Is. 6:8; Jer. 6:16; Amos 7:14-15
1Ki 19:12 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.

The thunder of his power who can understand?
         Mat. 27:46     1Co 13:9, 10, 12      Psa. 29:3-9    Heb. 1:1-2; 3:7,15  Jn.7:37-38; 18:6 






Job’s Parable

v. 6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.

      3. Job 1:8; 2:3
A conscience void of offence.

Ac 23:1 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
Ac 24:16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.
 1Co 4:4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. {know: or, I am not conscious of any fault}
 2Ti 1:3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
 1Jo 3:20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.

Job 28:12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
Job 28:20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
Job 28:23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
Job 28:28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

Job 28:12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
Wisdom is Character.

God is Holy- Ps 99:9  “for the LORD our God is holy.”
God is love.- 1Jo 4:8; 16  “God is love”
God is light.- 1Jo 1:5   “God is light”
God is wisdom.- Ro 16:27 To God only wise, 
1Tim. 1:17 the only wise God;   Jude 1:25 To the only wise God
Ro 11:33 ¶ O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of  
God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
1 Cor. 1:24 “Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.”
1Co 1:30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
Eph 1:8 Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
Job received of God’s wisdom.-1:1, 8; 2:3
We need to receive and keep on receiving the Wisdom of God.

Ac 6:3; 1Co 2:13; 1Pe 1:15, 16; 1Co 3:17;  Jas 3:13;             

It is not enough to have knowledge only we need the Wisdom of God.
                        Pr 1:7; Pr 14:7; Pr 19:27; Pr 20:15; Pr 23:12; Pr 24:5 
	
There are three major parts to one step of faith toward wisdom.

The first part to true wisdom is having a reverent, respectful and humble attitude toward God.
                        Pr 1:7; Ps 111:10; Pr 9:10; Ec 12:13; De 10:12 

The second part is to have a humble attitude toward others and your own self.
                        Pr 11:2; Mic 6:8; Ge 18:19 

The third part is to ask God for Wisdom.
                        Jas 1:5; 1Ki 3:9 -12; Mat. 7:7, 8; 21:22; Mk. 11:24;  Jn.15:7;  I Jn. 5:14-15
              
Wisdom is brought forth to light only through Christ.  Job 28:11; Eph.3:9-10
2 Cor. 2:14, 17





The Cause of God has not Changed
Job 29:1-25

We should give more attention to the cause of God than anything else.
The true cause is not always what we are fighting but what we are fighting for.
Job 29:16 …”the cause which I knew not I searched out.”
Job 29:2 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
 3 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; 
 4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
 5 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;

De 8:2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.
 3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.
 4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.
 5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.
 6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.

The cause (of our past experiences) serves only as a rudder to direct us to trust God again rather than an anchor to hold us to the past.

Ps 77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.

One of the most difficult chapters in your life is how to grow old gracefully.
All that he valued seemed to be gone forever.
The great joy and blessings of the past.  1-6
The great joy and respect from others.    7-11
The great joy and ministry to others.       12-17
The great joy and hope of a future.          18-20
The great joy and comfort for all.             21-25
Ac 4:36 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation, an encourager) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,
 Job 29:25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
He was a leader who helped many people make wise decisions to come out or to avoid going into bad situations just by understanding and choosing God’s cause.







Face Reality Honestly

Face Reality Honestly that we cannot redeem ourselves for time or Eternity.
Job 30:1 ¶ But now they that are younger than I have me in derision whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
Job 30:9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
Job 30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.

They have rejected me and they have thrown off all restraint.

Job 30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

Job is confronted with nothing but suffering and rejection.

Job 30:17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
Mt 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Lu 22:44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
2Co 1:9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 

We must see the rejection of Job as a type of Christ, who was thus made a reproach of men and despised of the people (Ps 22:1, 6; Isa 53:3-5; 10-12; Heb12:2-3), and who hid not his face from shame and spitting, but bore the indignity better than Job did and far better than we have but we pray that the Lord really help us now that we see the reality of rejection and suffering like this.
Job 19:13-14, 19; Prov. 19:7; Mat. 26:56, 67; 27:30; Rom. 8:31-39
Job 30:10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
Job 19:19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. 
Ps 88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
Zec 11:8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. 
Job 42:6 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
Lk. 21:28, 36
Ac 5:41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
We can only find our spiritual rest in Christ.
Heb 4:9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. 
      Heb 3:19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
Eph 1:7; Col 1:1; Heb 9:12 – Redemption is through the blood of Jesus.
Rev. 3:21 – Rejection is something we must all learn to overcome.
Nu 12:14; De 25:9; Isa 50:6; Mt 26:67; 27:30; Ruth 4:6-8






                                    Job’s Final Appeal

Job 31:1. I made a covenant with mine eyes     40    … “The words of Job are ended.”
Job 31:2 For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the           Almighty from on high?   Past-Job 20:29; 27:13; 
Job 31:4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
Job 31:6 Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity. 
Job 31:35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. 
 36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
 37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
Job 31:35   (What is keeping me from hearing from God?)     Remember-Dan.10:10-21
     1.  v.  5  If I have walked with vanity
     2.  v.  5  if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
     3.  v.  7  If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes,
     4.  v.  7  if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
     5.  v.  9  If mine heart have been deceived by a woman
     6.  v.  9   if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
     7.  v.13  If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they  
                   contended with me;
      8.  v.16  If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the      
                    widow to fail;
              17  Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten    
                     thereof;
       9.   v.19  If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
      10.  v. 20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece    
                      Of my sheep
 v. 21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the    
                gate.
v, 24  If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my  
                      confidence;
v. 25 If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand   
 v.26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
 v.29 If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when 
               evil found him:
 v.31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot   
               be satisfied.
 v,33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my   
               bosom:
1Co 10:11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
GOD-WILL-PROTECT-AND-PROVIDE-WHEN-ALL-ELSE-OPPOSES.
2Co 13:5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?     Mat.4:1-11; Lk.4:1-14; Col 3:16; 1Jo 2:14; 1Th 1:5; 2:13; 2Th 2:17
Always remember it is God that is purifying your faith while under satanic attack.

The Best Days are Now

Job 32:7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
	      (Meaning, the ancient, who have experience should be able to teach wisdom.)
      Job 32:9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand   
      judgment.
	
Elihu had been a good listener.
Job 32:4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. 
Job 32:11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 
12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)

The voice of Elihu             A Forerunner (32:2; 40:8)36:2;(32:3;42:7)

Job 32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 
10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
 2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 
 3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.

Job 32:8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.

Job 32:18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. {matter: Heb. words} 

The voice of yesterday. -I am gone, but learn of me.
The voice of today. ----I am at your service, use me.
The voice of tomorrow.  -----don’t worry, trust God.

                  Heb. 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
Heb 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
Isa 1:18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.










God is Gracious

Job 33:24 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. 
This is new insight that is given, that God permits suffering so to keep us from sin.                                         Job 33:17
Ge 20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
Tit 2:14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

2Co 12:7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
 8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
 9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.

Job 33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
 32 If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
 33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.

God has provided a Ransom.                                         Job33:24

Mt 20:28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
 Mr 10:45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
 1Ti 2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

God makes new creatures.                    II Cor. 5:17       Job 33:4

Job 33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: 

God answers prayer.                              Ps 50:15            

Job 33:26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.

God delivers                                           Isa 38:17

Job 33:28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.





Have Faith only in God’s Word

(Ro 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.)
It is wise to only know and do God’s Word.
Job 34:2 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
 3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.    6:30; 12:11
 4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
Job 34:10 Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 
Job 34:16 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
Job 34:34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
Job 34:33 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. 
God does not want your counsel He wants your faith in His Word.
God does not cause problems He sends His word to save and to heal.Ps107:20
Choose what part thou wilt take, to humble thyself under the mighty hand of God, or choose your own Judgment.          Jam. 4:10; 1Pt. 5:6
Jer 13:18 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory. 
Let us then seek help from Him who is mighty to save.
“Speak, what thou knowest”
God’s Word

Job 34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
Job 34:25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.

Job 33:26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.

Job 34:7-9; Psa. 1:1    Steps that lead to fellowship with the world end in death 34:22
Same course of argument in reasoning, tolerating, offending and judging.
A Common cause with the wicked is always dangerous.
We take no part in unbelief or any ungodly view.

Songs in the Night

Job 35:10 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
Afflictions are sent to direct and quicken us to enquire early after God for His mercy.

Job 34:28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
Ps 78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
Ps 22:24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.

Ps 119:67 ¶ Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.

35:2 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
(But God thou canst neither hurt nor profit.)

35:9 ¶ By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job complains That God did not regard the cry of the oppressed against their oppressors.
24:12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them. 
35:12 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
           (Pr 1:25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:)
            Pr 1:28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me    
            early, but they shall not find me:
35:10 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
Jas 4:3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. 
Ho 7:14 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me. 
35:14 ¶ Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
Job 23:8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: 9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:

Ps 51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
Song 3:8 “They all hold swords, being expert in war: … because of fear in the night.”

Job 36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know Him not, neither can the number of His years be searched out.

Job 36:10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
  Whom God chastens he teaches, and the affliction makes people willing to learn, softens the wax, that it may receive the impression of the seal; yet it does not do this of itself, but the grace of God working with Truth.        Ps 94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;         Ps 51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
 Lu 11:39 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
14 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. {unclean: or sodomites}
The Preaching of the Cross is for the Salvation of the world as well as a Revelation of the Wrath of God.   Job 36:8-13; 15-18;      (21)      choose      Obedience through suffering.
15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.

Describing the Storm

Job 37:12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.
13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. 
23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
Without a cause,  or reason or Improperly Gen. 6-8; Ex.9:13-26; 1Sam.12;16-19

---Job 8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?

Choose to be a monument of his mercy, rather than just a monument of his justice.
Job 37:5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.             Eph 3:17-20    Job 37:13( He causeth it to come for…mercy)

The Lord is the Answer

Job 38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Ex 19:16,18; 33:9-11; 19-23; 1Ki 19:11; Eze 1:4; Heb 12:18-19,21; Re 1:10; 4:1,5; 8:5; 11:19 
2 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
Isa. 1:18 Come now let us reason together        ( Job 39:17)
Seeking out the secret counsel of God by man's reason alone, makes it more obscure, and shows his own folly. We need God’s help from beginning to Eternity.
Unsearchable – (not searched out, inscrutable - impenetrable)
Job 5:9 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number: 
Past finding out –( not tracked out, untraceable)
Job 9:10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. 
Ps145:3 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. 
Ro 11:33  O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
Pr 25:3 The heaven for height… is unsearchable. Eph 3:8…unsearchable riches of Christ; 
God is Job's Vindicator, but must first bring him to a true state of mind for receiving help.

Being Prepared not just Preparing

3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. 
Gird.

 7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
 8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. 
 9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.
 10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.                          ----Job 38:36----         Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
Eph 3:18 (able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth length depth and height)
Knowing The Time
Job 39:1 ¶ Knowest thou the time…
Ro 13:11 ¶ And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
1Co 15:34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.
 2Co 5:11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
Mt 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.

Mr 4:11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:
1Co 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
The Lord shows Job what little knowledge he had of the untamed creatures that run wild in the deserts and live at large, but are in the daily care of the Divine Providence of God. 
   I. Concerning the wild goats and hinds, Job 39:1-4.

1Th 5:1 But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
 2 For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.   3 For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.   4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.   5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.  6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.   7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.   8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.   9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,    Job 39:29 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.

4 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.

Unlimited power and infinite wisdom.
            Ge 18:14; Jer 32:17; Mt 19:26; Mr 10:27; 14:36; Lu 18:27
Job 42:3 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
Job’s greatest blessing was knowing the Lord better. (understanding more)
Job 42:5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.

Revival of Repentance
Job 42:7 ¶ And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
(a) You took in hand an evil cause, in that you condemned him by his outward afflictions, and not comforted him with my mercies. 
(b) You had a good cause, but handled it evil.

Job 42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
God’s Mercy produces Patience (so be patient)  -  I Thes. 5:14;  James 5:7,10-11
“The Lord also accepted Job”, and his friends in answer to his prayer. He accepted Job for them; also he has made us accepted in the beloved, Eph 1:6. Job did not say I told you so, upon the testimony God had given concerning him, and the submission they were told to make to him; but, God being graciously reconciled to him, he was easily reconciled to them, and then God accepted him. This is that which we should aim at in all our prayers and services, to be accepted of the Lord; this must be the height of our ambition, not to have praise of men, but to please God and defeat the devil.
Job 42:10 ¶ And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.   v.12 more than his beginning.
The Bands of Captivity have been broken
The worst captivity is a captivity of pride, because you love your life and have no desire to Change.                   (True faith is defined as Obedience)
The greatest Graces are obtained and maintained through humility, faith and patience.

Mr 11:24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.
Joh 16:26 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:          (I don’t have to keep telling you)    Heb 7:25
27 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
29 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. 
30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
* Obedience is better than sacrifice-I Sam.16:22 “Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice”
  
Job 42:10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
Deut. 30:1-3
Ps14:1-7
Ps126:1-6

De 5:29 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!

Joh 14:21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
 
Joh 14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.
 16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;

Re 22:14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

Obedience is keeping His commandments
Obedience to thee whole Counsel of God
Obedience is love
Fulfilling every command

The Spirit of obedience is the essence of love - the spirit of rebellion is the essence of sin

James 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
Acts 20:27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

2Co 2:9 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.       
The Spirit that prompts you to obey-yield      






The spirit that tempts you to disobey don’t yield to.

    III. Obedience can ask boldly at the Throne of Grace

Heb 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

Joh 14:23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

A life full of Obedience   
Conforming to God’s Will   
Showing the fruit of Righteousness to perfection in all things at all times

Holy Ghost reproves sin 
                   Condemns disobedience
Joh 16:8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
                   1Ti 2:8 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.
