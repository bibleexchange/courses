# Folly and wisdom (chapter 10)
# Ujinga na hekima (sura ya 10)

## Folly disgraces (v. 1–7)
## Ujinga wa aibu (mst. 1-7)

### Folly disgraces a wise man's honor (v. 1)
### Upumbavu haba ni mzito kuliko hekim a na heshima (mst. 1)

This is an obvious statement: dead flies spoils the perfume. Compare it with 9:18, which says "...one sinner destroyeth much good." So does a little folly to one respected for wisdom and honor.Hii ni taarifa dhahiri:nzi waliokufa huharibu marashi. Linganisha na 9:18, inayosema "…Mkosaji mmoja huharibu mema mengi. "Hivyo basi mjinga mmoja anayeheshimiwa kwaajili ya hekima na heshima.

### Folly disgraces the fool by revealing itself (v. 2–3)
###Ujinga humuaibisha mjinga kwa kujifunua yenyewe (mst. 2-3)

The right hand was regarded as the side of strength, skill, good and favor and the left hand was regarded as weak and bad. "To have one's heart at his left side is to have the 'springs of life' (Proverbs 4:23) located in the realm of practical and spiritual incompetence."[1] He shows everyone that he is a fool.Mkono wa kulia ulihusishwa kama upande wenye nguvu, ujuzi, uzuri na kibali na mkono wa kushoto ulihusishwa kuwa mdhaifu na mbaya. "Kuwa na moyo wa mtu katika mkono wake wa kushoto ni kuwa na "chemchemi za uzima" (Mithali 4:23) inayopatikana katika ulimwengu wa vitendo na uzembe kiroho. "[1]anamuonesha kila mtu kwamba ni mjinga.

### Folly disgraces in high places (v. 4–7)
### Ujinga wa aibu katika maeneo ya juu (mst. 4-7)

Folly is set in great dignity. Some lowly men are unwisely exalted (servants on horses). Foolish men are promoted or accepted to positions of great leadership, while some noblemen are humbled (princes walk on the ground like servants).Ujinga unawekwa katika heshima kuu.Baadhi ya wanaume wanyenyekevu ni hawainuliwi (watumwa katika farasi). wanaume wajinga wanakuzwa au kukubaliwa katika nafasi za uongozi wa juu, wakati baadhi ya wanaume wazuri wananyenyekewa (malkia hutembea katika ardhi kama mtumishi).

## Evidence of folly and wisdom (v. 8–20)
## ushahidi wa ujinga na Hekima (mst. 8-20)

### Foolishness in action (v. 8–10)
### Ujinga katika vitendo (mst. 8-10)

The fool doesn't wisely consider the future, but wise use of one's time in the present can make for a much better future.Mjinga haangalii wakati ujao, lakini mwenye hekima hutumia muda wa sasa kutengeneza wakati bora ujao.

### The babbling talk of the foolish (v. 11–14)
### Maongezi ya haraka ya mjinga (mst. 11-14)

The fool is known by his many words, and by his presumption about the future when no man knows what is to be. Previously Qohelet had confidently stated that there is nothing beyond this life, and that this life should be lived with an under the sun premise. He now casts more doubt upon that premise.Mjinga hujulikana kwa maneno yake mengi, na kwa dhana yake kuhusu kesho wakati hakina mtu anayejua kitakachokua.Katika wakati uliopita Koheleti  alisema kwa ujasiri kwamba hakuna chochote zaidi ya maisha haya, na maisha haya tuyaishiyo chini ya nguzo ya jua.Sasa anatupa mashaka dhidi ya nguzo.

### The fool at work (v. 15)
### Ujinga kazini (mst. 15)

Fools have no desire to work, or when they do work they quickly become wearied. They can't see that it is wise to work now in order to prepare for the future. The fool works hard to get out of work. Wajinga hawana hamu na kazi, au wakifanya kazi  wanachoka mapema.Hawaoni kwamba ni hekima kufanya kazi sasa ili kuiandaa kesho. Kazi za ujinga zinatakiwa ziwe mbali na kazi.

They do not even know how to go to the city! The fool has no sense of direction or goal. They live their life as if it were meaningless, directionless. "In a fine note of sarcasm, this proverb says that a person may be so involved in arguing about the universe that he misses what the ordinary person is concerned about, namely, finding the way home."[2] Hawajui hata namna ya kwenda katika jiji! Mjinga hana maana ya uelekeo au lengo. Wanaishi maisha yao kama vile ilikuwa haina maana, wala muelekeo. "Ktika maandishi ya kejeli, mithali hii inasema kwamba mtu anaweza kujihusisha katika mabishano kuhusu ulimwengu kuwa anakosa kile mtu wa kawaida anakionea wasiwasi kuhusu, yaani, kutafuta njia ya nyumbani."[2]

### How foolishness corrupts a nation (v. 16–20)
### Jinsi ujinga unavyoharibu taifa (mst. 16-20)

Qohelet understood that a land was blessed by good, faithful leaders, but cursed under wicked and incompetent leaders. If Ecclesiastes 10:18 symbolizes the fall of a nation, then the following reasons give the reason for the fall: leaders who are foolish, selfish, and concerned only for their own pleasure and good. "They do nothing in order; turn night into day, and day into night; sleep when they should wake, and wake when they should sleep; attending more to chamberings and banquetings, than to the concerns of the state."[3]Koheleti alielewa kuwa ardhi ilibarikiwa vitu vizuri, kiongozi mwaminifu lakini aliyelaaniwa chini ya uovu na kiongozi asiye na umahiri.Kama mhubiri 10:18 inaonyesha anguko la taifa, halafu sababu zifuatazo zinatoa sababu za anguko:Viongozi wajinga, wabinafsi na wanaojali mapenzi yao tu na mazuri yao. "hawafanyi chochote kubadili usiku kuwa mchana, na mchana kuwa usiku;wanalala wakati wanatakiwa kuamka, na huamka wakiwa wanatakiwa kulala; wakihangaikia ufisadi na karamu, badala ya maslahi ya nchi."[3]
