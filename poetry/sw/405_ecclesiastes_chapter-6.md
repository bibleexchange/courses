# The vanity of long life (chapter 6)
# Ubatili wa maisha marefu (sura ya 6)

## Some cannot enjoy their profit (v. 1–2)
## Baadhi hawafurahii faida zao (mst. 1-2)

Qohelet now continues his observations on wealth. He talks about an "evil" thing, that is, that man works hard and gets wealth, but he cannot enjoy it. We do not know what the circumstances are that prevent him from enjoying his wealth, but we know that for some reason it is given to another to enjoy.Koheleti sasa anaendelea  na uchunguzi wake kuhusu utajiri.Anazungumza kuhusu  kitu " kiovu," kwamba mwanadamu hujishughulisha kwa nguvu ili kupata utajiri, lakini hawezi kufurahia.Hatujui madhara yake ni yapi kumuepusha  na  kufurahia utajiri wake, lakini tunajua kwamba kwa baadhi ya sababu imetolewa kwa mwingine ili afurahie.

## Long life does not guarentee hapiness (v. 3–6)
## Maisha marefu hayatoi dhamana ya furaha (mst. 3-6)

Long life (Prov. 3:2) and many children (Psalm 127:4) were considered great blessings in ancient Israel, but Qohelet says that even these cannot bring rest to a weary life. He says that the stillborn baby who has never known life is better than the person who has long life. he says this because the stillborn does not have to face the troubles of life. Maisha marefu (Mithali 3:2) na watoto wengi (Zaburi 127:4) zilihusisha Baraka kuu katika Israel zamani, lakini Koheleti anasema kwamba hata hizi haziwezi kuleta pumziko katika maisha ya uchovu.Anasema kuwa mtoto aliyezaliwa akiwa amekufa ambaye hajawahi kuyajua maisha ni bora kuliko mtu mwenye maisha marefu. Anasema hili kwasababu mtoto aliyezaliwa hali mfu hatapata shida za maisha.

## Appetite is never satisfied (v. 7)
## Hamu daima haitaridhishwa (mst. 7)

We work hard for food, and then we eat it. Afterward we are hungry again.Tunafanya kazi kwa nguvu kwaajili ya kupata mambo mazuri, na kula pia.Baadae tunakuwa na njaa tena.

## Wisdom is better than foolishness (v. 8–9)
## Hekima ni bora kuliko ujinga (mst. 8-9)

## Conclusion to the search for meaning (v. 10–12)
## Hitimisho kwa utafutaji wa maana (mst. 10-12)

Thses verse conclude Qohelet's search for meaning. "Here leaves his explicit search for meaning and in the second half of the book focuses on advice and commentary about the future."[1] Verse 10 says "that which hath been is named already," and it is repeating the idea that there is nothing new under the sun (3:15). Mstari huu unahitimisha utafutaji wa Koheleti. "Anaacha uwazi kwa maana na katika nusu ya kitabu unalenga katika ushauri na maoni kuhusu wakati ujao. "[1] Mstari wa 10 unasema "kwamba yale yaliyoko yamekuwako; na hayo yatakayokuwako;yamekwisha kuwako; na anarudia wazo kuwa hakuna jipya chini ya jua (3:15)
