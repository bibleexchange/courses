## The opening narrative (chapter 1)
##Hadithi za ufunguzi (sura ya 1 )

No time is wasted here. Job’s character is described, his substance quantified, and then all is lost. Hakuna muda uliopotezwa  hapa. Tabia ya Ayubu imeelezewa,kiini chake kilipimwa,na kisha yote yalipotea.

### Satan
### Shetani

The name _Satan_ really means "adversary," but in all the Old Testament he is only mentioned a few times.Jina –shetani-kweli linamaanisha “adu’,lakini katika agano la kale alitajwa mara chache. Even more startling is that he appears before God along with the angels. Cha kushangaza zaidi ni kwamba ametokea kabla ya Mungu pamoja na malaika. It is not until the end of Revelation that he is cast out of the presence of God for good. Siyo mpaka mwisho wa ufunuo kwamba alitupwa nje ya uwepo wa Mungu kwa mazuri.How else could he be the accuser of the brethren unless he has an audience with God. His presence reminds us that the adversary of the Old Testament patriarchs and Israel is almost always a natural force such as drought, famine, or a hostile nation.Ni kwa jinsi gani angekuwa tena mhukumu wa ndugu zake isipokuwa ana watazamaji na Mungu.Uwepo wake unatukumbusha kuwa adui wa agano la kale viongozi na Israeli siku zote ilikuwa nguvu ya asili kama vile ukame,njaa,au nchi yenye uadui. Here we have a quick reminder that the real battle is for the human race and their souls. As Christians we assume this has always been understood because Jesus exposed the devil in such a way the we are always aware of this fight, but the lack of text about Satan should remind us that this passage allowed the reader at that time, a special look into things not yet understood.Hapa tuna mawaidha kuwa vita ya kweli ni kwaajili yam bio za wanadamu na roho zao.Kama wakristo tunadhani hii siku zote imeeleweka  kwasababu Yesu alimfunua shetani katika njia  kwamba siku zote tunafahamuu kuhusu vita hii,lakini uhaba wa nakala kuhusu shetani inatakiwa itukumbushe sisi kuwa ujumbe huu unamruhusu msomaji katika muda huo,mtazamo muhimu wa vitu ambavyo bado havijaeleweka.

### Who’s in charge here? 
### Nani anawajibika hapa?

Read verse 15. Mstari wa 15.The Sabeans took Jobs cattle.Waseba wakawashambulia mifugo. If you did not know the story of what happened in heaven (which Job did not), we would assume that the Sabeans of their of free-will saw an opportunity and stole them.Soma mstari wa 15. Kama hukujua habari ya nini kilitokea mbinguni (ambapo Ayubu hakujua) However, we do have the plot and we know that Satan made them do it but Satan could only do what God would allow so God took Jobs cattle. Hata hivyo,hatukua na sehemu na tunajua kuwa shetani aliwafanya watende hilo lakini shetani angefanya tu kile ambacho Mungu ameruhusu hivyo Mungu alichukua mifugo ya Ayubu. The Sabeans were cattle thieves from the start and Satan only had to present them the opportunity.Waseba  walikuwa wezi wa mifugo kuanzia mwanzo  na shetani yeye aliwaonyesha tu fursa.Satan was a liar from the beginning and the advisory of all mankind. Shetani alikuwa muongo tokea mwanzo na mshauri wa  watu.He only needed permission to act, but God granted the authority for the action. Alihitaji tu ruhusa ya kufanya,lakini Mungu alitoa mamlaka ya kutenda.This destroys the idea of dualism. If Satan must ask God for permission then Good and Evil or God and the Devil are not equal opposing forces as dualism suggest. Dualism is a view that robs God of his sovereign control of the universe. Hii inaangamiza wazo la uwili.Kama shetani lazima aombe ruhusa kwa Mungu basi mema na mabaya au Mungu na shetani hawako sawa wakikataa nguvu kama pendekezo la uwili.Uwili ni wazo ambalo linamwibia Mungu na uhuru wake wa kutawala ulimwengu.

### Is God the author of evil?
### Je Mungu ni mwandishi wa uovu?

The next question is not so easy. Swali la pili siyo rahisi .  Is God the author of evil? Je Mungu ni mwandishi wa uovu?  We know that He created calamity for the day of calamity and that He could stop any act at any moment, but He allows trouble and suffering to continue.Tunajua kuwa aliumba msiba kwa siku ya msiba na kwamba anaweza kuzuia jambo lolote kwa wakati wowote,lakini huruhusu shida na mateso kuendelea. We know that He knows the end from the beginning so that nothing surprises Him, so if He knows what is going to happen and can stop it but does not, we can reason that He ordained it.Tunajua kwamba alijua mwisho kutokea mwanzo kwa hiyo hakuna cha kumshangaza yeye,hivyo  kama anajua kile kitakachotokea na anaweza kukizuia lakini hazuii,tunaweza kusema kuwa ameliweka wakfu. But we need to make a distinction here. Ill will toward someone is the evil present in Satan and the Sabeans.Lakini tunatakiwa kufanya tofauti hapa. The will to allow trouble to happen to Job is with God, but it is not born out of ill will toward Job.Mwenye maamuzi ya kuruhusu shida kutokea kwa Ayubu ni Mungu,lakini ugojwa haukuzaliwa kwaajili ya Ayubu.  Our mistake is that we see them as the same thing.Kosa letu ni kwamba tunawaona wao kama kitu kimoja. God allowing trouble is not the same as Satan’s intent to hurt someone with that same trouble. Mungu kuruhusu shida  siyo sawa na dhamira ya shetani kumuumiza mtu kwa sahida hiyo.So who is responsible? God, Satan, and the Sabeans are responsible, but all for different reasons.Sasa nani anahusika?Mungu,shetani,na Waseba wanahusika,lakini wote kwa sababu tofauti, Do not allow your mind to reduce God’s character in order to solve this problem. Josephs brother meant it for evil but God meant it for good.   Usiruhusu akili yako kupunguza sifa ya Mungu ili kutatua tatizo.Kaka zake Yusufu walimtakia mabaya lakini Mungu alimtakia mema.

As the chapter comes to a close we see Job strong in his will to continue to serve and honor God.Mlango unapokuja karibu tunamuona Ayubu akiwa imara katika mapenzi yake kuendelea kumtumikia na kumheshimu Mungu. Verse 21 is one of his great statements of strength and dedication.Mstari wa 21 ni moja ya wazo lake kuu lenye nguvu na kujitoa. Job coins some memorable phrases for us to look to in times of trouble and use in times of exhortation.Ayubu anatoa mistari baadhi ya kukumbuka kwaajili yetu ya kuangalia wakati wa majaribu na kuitumia katika nyakati za kuonya. Finally, notice the succinct way the chapter closes, almost as if the book is ending and Job has escaped with his life and integrity, like a storm that a ship seems to have outrun, surly this is enough for one man to endure.Mwisho,angalia njia fupi mlango huu unapoishia,zaidi kama vile kitabu kinaishia na Ayubu alitoroka na familia yake na uadilifu,kama dhoruba kuwa meli kuwa na uwazi,kihakika hii inatosha kwa mwanadamu kuvumilia.
