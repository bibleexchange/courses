# Thoughts on worship and wealth (chapter 5)
# Mawazo kuhusu kuabudu na utajiri (sura ya 5)

## Worship (v. 1–7)
## Kuabudu (mst. 1-7)

### Sacrifices (v. 1)
### Dhabihu (mst. 1)

Qohelet warns about making the "sacrifice of fools." "The sacrifice of the fools should be thought of not as a denial of the value of sacrifice per se but as a critique of superficial religion that goes through the rituals with many words but no awareness of God."[1] There are other warnings in the Old Testament about offering vain sacrifices to God, such as 1 Samuel 15:22–23, Psalm 40:6, and Isaiah 1:11. These verses combined show us that God is not pleased with sacrifices if the heart of the giver was unclean. Koheleti anaonya kuhusu kufanya "Dhabihu za ujinga."  "Dhabihu za ujinga lazima yawe mawazo na si ya kukana thamani ya dhabihu kwa sasa lakini kama kukosoa kwa juu juu dini inayoenda kupitia ibada pamoja na maneno mengi lakini hakuna ufahamu wa Mungu."[1] Kuna maonyo mengine katika agano la kale kuhusu kutoa bure dhabihu kwa Mungu, kama vile 1 Samwel 15:22-23, Psalm 40:6, na Isaya 1:11. Mistari hii iliyounganishwa inatuonesha kwamba Mungu hapendezwi na dhabihu kama moyo wa mtoaji ni mchafu.

### Prayer (v. 2–3)
### Maombi (mst. 2-3)

In verse 1, there is instruction that those that go to the temple should be ready to listen.Katika mstari wa 1, kuna maelekezo kwamba wale wanaoenda hekaluni lazima awe tayari kusikiliza. The idea is continued through verse 7.Wazo limeendelezwa kupitia mstari wa 7. It is instruction to listen more than we talk, and specifically to listen more to God than we talk to Him.Ni maelekezo kusikiliza zaidi ya kuzungumza, na hasa kusikiliza zaidi kwa Mungu zaidi ya vile tunavyomsikiliza. The principles of listening to instruction and controlling how much we talk are found often in the book of Proverbs (Prov. 2:2; 4:20; 5:1; 15:31; 18:15; 21:13; 22:17; 23:12; 25:12; 28:9). Kanuni ya kusikiliza maelekezo na kuthibiti vile tunavyoongea vinapatikana  mara nyingi katika kitabu cha Mithali (Mith.2:2;4:20; 5:1; 15:31; 18:15; 21:13; 22:17; 23:12; 25:12; 28:9). There is considerable similarities with Ecclesiastes 5:3b, which says, "a fool’s voice is known by multitude of words" and Proverbs 17:28, which says, "Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise." Jesus also warned against praying with "vain repetitions" and thinking that your prayer will be heard because you use many words (Matt. 6:7).Kuna mifanano inayoangaliwa na Mhubiri 5:3b, unaosema, na sauti ya mpumbavu kwa njia ya wingi wa maneno na Mithali 17:28, unaosema Hata mpumbavu akinyamaza, huhesabiwa hekima; Akifumba midomo yake, huhesabiwa ufahamu. "Yesu pia ameonya dhidi ya kuomba kwa " kurudiarudia bure”na kufikiria kwamba maombi yako yatasikiwa kwsababu unatumia maneno mengi (Math.6:7).

### Vows (v. 4–7)
### Viapo (mst. 4-7)

Qohelet continues the idea of being careful with our words by giving advice on making vows to God. He said that it is better to not make a vow than to make a vow and break it. Jesus went farther with this teaching, and He said that we shouldn't make any vows at all (Matt. 5:33–37).Koheleti anaendelea na wazo la kuwa makini na maneno yetu kwa kutoa ushauri wa kuweka viapo kwa Mungu.Alisema kwamba ni bora kutoweka kiapo kuliko kuweka kiapo na kuivunja.Yesu alienda mbali zaidi na mafundisho yake, na alisema kwamba hatutakiwi kuweka viapo kabisa (Math.5:33-37).

## Oppression and wealth (v. 8–17)
## Ukandamizaji  na utajiri (mst. 8-17)

### Oppression by government (v. 8–9)
### Ukandamizaji kutoka kwa serikali (mst. 8-9)

### The burden of wealth (v. 10–17)
### Mzigo wa utajiri (mst. 10-17)

* Wealth never satisfy (v. 10)
* Utajiri kamwe hauridhishi (mst. 10)
* When you have more wealth, you have more problems (v. 11)
* Ukiwa na utajiri mwingi, unakuwa na matatizo mengi (mst. 11)
* Wealth can cause anxiety, which robs you of sleep (v. 12)
* Utajiri unaweza kusababisha wasiwasi, ambao unaokuibia usingizi (mst. 11)
* We cannot take wealth with us to death (v. 13–17)
* Hatuwezi kwenda na utajiri wetu tunapokufa (mst. 13-17)

## The gift of God (v. 18–20)
## Zawadi ya Mungu (mst. 18-20)

Wealth may not satisfy, but God does give blessings to every person. They can eat, drink and enjoy life. This is similar to statements in 2:24–26 and 9:7–10.Utajiri unaweza usiridhishe, lakini Mungu hutoa Baraka kwa kila mtu. Wanaweza kula, kunywa na kufurahia maisha. Hii inafanana na taarifa katika 2:24-26 na 9:7-10.
