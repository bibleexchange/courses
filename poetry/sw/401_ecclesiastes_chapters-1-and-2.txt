## All is vanity (chapters 1–2)

In these two chapters, we have an introduction, the search for meaning in life, and some conclusions made from the search.

## Introduction by narrator (1:1–2)

## Examples of futility (1:4–11)

These are reflections on the monotonous routines of life. Life under the sun is meaningless, and the writer gives some examples of futility.

### Passing of generations (1:4)

Is man born only so he can later cease to exist?

### Cycles of nature (1:5–7)

Nature is always repeating itself. There is no real, lasting change.

### Curiosity of man (1:8)

With the curiosity of man and all his efforts, the more he learns the more questions he raises.

### Absence of newness (1:9–11)

## Philosophies of futility

Man has created philosophies of life to help him live/cope with this conclusion. The answer is not "there is no answer." Those spiritully minded do not settle for "life is vain" but they search for meaning **beyond** this life. If the answer is not found beneath the sun, then it is found above the sun, beyond ourselves. For every need of man there is a corresponding satisfaction (hunger—food, etc.). If we find a desire for which nothing in this world can satisfy, it is logical to assume we are made for another world.

> The Christian says, 'Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing.  
> —C. S. Lewis

## The search for meaning (1:12–2:23)

### Acquiring wisdom and knowledge (1:12–18)

The search of the natural man for satisfaction and happiness. Qoholeth explains how he reached the conclusions stated in 1:12–13. Qoholeth also expresses what he had learned in his searching:

1. All lifestyles are meaningless (1:14)
2. Nothing can be changed (1:15)
3. Knowledge is useless (1:16–17)
4. Desire for knowledge brings much pain (1:18) 

The current generation is a prime example of the vanity of just "more knowledge." People say, "I've got all this knowledge and now I feel worse." Why? You can't know what you need to know in order to produce peace, contentment, joy, etc. People say, "Let's build high, let's fly to the moon, to Mars, etc." What have we discovered? More information on the **parts** and not explanation of the **whole**. Qoholeth is not anti-knowledge, but he is concluding rigthly that human knowledge without reference to God is **never satisfying**.

### Worldly pleasure (2:1–3)

### Art or agriculture (2:4–6)

### Great possessions (2:7–11)

## Conclusions

### A wise man is superior to the fool (2:12–21)

### "nothing better than to eat and drink and enjoy life" (2:24–26)

The main thought is that some answers will not be found here on earth. They answers are found "beyond the sun" and are spiritual in nature. Under the sun, you will not find the answer why you are under the sun. The answer is **beyond** the sun.
