## The conclusion (chapters 38-42)
## Hitimisho (Mlango wa 38-42)

We are ready for a rescue. We are tired of words that change nothing, we are tired of Job’s condition, and we are tired of wondering how God is going to keep His goodness intact while He explains to Job His perfect will for him. Then we read on and words hit us like a wrecking ball because none of our expectations are met.Tuko tayari kwaajili ya kuokolewa. Tumechoka na maneno ambayo hayabadilishi chochote,tumechoka na hali ya Ayubu,na tumechoka kushangaa jinsi  gani Mungu atatimiza mema yakeyasiyoharibika wakati anaeleza kwa Ayubu mapenzi kamili kwaajili yake.Halafu tunaendelea kusoma na maneo yanatupiga sisi kama mpira ulioanguka kwasababu hakuna matarajio yetu hayajafikiwa. 

In 38:2, God asks, "Who is this?" It’s Job, your faithful servant, surely you know who he is. The question is not, "who are you?" It is, "who do you think you are?" And in 38:3, God said, "I will demand of thee, and answer thou me." It was like He was saying, "Since you seem to know so much, let me ask you some questions."Katika 38:2,Mungu anauliza, “Huyu ni nani?Ni Ayubu,mtumishi wako mwaminifu,kweli unajua yeye ni nani.Swali siyo, “Wewe ni nani?” Ni, “Unafikiri wewe ni nani?” Na katika 38:3,Mungu alisema, “Nitakuuliza neno,nawe nijibu mimi. “Ni kama vile alikuwa anasema, “Kwa kuwa unaonekana kujua mengi,acha nikuulize maswali machache.

In two statements God has reduced Job to rubble. It’s not what we expect, but by claiming righteousness and wisdom, Job has encroached on Gods glory. He has trespassed into His place. Before we can peruse true righteousness and wisdom, we must first be taught humility. This may be the most painful place in the whole book. Katika taarifa mbili Mungu alipunguza kifusi kwa Ayubu.Siyo kile tunachotarajia,bali kwa kudai haki na hekima,Ayubu alienea katika utukufu wa Mungu.Aliingia kimakosa katika eneo lake.Kabla ya kuperuzi haki ya kweli na hekima,Lazima kwanza tufundishwe utu. Hii inaweza kuwa eeneo la kuumiza sana katika kitabu kizima.
 
### Why the questions?
### Kwanini maswali?

They initially come across as a statement of qualification.Awali hii inakuja kama taarifa ya kufuzu. If you can answer any of these questions, then I will answer yours.Kama unaweza kujibu swali lolote kati ya haya,,basi nitakujibu maswali yako. It is a response to Job’s request for an audience with God. The Lord is saying, "If you would like to speak to me as if we are on equal terms, then prove you are equal.Ni jukumu kwa ombi la Ayubu kwa watazamaji na Mungu.Bwana anasema, “Kama ungependa kuzungumza name kama tuko sawa,basi thibitisha kuwa sawa,halafu  thibitisha uko sawa." The central theme is "Job is not worthy of an answer from God." All knowledge of God is a gift, and all answers and revelations are gifts of grace. “Dhana ya kati ni  “Ayubu hastahili jibu kutoka kwa Mungu. “Maarifa yote ya Mungu ni zawadi,na maswali yote na mafunuo ni zawadi za neema. We feel so entitled to an explanation, and we can suffer quietly as long as we know how long, how bad, and for what purpose we are suffering. Tunajisikia kuwekwa juu sana katika maelezo,na tunaweza kupata shida kimya kimya  kama tunajua,ni kwa muda gani,ni mbaya kiasi gani,na na kwa lengo gani tunateseka.He did not reveal it to Job, and He will not likely reveal it to us.Hakumfunulia Ayubu,na hatatufulia sisi pia. If we knew the purpose we would change our behavior and the purpose would be lost.  Kama tungejua lengo tungebadilisha tabia zetu na malengo yangepotea.  

### What are the questions?
### Maswali ni yapi?

They began with creation and moved on to the natural world. Walianzia na uumbaji na kuendelea mbele katia dunia halisi.They speak of weather and animals and are filled with questions that Job has not asked or even thought of.Wanazungumzia utajiri na wanyama na zilitimizwa na maswali kuwa Ayubu hajauliza au hata kufikiria. Most importantly, he cannot answer one of them. The central theme is "If Job cannot answer these questions, he would not be able to understand why even if God told him.La muhimu zaidi,hawezi kujibu moja ya hayo.Dhanaya kati ni  “Kama Ayubu hawezi kujibu maswali  haya,asingeweza kuelewa kwanini hata Mungu alimwambia." Also, the use of questions from creation seems to say to Job, "only if you had been here from the beginning could you understand the purpose. “Pia, matumizi ya maswali katika uumbaji kama vile yanamzungumzia Ayubu, “Kama ungekuwa hapa tangu mwanzo ndiyo ungeelewa lengo hili." Likewise, we cannot know the full reason for our trials. It is foolish to think we are worthy of an answer, and foolish to think we could understand even if we were told. Job is a God-exalting, man-humbling book.Vivyo hivyo,Hatuwezi kujua sababu iliyojaa kwa majaribu yetu.Ni ujinga kufikiri kuwa tunastahili jibu,na ujinga kufikiri tungeelewa hata kama tungeambiwa.Ayubu ni  mtu anayemuinua Mungu,kitabu cha mtu mnyenyekevu.

### Final point
### Jambo la mwisho

When we struggle in life we wrestle with all the questions that come out in this book. When we read the Bible we often do the same. We can trace it all back to that one tree in the garden that was not like any other tree. If God knew what Adam and Eve would do, why did He put the tree there in the first place? Firstly, it was the opportunity to serve Him in a special way. More importantly, the world was created so that God could redeem from it a bride for His Son. For that bride to be perfect, she must be redeemed. In order to be redeemed, she must first fall. The purposes of God are too big for us to understand, let us rejoice that we have been given a part, and never forget that his own Son suffered according to this mater plan. "Not my will but thine be done."Tunapopata shida katika maisha tunashindana na maswaliyanayokuja katika kitabu hiki.Tukisoma biblia mara nyingi tunafanya yale yale.Tunaweza kuingilia kimakosa  katika mti huo mmoja katika bustani kuwa haikuwa kama miti mingine.Kama Mungu angejua kile ambacho Adamu na Eva wangefanya,kwanini aliweka mti ule pale katika eneo la kwanza?Kwanza,ilikuwa nafasi ya kumtumikia katika njia maalumu.Ya muhimu zaidi dunia iliumbwa ili Mungu amkomboe bibi harusi kuwa kamili,lazima akombolewe.Ili ukombolewe,lazima aanguke kwanza.Malengo ya Mungu ni makubwa sana kwetu kuelewa,acha tufurahi kwamba tumepata sehemu,na kamwe tusisahau kuwa mwana wake wa pekee aliteseka kulingana na mpango hii. “Siyo mapenzi yangu bali mapenzi yake yafanyike.”
