## The debate (chapters 3–37)
##Mjadala (Mlango wa 3-37)

There is no way to cover the conversations chapter by chapter without losing interest due to repetition. Hakuna njia ya kufunika  maongezi  ya mlango kwa mlango bila kupoteza  mvuto kwaajili ya marudio.At the same time there is no way to cover them in one section of notes.Wakati huo huo hakuna njia ya kuzifunika katika sehemu ya nukuhu. So this next section is my attempt to bring out the main themes of the conversation between Job and his friends.Kwa hiyo sehemu hii inayofuata ni majaribio yangu ya kuleta wazo kuu la mazungumzo kati ya Ayubu na rafiki zake. The dialogue is lengthy and wordy at times.Mazungumzo ni marefu na maneno mengi kwa nyakati. This may be due to their place in history, but may also shed some light on the disposition of the speakers. Let’s try to point out some common threads that are woven throughout this section. Hii inaweza kuwa kwasababu ya maeneo yao katika historia,lakini inaweza pia kutia mwanga katika mkoa wa mzungumzaji.Acha tujaribu kuonyesha baadhi ya nyuzi ambazo zinasukwa katika sehemu hii yote.

### The big question: "Why?"
### Swali kubwa: “Kwanini?”

The question, "Why?" is not stated plainly in any of the discussion. Swali, “Kwanini”haisemwi waziwazi katika majadiliano yeyote.Job does not have the luxury of knowing that this is a competition of sorts between higher powers.Ayubu hana anasa ya kujua kuwa haya ni marudio ya aina kati ya nguvu kubwa. He and his friends never ask the question directly, but every one of their speeches contains an effort to answer the question, "why is this happening to Job?" Their reasoning is centered on an idea that seems agreed upon by all parties:Yeye na rafiki zake hawakuwahi kuuliza swali moja kwa moja,lakini kila moja ya hotuba ina jitihada za kujibu swali, “kwanini haya yalitokea kwa Ayubu?”Sababu zao zimelenga katika wazo linaloonyesha kukubaliwa kwa vyama vyote: "God blesses righteousness and punishes sin." This assumption leads his friends to the conclusion that Job has sinned. “Mungu huwabariki wenye haki na kuwahukumu wenye dhambi. “Dhana hii inatupelekea rafiki zake katika hitimisho kuwa Ayubu amefanya dhambi. Because of this, Job is drawn into a debate where he defends his own righteousness.Kwasababu ya hili,Ayubu amejengwa katika mjadala ambapo alitetea haki yake mwenyewe. This prompts his friends to say that Job is elevating himself above God and they go on and on about the righteousness of God. Hii inawaharakisha rafiki zake kusema kuwa Ayubu anajiinua mwenyewe juu ya Mungu na wanaendelea mbele mbele kuhusu haki ya Mungu.Job agrees, but he realizes that they are only trying to defend their first position, and therefore he again defends his position.Ayubu anakubali,lakini anagundua kuwa wanajaribu tu kuzitetea nafasi zao,na hivyo anatetea tena nafasi yake. If there is any fault in Job, it is that he is self-righteous, however do not forget that he was drawn into this position by a false assumption, three critical friends, and the worst tragedy recorded in the Bible. Kama kuna kosa lolote,ni  kwamba yeye mwenyewe ni mwenye haki,hata hivyo usisahau kuwa alijengwa katika nafasi hiii kwa dhana mbaya,na majanga mbaya sana iliyonakiliwa katika biblia.The original assumption was, "God blesses righteousness and punishes sin." We all know this to be true on the surface and the Bible supports it, but there is not a one-to-one correlation.Dhana halisi ilikuwa, :Mungu anabariki wenye haki na kuhukumu wenye dhambi. “Wote tunajua kuwa hili ni kweli katika uso na biblia inakubaliana na hili,lakini hakuna uwiano wa moja kwa moja. Jesus heals the blind and says, "go and sin no more lest a worst thing come upon you," and then in another case he is asked who sinned that this man was made blind and he answers, "no man but that the glory of God may be manifest.Yesu anamponya kipofu na kusema, “nenda na usitende dhambi tena, “ na baada ya hapo katika kesi nyingine aliulizwa nani alitenda dhambi kuwa mtu huyu alifanywa kipofu na anajibu, “hakuna mtu bali ugonjwa huu ni kwaajili ya utukufu wa Mungu." What Job and his friends are not allowing for is that there is another level, which only God Himself can see and in that place man may suffer without doing wrong. “Kitu ambacho Ayubu na rafiki zake hawaruhusu ni kwamba kuna hatua nyingine,ambayo Mungu peke yake anaweza kuona na katika sehemu hiyo mtu anaweza kuteseka bila kufanya mabaya. So in an attempt to answer why, and armed with an incomplete doctrine of the goodness of God, Job becomes more and more frustrated and confused as the discussion goes on. This condition leads us to our next point. Hivyo katika jaribio la kujibu kwanini,na silaha pamoja na mafundisho ambayo hayajatimia ya mema ya Mungu,Ayubu anakata tama na  kuchanganyikiwa zaidi majadiliano yanapoendelea.Sharti hili linatuongoza sisi katika hatua nyingine.

### The mediator
### Mjumbe

Because Job cannot convince his friends that he is innocent, he begins to call upon the Lord for an answer. The point is made that there is not a man to stand between him and God (9:32-33). We cannot read this without recognizing the solution to the problem is Christ. We now have a mediator who is God and has been a man so that perfect mediation can be made for us. Job did not have this. The absence of a mediator caused him to ask for an answer directly from God (3:1-9). This is a request he will be granted but will not enjoy.Kwasababu Ayubu hawezi kuwashawishi rafiki zake kuwa yeye ni mwenye haki,anaanza kumuita Bwana kwaajili ya majibu.Fikra imejengwa kuwa hakuna mwanadamu wa kusimama katikati yake na Mungu(9:32-33).Hatuwezi kusoma hiki bila kugundua suluhisho la tatizo ni Kristo.Sasa tuna mjumbe ambaye ni Mungu na amekuwa mtu ili kwamba mjumbe mtimilifu atengenezwe kwetu.Ayubu hakuwa na hili.Kutokuwepo kwa mjumbe kulimsababisha yeye aulize jibu moja kwa moja kutoka kwa Mungu (3:1-9).Hili ni ombi atapewa ruhusa lakini hatafurahia.

### Integrity
### Uadilifu

Though he made mistakes and was drawn into boasting and became bold enough to ask for a meeting with God, he did not sin or curse God.Pamoja na kuwa alifanya makosa na kufanywa fahari na kuwa shujaaa kutosha kuuliza kikao na Mungu,hakutenda dhambi au kumlaani Mungu. They did not try to misplace Job’s condition as some random act of chance as we would today. Hawakujaribu kupotosha hali ya Ayubu kama matendo ya hovyo ya nafasi kama ambavyo tungefanya leo.We would blame the fall, the world, sinners and so on to account for the suffering, but Job does not degrade God’s character by allowing this event to become something God did not see coming or could not stop. Tunaweza kulaumu anguko,dunia,wenye dhambi na mengineyo kama sababu ya mateso,lakini Ayubu haharibu sifa ya Mungu kwa kuruhusutukio hili kuwa kitu ambacho Mungu hakuona kikija hakukiziua.The event lies in the hands of God and Job is angry but does not curse Him.Tukio linadanganya katika mikono ya Mungu na Ayubu anakasirika lakini hamlaani Mungu. He is frustrated, but he does not sin. In our day, there is a lack of regard for keeping the commandments, but in the day of confusion and trouble the commandments are an anchor.Alikata tama,lakini hakutenda dhambi.Katika siku zetu,kuna uoungufu wa kujali na kuzitii amri,lakini katika siku za kuchanyanyikiwa na shida amri zinakuwa nanga. They can be kept when we feel no love toward God, and in the simple act of keeping them we show that we truly love Him no matter how we feel. Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my commandments."Zinaweza kuhifadhiwa tunapojiskia hakuna upendo kwa Mungu,na katika matendo mepesi ya kuzitenda tunaonyesha kweli tunampenda bila kujali tunajisikiaje.Yesu alisema, “Ukinipenda,utazishika amri zangu.

#### Wealth
#### Utajiri

Surprisingly, Job never once mentioned loosing anything. Cha kushangaza,Ayubu hakuwahi kutajwa kuwa amepoteza kitu.Today, we would only care about the value of the cattle and houses. Leo,tungejali tu kuhusu thamani ya mifugo na nyumba.We would cry over the death of our loved ones, but Job is from the east, and his main focus is the loss of respect and honor in the community. Tungelia kwaajili ya vifo vya wapendwa wetu,lakini Ayubu anatokea mashariki,na shabaha yake kuu ni kupoteza utii na heshima katika jamii.This may be because of time or location or both, but it still applies in our day.Hii inaweza kuwa kwasababu ya muda au eneo au yote mawili,lakini bado inaweza kutusaidia leo katika siku zetu. Maybe that’s because he worked so hard to gain honor, and maybe we don’t think much about it because we’ve never earned it in the first place.Labda hii ni kwasababu alifanya kazi kwa nguvu kurudisha heshima,na labda hatufikiri sana kuhusu hiyo kwasababu hatujawahi kupata kitu mwanzo.
