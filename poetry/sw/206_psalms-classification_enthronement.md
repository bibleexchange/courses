# The psalms of enthronement
# Zaburi za enzi

## Introduction
##  Utangulizi

The **psalms of enthronement** contain the expression “the Lord reigns” (or, in the case of Psalm 98, “the Lord, the King”), and speak of the rule of God over all the earth. He is "kingly" to the greatest extant. A king reigns, has domimion and a good king is the joy of His people. These psalms are 47, 93, 95–99. “Zaburi za enzi **zina maelezo  “Bwana anatawala”(au,katika kesi ya zaburi ya 98, “Bwana,Mfalme”),na inazungumzia sheria ya Mungu juu ya dunia nzima.Yeye ni “kifalme”katika ukubwa uliokuwepo.  Mfalme anatawala,ana mamlaka na mfalme mzuri ni furaha ya watu wake.  Zaburi hizi ni 47,93,95-99.

The majority of these come after 89, which expresses discouragement about the ending of the kingship of Israel. These psalms show that even though the earthly kingdom may fail, the heavenly kingdom will never fail.Wingi wa hizi huja baada ya 89,inayoeleza kukata tamaa kuhusu mwisho wa ufalme wa Israel. Zaburi hizi zinaonyesha  kwamba hata kama ufalme wa kidunia utashindwa,ufalme wa mbinguni hautashindwa kamwe.

God is the king of Israel, but He is also king over the heathen (47:8) and over all the earth (47:2). He is above all other gods (97:7–9).Mungu ni mfalme wa Israel,lakini pia ni mfalme juu ya mataifa (47:8) na juu ya dunia dunia nzima(47:2).  Ni juu ya miungu mingine yote (97:7-9).

## The Lord is sovereign in righteousness and justice
## Bwana ni mfalme katika uadilifu na haki

> Where there is no injustice, there is little need to speak of justice. The frequency of the topic of justice in these psalms would therefore suggest that they were intended to deal with circumstances where injustice had become rife.>Mahali ambapo hakuna haki,kuna uhitaji mdogo kuongea kuhusu haki. Marudio ya mada ya haki katika zaburi hizi yanapendekeza kwamba yalikusudiwa kuhusika na hali ambazo kutokuwa na haki umekuwa mkubwa.>

Psalm 97:2 says that, "righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne." His righteousness has been not only revealed to the Israelites, but it has also be shown to the heathen (98:2).Zaburi ya 97:2 inasema kwamba, “haki na hukumu ni makao ya kiti chake cha enzi.  Haki yake imekuwa siyo tu imefunuliwa kwa waisrael,lakini imeonyeshwa pia katika mataifa(98:2)

## The Lord is sovereign in creation
## Bwana ni mfalme katika uumbaji

God made everything. He made the sea, land (95:5), and the heavens (96:5). He also created humans, so we must worship Him (95:6). He alone is Creator. All the other gods are just idols that have been created by man (96:5). Mungu ameumba kila kitu.Ameumba bahari,ardhi(95:5),na mbinguni (96:5).Pia ameumba wanadamu,hivyo lazima tumuabudu yeye (95:6)Yeye mwenyewe ni muumbaji.miungu mingine yote ni sanamu ambazo zimeumbwa na mwanadamu (96:5).

God has power over creation. Mungu ana nguvu juu ya uumbaji.The earth moves (99:1), the earth trembles (97:4), and the hills melt like wax (97:5) before the power of God. Dunia inazunguka (99:1), Dunia inatetemeka (97:4), na milima huyeyuka kama nta (97:5) kabla ya nguvu ya Mungu. All of His creation praises Him.  Uumbaji wake wote unamsifu. The heavens rejoice (96:11), the earth is glad (96:11) and rejoices (97:1), the field is joyful (96:12), all the trees of the wood rejoice (96:12), the multitude of isles are glad (97:1), the heavens declare his righteousness (97:6), the floods clap their hands (98:8), and the hills are joyful (98:8) because of what God has done. Mbingu zinamsifu (96:11),Dunia ina furaha (96:11) na kushangilia (97:1),mbingu zinatangaza haki yake (97:6),Mito na ipige makofu (98:8),na milima inafurahi (98:8 kwasababu ya nini Mungu amefanya.

## The Lord is sovereign in judgment
## Bwana ni mfalme katika hukumu

His judgment is righteous and based on the truth (96:10, 13), which means that it is good and fair judgment. He judges all people, not just the Israelites (96:13). The purpose of His judgment is to bring equity (99:4). Hukumu zake ni haki na misingi yake ni katika dunia (96:10,13),yenye maana kwamba ni hukumu za haki na nzuri . Anahukumu watu wote,siyo tu waisrael (96:13).Lengo la hukumu zake ni kuleta usawa (99:4).

Psalm 47:2 says that God is **terrible**. (See also 45:4; 65:5; 66:3, 5; 68:35; 76:12; 99:3; 106:22.) What does it mean that God is terrible? "The terror of the Lord" speaks of the reverence or fear inspired by the thought that God is judge (2 Corinthians 5:10–11).Zaburi ya 47:2 inasema kwamba Mungu ni **wa kutisha **.(angalia pia  45:4; 65:5; 66:3, 5; 68:35; 76:12; 99:3; 106:22.)Ina maana gani kuwa Mungu ni wa kutisha? “Hofu ya Bwana” inazungumzia kuhusu heshima au hofu inayosukumwa na mawazo kwamba Mungu ni mhukumu (2 kor 5:10-11).

## The Lord is the sovereign king of the future
## Bwana ni  mfalme mkuu ajaye

There is a forward-looking aspect in 98:9. It is looking forward in time to when the kingdom of God will be fully manifested.   Kuna mtazamo wa mbele katika Zaburi ya 98:9.  Inaangalia mbele kwa lini ufalme wa Mungu utafunuliwa kabisa.
