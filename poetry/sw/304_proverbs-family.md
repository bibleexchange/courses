## Advice to parents
##Ushauri kwa wazazi

Proverbs teaches that parents should provide for their families (13:22; 31:13–15). It also tells parents that they should teach their children (22:6). Mithali inawafundisha kwamba wazazi lazima wahudumie familia zao(13:22;31:13-15).Pia inawaambia wazazi kwamba lazima wafundishe watoto wao(22:6)The book of Proverbs is an example of this kind of teaching.Kitabu ca mithali ni mfano wa mafundisho haya. The book itself is written as a father instructing his son.Kitabu chenyewe kimeandikwa kama baba akimuelekeza mtoto.

We are to correct our children (29:15). If you love your children, you will correct them (13:24; 19:18; 22:15; 23:13–14; 29:17).Tunatakiwa tuwasahihishe watoto wetu (29:15).Kama unawapenda watoto wako,utawasahihisha(13:24;19:18;22:15;23:13-14;29:17)

## Advice to children
##Ushauri kwa watoto

Children are told to respect their parents (20:20), but unfortunately many children do not (30:11–14). Watoto wanaambiwa wawatii wazazi wao(20:20),lakini kwa bahati mbaya wengi hawafanyi hivyo(30:11-14)They are told to listen to their parents (6:20–22; 15:5),Wanaambiwa wawasikilize wazazi wao(6:20-22;15:5)because all parents were once young themselves and they learned these things from their experiences (1:8–9; 3:1–2; 4:1–4; 13:1).Kwasababu wazazi wote mwanzo walikuwa watoto pia na walijifunza vitu hivi katika maisha yao ya kawaida(1:8-9;3:1-2;4:1-4;13:1). Children are warned that taking advantage of parents is the same as stealing (28:24).Watoto wanaonywa kwamba aibaye mali ya babaye au mamaye na kusema si kosa kwavile ni wazazi ni sawa na kuiba(28:24)

The choices of children can hurt the parents. If a child is disobedient and sinful, they can be a burden to their parents (10:1) and they can bring shame to them (19:26; 28:7). Maamuzi ya watoto yanaweza kuwaumiza wazazi.Kama mtoto si mtii na anafanya dhambi,wanaweza kuwa mzigo kwa wazazi wao(10:1) na wanaweza kuwaletea aibu (19:26;28:7).See also Proverbs 15:20, 17:21, and 17:25.Angalia pia mithali 15:20,17:21, na 17:25. But obedient children can be a blessing to their father and mother (23:22–25; 27:11; 29:3).Bali watoto watii wanaweza kuwa Baraka kwa baba na mama(23:22-25;27:11;29:3)

## Advice to the single
## Ushauri kwa ambao hawajaoa na kuolewa

There are more verses in Proverbs that talk about single people than married people.Kuna mistari mingi katika mithali inayozungumza kuhusu watu ambao hawajaoa na kuolewa kuliko wale waliooana. This is because these words were originally written as a father to his son, who was probably young and unmarried.Hii ni kwasababu maneno haya yaliandikwa kama baba na mtoto,ambaye alikuwa kwanza mdogo na hajaoa. We would be wise to teach these same words to our children. Tunaweza kutumia hekima kuwafundisha watoto wetu maneno hayahaya.You may be married, but these words are still important because you can teach them to your children and grand children.Unaweza ukawa umeoa au kuolewa  lakini maneno haya bado ni ya muhimu kwako kwani unaweza kuwafundisha watoto wako na wajukuu.

### It is a good thing to be married and have children
### Ni jambo zuri kuolewa au kuoa na kupata watoto

Proverbs talks about the blessings of marriage (18:22; 31:10) and having children (17:6).
Mithali inazungumza kuhusu Baraka za ndoa(18:22;31:10) na kupata watoto(17:6)

### But it can also be a bad thing
### Lakini inaweza pia kuwa kitu kibaya

There's at least six verses in Proverbs that warn about marrying the wrong person (17:1; 19:13; 21:9, 19; 25:24), but many times they are not emphasized. Instead we only talk about how "a man that findeth a wife findeth a good thing."Kuna kama mistari sita katika mithali inayoonya kuhusu kuoa au kuolewa na mtu asiye sahihi(17:1;19:13;21:9,19;25:24)

Why all these negative verses only about a bad wife? What about bad husbands? Again, Proverbs was written to teach sons.Kwanini mistari hasi imelengwa tu kwa mwanamke mbaya?Vipi kuhusu waume wabaya?Tena,Mithali iliandikwa kufundisha wanaume. It was warning them about who they should marry. Ilikuwa inawaonya kuhusu  waoe nani.We could assume that if the book was written to daughters, that there would be plenty of warnings against bad husbands.Tungeweza kudhani kwamba kama kitabu hiki kingeandikwa kwaajili ya mabinti,basi kungekuwa na maonyo mengi dhidi ya waume.

### Be careful who you give your affection to
###Kuwa makini na Yule unayechagua kumpa upendo wako

Some people will speak affectionate and flattering words, Baadhi ya watu wanaweza kuzungumza maneno ya upendo nay a kujipendekeza,but their hearts and intentions are not right (5:1–4).Lakini mioyo yao na nia zao siyo sahihi(5:1-4). Chapter 31 gives characteristics of a good wife. Sura ya 31 sifa za mwanamke bora.These are the things that we need to teach our children to look for in a potential spouse.Hivi ni vitu ambavyo tunahitaji kuwafundisha watoto wetu kuangalia kwa wenzi.

### Let God help you find a spouse
Mruhusu Mungu akusaidie kumpata mwenzi

Some preachers will quote Proverbs 18:22 and say that we have to actively and diligently search for a wife, but we have to remember that God is ultimately the one that will provide a good wife (19:14).Wahubiri wachache watanukuu mithali 18:22 na kusema kwamba tunatakiwa kutia bidii na nguvu kutafuta mke,lakini tunatakiwa kukumbuka kwamba Mungu pekee ndiye atakayempa mtu mke mwema (19:14).
