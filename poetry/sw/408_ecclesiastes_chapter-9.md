# Death, life, and evil times (chapter 9)
# Kifo, maisha, na nyakati za maovu (sura ya 9)

## The despair of death (v. 1-6)
## Kukata tama kwaajili ya kifo (mst. 1-6)

The righteous, and the wise, and their works, are **in the hand of God**. Qohelet observes that **all people** die, no matter who they are or what they have done. "To all appearances, God is just not interested. The things that are supposed to matter most to Him turn out to make no difference—or none that anyone can see—to the way we are disposed of in the end. Moral or immoral, religious or profane, we are all mown down alike."[1]Haki, na hekima na kazi zao, viko katika **Mikono ya Mungu**. Koheleti anachunguza kwamba **watu wote** hufa, haijalishi wao ni nani au wamefanya nini. "Katika muonekano wote,Mungu hafurahii.Vitu vinavyojalisha kwake vinakuwa havina tofauti-au hakina ambacho mtu anaweza kuona_katika njia ya kuelekea mwisho.Maadili au isiyo na maadili, kidini au kidunia, wote tunakunja uso chini kufanana."[1]

## The hope of life (v. 7-10)
## Tumaini la maisha (mst. 7-10)

He then says that we may all die, but we should still enjoy life while we have it. He also says that we should work hard. "Man was not created to be idle, he was not elected to be idle, he was not redeemed to be idle, he was not quickened to be idle, and he is not sanctified by God's grace to be idle."[2] Baada ya hayo anasema kwamba wote tunaweza kufa, lakini ni lazima tuendelee kufurahia maisha wakati tukiwa nayo. Pia anasema kwamba tunatakiwa tufanye kazi kwa bidii. "Mwanadamu hakuumbwa akae bure, hakuchaguliwa akae bure, hakukombolewa ili akae bure, hajapewa uhai ili akae bure, na hajatakaswa kwa Neema ya Mungu ili akae bure. "[2]

## The mystery of time and chance (v. 11-18)
## Siri ya ajabu ya muda na nafasi (mst. 11-18)

### Taken in an evil time (v. 11-12)
### Imechukuliwa katika muda wa uovu (mst. 11-12)

No amount of wisdom or skill appears to prevent the evil time. Bad things happen as a result of humanity’s choices; as a result of sin and forsaking God. But none of them happen "accidentally" or apart from God’s will.Hakuna kiwango cha hekima au ujuzi unaojitokeza kuepuka muda wa uovu.Mambo mabaya yanatokea kama matokeo ya maamuzi ya utu;kama matokeo ya dhambi na kumuacha Mungu.Lakini hakuna linalotokea "kwa bahati mbaya"au mbali na mapenzi ya Mungu.

### Wisdom is better, but it is often wasted (v. 13-18)
### Hekima ni bora, lakini siku zote hupuuzwa (mst. 13-18)

Qohelet tells the story of a wise man that saved his city, but was soon forgotten. He says that wisdom is better than many things, but it is not always beneficial because it is not heard. Koheleti anatoa hadithi ya mtu mwenye hakima aliyeokoa jiji lake, lakini alisahaulika mapema.Anasema kwamba hekima ni bora kuliko vitu vingi, lakini siyo mara zote una faida kwasababu haisikiki.
