# Introduction to the Book of Proverbs

## Proverbs is not just a random collection of sayings

Proverbs has two major sections (1-9 & 10-31), that compose seven different collections (1:1; 10:1; 22:17; 24:23; 25:1; 30:1; 31:1).

The first nine chapters are longer poems that deal with subjects in depth, and the rest of the book is composed of individual sentence sayings.

## Proverbs is of the wisdom genre

Not every passage in the Bible is read the same. For example we read Acts 17:1 differently than we read Psalm 18:8. The first is an historical account of events, and the second is poetic and symbolic description of God. God does not literally have smoke coming out of His nose (He does not actually have a nose, either, since He is a spirit). The same way, we do not read Proverbs the same way we would Leviticus or one of the prophets.

Before we talk about what makes a proverb unique, let's look at two verses of Proverbs that confuse some people:

Why are these two Proverbs contradicting each other?

### Proverbs are different than laws

A law is always the same. It does not change based on circumstances. Proverbs are different from laws because at some times they are good to follow, but at other times it is not wise to obey it. We need wisdom to know when to obey a Proverb. 

### Proverbs are different than promises

Proverbs 22:6 says that if you teach your children the right way, then they will never leave that way. But what does it mean if my children leave church? Why do some virtuous women have abusive husbands or disrespectful children? (Prov. 31:28)

Proverbs is part of the biblical canon and also part of a collection of wisdom books. Reading the other wisdom books can give us insight about the application of Proverbs to life.

In the book of Job, which is another wisdom book, Job's friends believe in a _retribution theology_, which means they believed that bad things only happen to bad people, and good things only happen to good people. Since Job's life was full of bad things, they thought that he must be a really bad sinner. But we know from the story in chapters 1 and 2, that these events in Job's life were not because of sin.

The preacher in Ecclesiastes 1:12–17 and the writer of Psalm 73 lament because the foolish and wicked seem to live good lives.

If proverbs are not laws or promises, than what are they?

### Proverbs are principles

> Promises are always fulfilled 100 percent of the time. Principles state general truths.

We still obey these principles, even though we may not see the exact results that we hope for.

> On what grounds, then, could the sages so confidently assert the superiority of righteousness even though they were aware of righteous folk who suffered and of wicked folk who prospered? _In general_, the sages clearly believed that wise and righteous behavior did make life better and richer, though virtue did not _guarantee_ those consequences.
> Van Leeuwan, Hebrew Studies 33, pg. 32

> It is a mistake, though, to treat the proverb as a type of guarantee. That is not what proverbs do. Again, it is a genre issue. Proverbs are not in the business of giving promises. Rather, they encourage people toward attitudes and actions that will lead toward a desired goal, all other things being equal. It is more likely that a child will grow up to be wise if their parents train them in the Lord’s way. But perhaps that child will come under the negative influence of his or her peers (see, for instance, the advice given in 1:8-19).
> —Tremper Longman, III

Job's friends and the preacher of Ecclesiastes may have had a wrong understanding of applying principles like these, but that does not make the principles wrong.

> The widespread dogmatic misuse of retributive sayings or concepts (Job 42:7; Luke 13:1-5; John 9:1-2; cf. Prov 26:7, 9) does not itself render the sayings dogmatic.
> Raymond C. Van Leeuwan, WEALTH AND POVERTY: SYSTEM AND CONTRADICTION IN PROVERBS, Hebrew Studies vol. 33 pg. 29

#### A proverb needs wisdom for proper application

##### Wisdom for the right time

Ecclesiates teaches that there is a time for everything (3:1-8).

##### Wisdom for right circumstances

The contrasting ideas found in Proverbs are not contradictions, but they provide a balanced understanding of wisdom that applies to the varieties of life situations.

Proverbs 18:22 says that he that "findeth a wife findeth a good thing," but 21:9 says that "It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, Than with a brawling woman in a wide house." So marriage is good... but only if you marry the right person.

A proverb used wrongly can be dangerous. Proverbs 27:5 says that "Open rebuke is better than secret love", but that does not mean that we should rebuke every person every time we think they are doing something wrong.

No single verse of Scripture gives us a complete view on any one subject. Compare one proverb with other proverbs and other Scriptures to get a better understanding of it.

We have to read Proverbs with an understanding that there are things in life that are complicated. From the proverbs we see that "The blessing of the LORD makes rich" (10:22) and also that "Violent men get riches" (11:16).

#### Just because a proverb says something is better than something else, does not mean that the thing compared is inherently bad

God will at times bless people with riches, but there are other blessings that He gives that are better than riches.

> These "better-than" sayings set material wealth and poverty in an ultimate normative context which utterly reverses their usual worth. In a nutshell, poverty with righteousness is "better than" wealth with wickedness. Proverbs consistently insists that righteousness outweighs wealth, and wickedness renders wealth worthless. Wealth which may _appear_ as a blessing of the Creator is not intrinsically and invariably good. That depends upon whether wealth is subordinate to righteousness, justice, and wisdom. Material goods must be placed in a normative context which relates them one to another and prevents any particular good from becoming absolute at the expense of the norms which order and limit them all.
> Van Leeuwan, Hebrew Studies 33 pg. 31

> The editor-sages who structured Proverbs sought first to teach these basic "rules of life," thus the heavy emphasis on character-consequence patterns in both Proverbs 1–9 and 10–15. We must first learn the basic rules; the exceptions can come later.
> Van Leeuwan, Hebrew Studies 33 pg. 32

#### There is injustice in the world

* The poor do not have food because of thieves (13:23; 30:14)
* Violent men get riches (11:16)
* Wicked people rule (29:2)
* Fools live in luxury (19:10)
* People get rich by lying (21:6)
* People ignore those that are in need (28:7; 21:13)

The source of this injustice is because we live in a fallen world (unlike the plan God had in Eden).

There may be injustice now, but God will judge in the end:

See also 10:2; 11:4, 7, 18, 21, 23, 28;  12:7, 12; 15:25; 17:5; 19:17; 20:21; 21:6–7, 13; 22:8–9, 16; 24:20; 28:8, 10, 20, 22, 27.

We do not always see the fulfillment of judgment in this life, and so we must use faith, or "trust in the LORD with all [our] heart[s]" (3:5–6). This leads us to discus the spiritual nature of the book.

## Proverbs is a spiritual book

It is true that Proverbs deals with a lot of practical things in life, but true wisdom is more than just knowledge or emotional intelligence.

To Solomon, wisdom does not begin with a natural education, but it comes from God. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge (1:7). Solomon himself got his wisdom by asking God (1 Kings 3:5–12).

A constant reason for behaving righteously is because God hates wickedness and loves righteousness (11:1; 12:2, 15:8–9; 17:15; 20:10, 23; 21:3, 27; 28:9).

## Proverbs is written in a poetic form

### Parallelism

The central characteristic of Hebrew poetry is parallelism, which is like a rhyming of ideas.

#### Synomous parallelism

This is when the second line repeats the idea in the first using slightly different language. It is for narrowing the thought or making it sharper. For example:

#### Antithecal parallelism

The second line contrasts the first, as in:

A lot of sayings in chapters 10-15 are like this.

#### Sythetic parallelism (sometimes called step parallelism)

The second line continues the thought of the first line by addition.

### Anologies

Proverbs uses a lot of symbolism or examples from natural life to illustrate and explain truth. Some of these are similies, which is a comparison of two things using _like_ or _as_, as in the following example:

There are two in-depth uses of symbolism used throughout the first nine chapters that depict both wisdom and folly.

#### Woman Wisdom

She speaks in Proverbs 1:20-33 and chapter 8. She is also mentioned in 9:1-6, 11; 2:3-4; 4:7-9; 6:22; 7:4.

* She keeps good friends
  * righteousness (8:6)
  * truth (8:7)
  * prudence (8:12)
  * common sense (8:14-15)
* She stays away from bad company 
  * deception
  * evil
  * pride
  * arrogance (8:7-8, 13)
* She was one of the first things created (8:22-26, 8:30-31, 3:19)
* She does not tolerate rejection (1:24-27)

#### Woman Folly

She is mentioned in chapter 9:13-18.

She is similar to the Strange Woman (5:8 and 7:22 are like 9:13-18. And 2:18-19, 5:5, and 7:27 are like 9:18). Both women start by calling out to the simple (9:4, 16). Both desire a relationship (come in with me). Both have prepared a meal (9:1-2, 17).

###### Path of life

There is a good way and a bad way.

There are snares and dangers in the way.

## Proverbs was written as advice from a father to his son

Writings of advice from a father to a son were common in the ancient near east.

A surface reading the Proverbs and all its warnings about the "strange" women can give the impression that only women have issues with promiscuity, but when we remember that it was written to a young man then it makes sense of why the warnings are against people of the opposite gender. We could safely assume that if it was written by a mother to her daughter that there would be plenty of warnings of the "strange" man.
