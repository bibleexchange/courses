# Psalms of Zion

## Introduction

Psalms of Zion extol Zion, or Jerusalem, for its exalted role as the abode of God’s glory and as the religious and political capital of the nation. They are 15, 24, 46, 48, 50, 76, 81, 84, 87, and 122.

## Pilgrim Psalms

The Pilgrim Psalms are sometimes included with the Psalms of Zion as they do not really constitute a distinct literary type of their own. Pilgrim Psalms or Song of Ascents is a title given to fifteen of the Psalms, 120–134, each starting with the ascription **Shir Hama'aloth** (literally meaning "to go up to"). They are also called Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, or Songs of Steps.

Four of these psalms (122, 124, 131 and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one to Solomon (127). Psalms of Ascents were sung by pilgrims journeying up to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.

## Zion

### The city of David

David Took the Stronghold of Zion which was the easternmost of the two hills of ancient Jerusalem (2 Samuel 5:6–10). David had pitched a tent for the Ark of the Covenant in 1 Chronicles 15. When Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem, the meaning of Zion expanded further to include the temple area (1 Kings 8:1). In the Old Testament, Zion is used as a name for the city of Jerusalem (Isaiah 40:9), the land of Judah (Jeremiah 31:12), and the nation of Israel as a whole (Zechariah 9:13).

### The city of God

The word _Zion_ occurs over 150 times in the Bible. The word Zion is also used in a spiritual sense in Scripture. In the New Testament, Zion refers to God’s spiritual kingdom. We have not come to Mount Sinai, says the apostle, but "mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem" (Hebrews 12:22). Just as King David was a temporal version of the eternal King, Jesus Christ, the "city of David" was a temporal shadow of the eternal and spiritual city, Zion, where Christ will reign. Zion is contrasted with Babylon in Psalm 137:1.
