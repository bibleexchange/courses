## The trial continues (chapter 2)
## Jaribu linaendelea (Mlango wa 2)

As if the current losses are not enough, Satan asks for one more torture to place on Job in hopes of making him crack.Kama vile vile alivyopoteza sasa havitoshi, Shetani anauliza kuhusu teso lingine la kumnasa Ayubu.At this point, it hurts to hear Satan ask for this and it hurts for God to allow it.Katika jambo hili,inaumiza kusikia shetani akiuliza kuhusu hili na inaumiza kuona Mungu anaruhusu. Our reaction reveals that we usually have a man-centered view of life rather than a God centered view.Mwitikio  wetu unafunua  kuwa mara nyingi  tuna misimamo yetu tu ya maisha na siyo mitizamo iliyojengwa Ki Mungu.. If God is good, then how can He allow these things to happen to Job? If we stand on the biblical truth that God is good, then we must believe that there is a greater purpose for His actions when they appear hurtful. Kama Mungu ni mzuri,basi anawezaje kuruhusu mambo hayo yampate Ayubu?Kama tutasimama katika ukweli wa biblia kuwa Mungu ni mzuri,basi lazima tuamini kuwa kuna lengo kuu la matendo yake yanapokuwa yanaumiza.The problem is we try to find a greater purpose for His actions that benefit Job, and in our own trials we look for a greater purpose that ultimately suits us.Tatizo ni kwamba tunajaribu kutafuta lengo kuu la kutenda kwake ambazo zinamfaidisha Ayubu,na katika majaribu yetu tunaangalia lengo kuu ambalo linatupendeza. All this thinking is man centered. It is possible that we must suffer for God to receive sufficient glory and honor? Is it possible that the best overall outcome includes our suffering? This is taught clearly in the Bible (Philippians 1:29).Mawazo yote haya ni ya kibinadamu.Ni rahisi kuwa lazima tuteseke kwaajili ya Mungu ili kupokea utukufu wa kutosha na heshima? Inaweza kuwa rahisi kuwa matokeo yote mazuri zaidi yanahusisha mateso yetu? Job forces us to realize that the word “good” used as an attribute of God must mean something different then what is convenient or pleasing to us as men.Ayubu anatulazimisha kugundua kuwa neno  “mema”lilitumika kama sifa ya Mungu lazima limaanishe kitu tofauti halafu kipi kinasadiki au kinatufurahisha kama wanadamu. God-centered thinking places man low enough to be used by God at His will and for His glory to produce the best possible outcome.Mawazo ya KiMungu yanampa mtu unyenyekevu wa kutosha kuweza kutumiwa na Mungu kwa utukufu wake na kwa mapenzi yake kuzaa matokeo bora. Practically speaking, the God-centered Christian life is the pursuit of God in such a way that we desire be changed by Him for his purpose and glory. Tukizungumza kwa vitendo,Maisha ya mkristo anayefuata uongozi wa Mungu ni harakati za Mungu katika njia kwamba tunatamani kubadilishwa nayeye kwa lengo lake na utukufu wake.The man-centered Christian life is that by works and prayer we change the will of God so that we benefit from his goodness in the way that is most pleasing to us.Maisha ya mkristo wa mwilini ni kwamba kwa kazi na maombi tunabadili mapenzi ya Mungu ili kwamba tufaidike katika mema yake katika njia ambayo inatufurahisha. The latter is also the goal of all pagan religions and is why idolatry is the primary sin of the whole Bible. We do not like God so we change Him. Mwisho pia ni lengo la wapagani wote na ni kwanini ibada ya sanamu ni  dhambi ya msingi  katika biblia nzima.

Chapter 2 concludes with seven days of silence. Jobs body is covered in boils, he has resisted bad advice from his wife, and three of his friends have come to comfort and morn with him. Seven days with no words! The following chapters will prove that in those seven days Job and his friends did plenty of thinking. Each have their own questions and answers.Mlango wa 2 unamalizia na siku 2 za ukimya.Mwili wa Ayubu umejaa majipu,alikataa ushauri mbaya toka kwa mke wake,na rafiki zake watatu walikuja kumtia moyo na kuhuzunika naye.Siku saba bila maneno!Milango inayofuata itathibitisha kuwa katika siku hizo saba Ayubu na rafiki zake walikuwa na mawazo mengi.Kila mmoja alikuwa na maswali yake na majibu.
