# JOB
##AYUBU

## Introduction
## Utangulizi

Job is thought by some to have lived around the time of Abraham. Job was wealthy and righteous.Baadhi ya watu wanafikiria kuwa Ayubu aliishi wakati wa Abrahamu. He was tried and survived.Ayubu alikuwa tajiri na mwenye haki. The book is often reduced to a simple overview such as "A Godly man tried by fire who maintained his integrity" or "a man who lost it all but was given twice as much because he held to God.Kitabu hiki mara nyingi kilifupishwa katika maelezo marahisi kama vile “Mtu wa Mungu aliyejaribiwa kwa moto aliyetunza uadilifu wake” au mwanadamu aliyepoteza yote lakini alipewa mara mbili ya vile kwasababu alimshika Mungu." But a closer look will reveal that Job addresses issues much beyond these. “Lakini ukitazama kwa mbali utapata ufunuo kwamba Ayubu alifanya  mambo mengi zaidi ya haya. It is one of the only Old Testament books to mention Satan, it explores the relationship between God and Satan, God and man, and man and Satan as well as the relationship of good and evil.Ni mojawapo ya vitabu vya agano la kale kumtaja shetani,inachunguza uhusiano kati ya Mungu na Shetani,Mungu na mwanadamu,na mwanadamu na shetani pamoja na uhusiano wa mema na maovu. It draws boundaries on what can and cannot happen to a godly person.Inaonyesha mipaka ya kipi kifanyike na kipi kisifanyike kwa mtu wa Mungu. It makes us consider the depth of the character of God and even question his goodness and sovereignty. Inatufanya sisi kufikiria kwa kina cha sifa ya Mungu na pia kuuliza uzuri wake na uhuru.In the end it brings the reader to a sobering view of themselves, and while Job is rescued from his trial the reader is left left wrestling in his mind.Mwisho anamleta msomaji katika fikra ya kutisha kuwahusu,na wakati Ayubu aliokolewa kutoka katika jaribu lake msomaji aliachwaakishindana katika akili yake. The book of Job is a difficult book to understand, but it rewards the careful reader with hours of godly reflection sending us back to the scriptures to find the answers.Kitabu cha Ayubu ni kitabu kigumu kuelewa,lakini inamlipa msomaji kwa masaa ya ya kumfikiria Mungu akitupeleka nyuma katika andiko kupata majibu.

### Obstacles to understanding the book
### Vizuizi vya kuelewa kitabu.

The Book of Job has a few obstacles that will keep us from understanding its deepest messages. We must start by naming some of them so we do not get off track as we study.Kitabu cha Ayubu kina vikwazo vichache vitakavyotufanya tuelewe ujumbe wa ndani.Lazima tuanze kwa kutaja baadhi yake hivyo hatutakuwa nje tunaposoma.

1. The Book is not about wealth. The wealth that Job has at the beginning and the end are seasons of grace and God was not required to give either. They display God’s affection for Job but they must take a back seat in our study. If the whole subject of wealth were removed the central theme would remain intact. Remember Job himself never once cried over the cattle.Kitabu hiki siyo kwaajili ya utajiri.Utajiri aliokuwa nao Ayubu mwanzo na mwisho ni sababu ya neeme na Mungu hakuitaji kutoa chochote.Zinaonyesha upendo wa Mungu kwa Ayubu lakini lazima wachukue nafasi ya nyuma katika kujifunza kwetu.Kama somo lote la utajiri lingeondolewa wazo la kati lingebaki bila kuharibika.Kumbuka Ayubu mwenyewe hakuwahi kulia juu ya mifugo.
2. Job is not a place we go to study didactic text in search of doctrine. The narrative is an honest representation of the dialog of Job and his friends. To dig for doctrine in the oratory will lead us down the wrong road. We should rather step back and identity the overall movements that are taking place.Ayubu siyo eneo tunaloenda kusoma nakala za mafundisho Fulani.Hadithi ni mwakilishi mwaminifu cha kibali cha Ayubu na rafiki zake.Kuchimba mafundisho katika hotuba itatuongoza katika barabara mbaya.Tunatakiwa  kurudi nyuma na kugundua mwenendo wa jumla ambao unachukua nafasi.
3. Don’t give up. The people talk a long time and say many things, and it is easy to lose focus if we forget the main purpose of the book.Usikate tama.Watu wanaongelea muda mrefu na kusema vitu vingi,na ni rahisi kupoteza muelekeo kama tukisahau lengo kuu la kitabu.
4. God does not change. The account causes such strong feelings of injustice at times that we begin to make excuses for Gods actions or allow God’s attributes to shift to make events easier to swallow.Mungu habadiliki.Maelezo haya yanasababisha hisia za nguvu za kutokutenda haki kwa nyakati ambazo tunaanza kutoa sababu kwa Mungu au kuruhusu sifa za Mungu kubadilisha matukio marahisi kumeza.
