# The psalms of enthronement

## Introduction

The **psalms of enthronement** contain the expression “the Lord reigns” (or, in the case of Psalm 98, “the Lord, the King”), and speak of the rule of God over all the earth. He is "kingly" to the greatest extant. A king reigns, has domimion and a good king is the joy of His people. These psalms are 47, 93, 95–99.

The majority of these come after 89, which expresses discouragement about the ending of the kingship of Israel. These psalms show that even though the earthly kingdom may fail, the heavenly kingdom will never fail.

God is the king of Israel, but He is also king over the heathen (47:8) and over all the earth (47:2). He is above all other gods (97:7–9).

## The Lord is sovereign in righteousness and justice

> Where there is no injustice, there is little need to speak of justice. The frequency of the topic of justice in these psalms would therefore suggest that they were intended to deal with circumstances where injustice had become rife.

Psalm 97:2 says that, "righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne." His righteousness has been not only revealed to the Israelites, but it has also be shown to the heathen (98:2).

## The Lord is sovereign in creation

God made everything. He made the sea, land (95:5), and the heavens (96:5). He also created humans, so we must worship Him (95:6). He alone is Creator. All the other gods are just idols that have been created by man (96:5).

God has power over creation. The earth moves (99:1), the earth trembles (97:4), and the hills melt like wax (97:5) before the power of God. All of His creation praises Him. The heavens rejoice (96:11), the earth is glad (96:11) and rejoices (97:1), the field is joyful (96:12), all the trees of the wood rejoice (96:12), the multitude of isles are glad (97:1), the heavens declare his righteousness (97:6), the floods clap their hands (98:8), and the hills are joyful (98:8) because of what God has done.

## The Lord is sovereign in judgment

His judgment is righteous and based on the truth (96:10, 13), which means that it is good and fair judgment. He judges all people, not just the Israelites (96:13). The purpose of His judgment is to bring equity (99:4).

Psalm 47:2 says that God is **terrible**. (See also 45:4; 65:5; 66:3, 5; 68:35; 76:12; 99:3; 106:22.) What does it mean that God is terrible? "The terror of the Lord" speaks of the reverence or fear inspired by the thought that God is judge (2 Corinthians 5:10–11).

## The Lord is the sovereign king of the future

There is a forward-looking aspect in 98:9. It is looking forward in time to when the kingdom of God will be fully manifested.
