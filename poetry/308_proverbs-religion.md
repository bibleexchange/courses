Proverbs does not mention the Covenant or Israel. So some people do not believe that the writers believed in the Israelite religion ( https://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/otesources/20-proverbs/text/articles/waltke_provtheology_bsac.htm pg 302-303)

> Rankin likewise concluded, "We have no reason to assume, in the absence of actual evidence, that at any time there was in Israel a purely secular proverb literature From the very outset in Israel's wisdom writings the religious sanction of right conduct, the motive supplied by the idea of God's blessing and cursing was present."

> Although some scholars have urged that the older strata of Hebrew wisdom was purely secular, it is difficult to conceive that a movement so broadly based in Hebrew society and so penetrating of the meaning of lifecould be purely secular, even in its most pragamtic form. The religious and the secular in the ancient Near East had an inseperable relationship.

> In general... God does not communicate in wisdom literature quite so intimately as He does through the prophets. Rather His mode of self-revelation assumes the medium of human reason and nature. It falls in the broad range of what we now call "natural revelation." Yet we should not erroneously conclude that "special revelation" is not involved, since it definitely stands as the backdrop for human reason and natural observation. That is, man is not left aloof to figure out the universe apart from God.

## Wisdom comes from God

Proverbs 2:6 (KJV 1900)
      6       For the LORD giveth wisdom:
      Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.

## Prayer

## Fear of the Lord

On the Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge on chapter 1:

> Wisdom grounds moral education in a knowledge of God. The poem discloses this substructure, quoting one of the most repeated lines in the book: “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge.”11 That the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom means that without this relationship one will never acquire true wisdom. This “beginning” is not in the horizontal sense of missing the first tire in an obstacle course and just skipping to the next. Rather it is in the vertical sense of a ladder. If the student misses the first step of the ladder then progress cannot be made to the next step. What the letters of the alphabet are to reading and notes to music, the fear of the Lord is to wisdom.
> Proverbs and the Fromation of Character

> In our modern spirituality, “fear” is not typically a stance toward God which is advocated regularly from the pulpits. Nevertheless, Proverbs makes clear that the fear of the Lord is the essence of wisdom. At its most basic level, fearing the Lord means that the center of life is not our world; it is located beyond.14 To fear God is to realize that there is a moral locus outside of the self—a message which ought to be sounded from the pulpits. The beginning of wisdom is to come to the realization that fulfillment and satisfaction are outside our own power.
> Proverbs and the Fromation of Character

> Chapter Eight identifies God as the most fundamental resource for character formation. This chapter highlights what is referred to as the “Yahweh proverbs” in order to better understand the sages’ perspective on God’s involvement in human life. Yahweh is the ever-present, underlying force at work that initiates and sustains the educational process. The God of the sages does not remain aloof, watching from a distance as events unfold in the life of people. God does not sporadically intervene with a miracle here or there. Nor does the Lord display a cloud by day or a pillar of fire by night so that the people know which direction to go. Instead, the sages’ God is involved in the details of daily living, working behind the scenes in the experiences and actions of creation. Yahweh works through human thoughts and decisions, all the while honoring the choices individuals make for themselves. Through such intricate and lovingly patient work, God shapes the character and will of those who remain open to learning.

?? How many times is Lord used in Proverbs? https://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/otesources/20-proverbs/text/articles/waltke_provtheology_bsac.htm pg 304 says that it is 84 times.

> Becker concluded from his study of this term in the Law that the fear of the Lord denotes “reverence of Yahweh and the special aspect of loyalty to Him as the covenant God.”

> In contrast to love which denotes a spontaneous commitment out of appreciation, fear denotes a commitment out of awe and respect. This fear is not the numinous dread of a moment, but a lifetime stance of submission in reverent awe. Such an attitude is an essential spiritual condition of the heart if a man hopes to have a personal relationship with a God whose name and deeds are "terrible" (Exod. 34:10; Deut. 4:34; 28:58; Mal. 1:15; 3:23) and who is "great" and "holy" (2 Sam. 7:27; 1 Chron. 16:25; Ps. 99:3; 145:6).

> The phrase "the fear of the Lord" presents a paradox in both the prophetic and the sapiential literature: It is at one and the same time both the source and the substance, the cause and the effect. On the one hand, the term denotes the spiritual prerequisite for all ethical behavior, namely, a commitment to God out of awesome reverence for Him. On the other hand, it denotes the objective content of that which He demands through His spokesman whether it be the priest with the law, or the prophet with the word, or the wise man with his counsel (cf. Jer. 18:18). Thus the sage promised, "My son, if you accept my words...then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God" (Prov. 2:1-5). Stähli noted that in Proverbs "the fear of the Lord" is a close parallel to terms for wisdom and can almost be used as a synonym for knowledge (1:29; 2:5; cf. Isa. 11 :2; 33:6; Job 28:28).46 In Deuteronomy and the prophetic literature the fear of the Lord is both taught and learned (Deut. 31:12; 2 Kings 17:7, 25, 28, 32-39, 41).

> …the Book of Proverbs is in the biblical canon not because it contains ethical values similar to those demanded by pagan sages but because Yahweh encounters the faithful in it with His commandments to fear Him and to love man made in His image.

!! Turn the following quote into a table:

> Also the wise men ascribe the same attributes and actions to Yahweh as those ascribed to him by the prophets. According to both circles He is the Creator of the cosmos (Deut. 10:14; Isa. 40:21-22; Prov. 3:19-20) and of all mankind (Deut. 4:32; Isa. 42:5; Prov. 14:31; 29:13). He is the same living God who will avenge wrong (Deut. 32:35, 40-41; Nahum 1:2; Prov. 25:21-22) and the same spiritual Being who comforts men and knows man's ways (Deut. 23:14; Jer. 16:17; Provo 5:21; 15:3). According to both, He is the sovereign Lord directing history (Deut. 4:19; 29:4, 26; Isa. 45:1-13; Prov. 16:1-9, 33; 19:21; 20:24 et passim) and is yet present in it, withholding and giving rain (Deut. 11:13-17; Hag. 1:10-11; Prov 3:9-10), disciplining His children (Deut. 8:5; Isa. 1:4-6; Prov. 3:11-12), and in His mercy answering their prayers (Deut. 4:29-31; Isa. 56:7; Prov. 15:8,29). According to both sources He is merciful (Deut. 4:31; 30:8; Isa. 63:7; Prov 28:13), wise (Deut. 4:26; Isa. 11:2-3; 31:2; Prov. 8:22-31), delights in justice and hates iniquity (Deut. 10:17; Isa. 1:16-17; Prov 11:1; 17:15), and has aesthetic-ethical sensibilities (Deut. 22:4-11; 23:10-14; Jer. 32:35; Prov. 3:32; 6:16-19; 11:20; 15:9 et passim).

## Righteousness

## Sin/wickedness

## Cult

## Blessing and cursing??

<!--
> It is specifically ethical-religious wisdom that the Book of Proverbs discusses and recomends. This wisdom is exclusively functional; its purpose is to get people to behave morally. In contrast to speculative wisdom, ethical-religious wisdom has little to do knowledge and understanding of life in the universe, insofar as that knowledge is not oriented to human behavior.
> Region in Proverbs p. 55

> What appears to be utilitarian ethic is really religious, if we consider conformity with the world order as part of the religious system.
> Region in Proverbs p. 62

(This thinking of the world order was likely influenced by Egyptian Maat.)

> God's part in retribution is remote. He is not the dynamic God of the rest of the Bible, but a remote sovereign who observes man's actions and and puts certain inflexible rules into opperation. Almost every aspect of God found elsewhere in the Bible is lacking: righteousness,, personal love, vivid wrath, control of history, covenent, msytery. The lack of mention of God's covenant with Israel or any special relation with Israel&mdash;or Isreal itself for that matter&mdash;is the shapest distinction between wisdom literature and the rest of the Bible. The world order is momogeneous; it applies equally to all men. There is no place for any special involvement of the remote God with a certain people. Since the world order is static, history is irrelevant in Israelite wisdom as in Egyptian thought. The wise-men think only of the enduring, constant, all-inclusive patterns of life.  
> Ethical-religious wisdom (Proverbs) is distinctly anthropocentric. God's will is relevant only insofar as it is part of the order and man must know it in order to be in harmony with the order. "The notion that the purpose of human life is to serve and glorify Yahweh is entirely absent."  
> Region in Proverbs p. 63

This quote is from what the author calls the first stage of wisdom literature, where Israelite wisdom is heavily influenced by Egyptain thinking. The problem is, the author does not give exact dates (and says that there are no exact dates) and he also does not show what divisions or verses of the book specifically fall into this category or what reasoning he has in emphatically declaring that there are really three stages in Proverbs. At first, I thought he was using Whybray's division of the first 9 chapters of Proverbsas his stage 1, but he also uses 2:6 as a part of the second stage. So it seems that he just picks and chooses which verses go into the stages that he layed out, without giving evidence of why the verse fit in that stage instead of others.
