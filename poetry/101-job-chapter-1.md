# Chapter 1: Job Was a Man Who Withstood a Severe Test

## God Had A Man Whose Name Was Job, vs. 1-5

> Job 1:1 ¶ There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.

### Job Was Known

- He lived in the Land of Uz.  No one really knows where Uz was located. (Maine is a state?)
- The name Job means: hated, persecuted

### Job is Reknown for his Uprightness

- He was Perfect and Upright (undefiled, pleasing to God)
- He Feared God and Eschewed(put away, remove, withdraw, be without) Evil

> Ezek. 14:12-14 &mdash; The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 13 Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it: 14 Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.

## Job is Reknown for his Patience

> James 5:11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
 
patience: cheerful (or hopeful) endurance, constancy:--enduring, patient waiting 

## Job is Known for Faithfully Sanctifying his Household, vs. 4-5

> Job 1:4 ¶ And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. **Thus did Job continually.**

Bringing attention to the spirit and not the theology of this. Job was an intercessor  and mediator.

## A Man Who Served God for Material Blessing?, vs. 6-12

> Job 1:6 ¶ Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. 7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? 9 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? 10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. 12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.

- "Whence comest thou?" What was satan looking for? It does not appear he found it. Another translation, "I am come from going round the earth to examine the works of the children of men; and from walking through it
- The Lord makes a suggestion, "Have you considered my servant Job." God is bringing attention to the good there is. God had a man named Job.
- In verse 9, Satan suggests that Job fears (morally reveres, reverances) God only because God has made it the only reasonable path Job could take. Satan suggests that Job's faith only goes as deep as his earthly blessings from God.  

This is interesting as material blessing often distracts one from their faith in God, but we can also observe that the removal of what was once in abundance does tempt anger.

The Severe test Job faced in Chapter one is designed to answer the question of the motivation for Job's faith and faithfulness.

## A Man Who was Stripped of All He Had, vs. 13-19

> Job 1:13 ¶ And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: 15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

A messenger came, another messenger, another and they were overtaken by a fourth messenger. 
1.  Sword
2.  Fire                                   
3.  Sword
4.  A Great Wind

v.14	The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
v.15	the Sabeans … took them away; yea, they have slain the servants 
v.16	burned up the sheep, and the servants
v.17	The Chaldeans… fell upon the camels…yea, and slain the servants 
v.19	a great wind.…smote … house, and … young men, and they are dead 

- This Test Was Unexpected (The usual was blessing)

Job received no warning of this test. (e.g., "There is going to be a test tomorrow.")

- This Test was Swift (overwhelming)

- This Test was Severe

- This was a Test

 1Pe 4:12 ¶ Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:
 
1 Peter 1:7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:

2Co 12:7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the   
           revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.

Isa 33:2 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every    
           morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
6 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: 
           the fear of the LORD is his treasure. 
1 Peter 5:9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.   
  
## A Man Who Blessed the Lord at All Times, vs. 20-22

> Job 1:20 ¶ Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 21 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. 22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

v.20	worshipped
v.21	blessed be the name of the LORD.
v.22	In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly

Job didn’t know that it was Satan causing all the trouble

2 Cor. 2:11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.

Pain inevitably afflicts each one of us. Suffering is unavoidable in this life. Will your relationship with God be enough when trials come?
