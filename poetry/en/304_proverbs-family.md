## What the book of Proverbs says about families

### Advice to parents

Proverbs teaches that parents should provide for their families (13:22; 31:13–15). It also tells parents that they should teach their children (22:6). The book of Proverbs is an example of this kind of teaching. The book itself is written as a father instructing his son.

We are to correct our children (29:15). If you love your children, you will correct them (13:24; 19:18; 22:15; 23:13–14; 29:17).

### Advice to children

Children are told to respect their parents (20:20), but unfortunately many children do not (30:11–14). They are told to listen to their parents (6:20–22; 15:5), because all parents were once young themselves and they learned these things from their experiences (1:8–9; 3:1–2; **4:1–4**; 13:1). Children are warned that taking advantage of parents is the same as stealing (28:24).

The choices of children can hurt the parents. If a child is disobedient and sinful, they can be a burden to their parents (10:1) and they can bring shame to them (19:26; 28:7). See also 15:20, 17:21, and 17:25. But obedient children can be a blessing to their father and mother (23:22–25; 27:11; 29:3).

### Advice to the single

There are more verses in Proverbs that talk about single people than married people. This is because these words were originally written as a father to his son, who was probably young and unmarried. We would be wise to teach these same words to our children. You may be married, but these words are still important because you can teach them to your children and grand children.

#### It is a good thing to be married and have children

Proverbs talks about the blessings of marriage (18:22; 31:10) and having children (17:6).

#### But it can also be a bad thing

There's at least six verses in Proverbs that warn about marrying the wrong person (17:1; 19:13; 21:9, 19; 25:24), but many times they are not emphasized. Instead we only talk about how "a man that findeth a wife findeth a good thing."

Why all these negative verses only about a bad wife? What about bad husbands? Again, Proverbs was written to teach sons. It was warning them about who they should marry. We could assume that if the book was written to daughters, that there would be plenty of warnings against bad husbands.

#### Be careful who you give your affection to

Some people will speak affectionate and flattering words, but their hearts and intentions are not right (5:1–6). Chapter 31 gives characteristics of a good wife. These are the things that we need to teach our children to look for in a potential spouse.

#### Let God help you find a spouse

Some preachers will quote Proverbs 18:22 and say that we have to actively and diligently search for a wife, but we have to remember that God is ultimately the one that will provide a good wife (19:14).
