## Chapters 1 & 2 "Under the Sun"

(Introduction, The Search, Conclusions)

> Ecclesiastes 1:1-3 &mdash; The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. 3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?

## Examples of Futility

Reflections on the monotonous routines of life. Life under the sun is meaningless and the writer gives some examples of futility:

1. Passing of Generations (v. 4)

Born to cease to exist?

2. Cycles of Nature (v. 5-7)

No real change.

3. Curiosity of Man (v. 8)

With the curiosity of man and all his efforts, the more he learns the more questions he raises.

4. Absence of Newness (v.9-11)

What a desire to find something new!

## Philosophies of Futility

Man has created philosophies of life to help him live/cope with this conclusion. The answer is not "there is no answer".

Those spiritully minded do not settle for "life is vain" but they search for meaning BEYOND this life. If the answer is not found beneath the sun, then it is found above the sun, beyond ourselves. 

For every need of man there is a corresponding satisfaction: hungry=food, etc. If we find a desire for which nothing in this world can satisfy, it is logical to assume we are made for another world.

> C.S. Lewis &mdash; "The Christian says, 'Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing."

## Acquiring Wisdom and Knowledge, (v. 12-18)

The search of the natural man for satisfaction and happiness. Solomon explains HOW he reached the conclusions stated:

> Ecclesiastes 1:12,13 &mdash; I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done UNDER HEAVEN: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.

Solomon also expresses what he had learned in his searching:

1. All lifestyles are meaningless (v.14)

2. Nothing Can be Changed (v. 15)

3. Knowledge is Useless (v. 16,17)

What Good has it done us?

4. Desire for Knowledge Brings Much Pain (v. 18) 

The current generation is a prime example of the vanity of just "more knowledge". "I've got all this knowledge and now I feel worse."

Why? You can't know what you need to know in order to produce peace, contentment, joy, etc.

Let's build high, let's fly, to the Moon, to Mars, etc. What have we discovered? More information on the PARTS and not explanation of the WHOLE. 

Solomon is not anti knowledge, but is concluding rigthly that Human knowledge without reference to God is NEVER SATISFYING.

## Worldly pleasure, (2:1-3)

## Art or agriculture (2:4-6)

## Great possessions (2:7-11)

## Conclusions:

- 2:12-21 Wise man is superior to the fool

- 2:24-26 "nothing better than to eat and drink and enjoy life."

Main Thought: Some answers will not be found here on Earth. They answers are found "beyond the sun" and are Spiritual in nature.

Under the sun, you will not find the answer why you are under the sun. The answer is BEYOND the sun.
