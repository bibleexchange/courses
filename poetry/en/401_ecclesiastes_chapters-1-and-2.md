## Under the sun (chapters 1–2)

In these two chapters, we have an introduction, the search for meaning in life, and some conclusions made from the search.

### Introduction by narrator (1:1–2)

### Examples of futility (1:3–11)

These are reflections on the monotonous routines of life. This helps us remember how small and insignificant we are compared to God. We have a beginning and an end, but God is eternal. The world will continue after we die.

#### Passing of generations (1:4)

Is man born only so he can later cease to exist?

#### Cycles of nature (1:5–7)

Nature is always repeating itself. There is no real, lasting change.

#### Curiosity of man (1:8)

With the curiosity of man and all his efforts, the more he learns the more questions he raises.

#### Absence of newness (1:9–11)

### The search for meaning (1:12–2:23)

For every need of man there is a corresponding satisfaction (hunger—food, etc.). If we find a desire for which nothing in this world can satisfy, it is logical to assume we are made for another world:

> The Christian says, 'Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing.  
> —C. S. Lewis

There is a heaven, but we are not there, yet. Ecclesiastes teaches us how to live in this current life that we have been given. While Christians have an understanding of heaven from the New Testament, there is no evidence that the Israelites had a complex doctrine of the afterlife in the Old Testament. So we should not be surprised that Qohelet focuses on this life that we live on earth.

Instead of always looking for more, we should learn to be thankful to God for the things that we have in this life.

#### Acquiring wisdom and knowledge (1:12–18)

The search of the natural man for satisfaction and happiness. Qohelet explains how he reached the conclusions stated in 1:12–13. Qohelet also expresses what he had learned in his searching:

1. All lifestyles are meaningless (1:14)
2. Nothing can be changed (1:15)
3. Knowledge is useless (1:16–17)
4. Desire for knowledge brings much pain (1:18)

Qohelet is not anti-knowledge, but he is concluding rightly that human knowledge without reference to God is **never satisfying**.

Ecclesiastes 1:18 says, "For in much wisdom is much grief." But many other places in the Bible say that wisdom helps in our life. Why does this say it differently? Wisdom does help in our lives, but it also brings a burden. For example, before the radio, we did not know about the problems in other parts of the world. Now we can know about wars and other problems in every corner of the globe. The book of Proverbs teaches us that thieves get rich and wicked people rule (Prov. 11:16)&mdash;this is the hard truth that wisdom teaches us.

#### Pleasure (2:1–3)

#### Art or agriculture (2:4–6)

#### Great possessions (2:7–11)

#### A wise man is superior to the fool (2:12–16)

Wisdom does excel foolishness, but wisdom cannot help you escape death.

#### Toil is meaningless (2:17-23)

### Conclusion (2:24–26)

> "nothing better than to eat and drink and enjoy life"
