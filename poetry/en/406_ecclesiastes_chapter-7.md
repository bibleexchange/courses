# Better and balanced living (chapter 7)

## Introduction to Chapter 7

In the remaining six chapters are a mixture of proverbs and narration designed to make the most of life "under the sun." In other words, while life under the sun is "vanity," how then should we live? Human Wisdom is limited in providing answers. Notice how skewed and limited wisdom is when God is not included in the equation.

## Counsel for Better Living (Chapter 7:1-14)

> Two themes dominate vv. 1–12 and unify the section: death (vv. 1b, 2, 4, and perhaps 8) and wisdom and folly (vv. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12).

> These proverbs are  full of irony, and Qohelet often starts off sounding very much like Proverbs but then gives the proverb an ironic twist.  
> Baker, p. 322

**How do I outline these?** It would be too much to go over each one individually. I will probably pick out one or two and examine as examples.

### Verse 1

> Even if parallels to this proverb might be found in the broader wisdom literature, the appearance of it here, in light of Qohelet’s general teaching about death (3:18–21 and 12:1–7), supports an interpretation that this proverb indicates Qohelet’s world-weariness.

## Counsel for Balanced Living (Chapter 7:15-29)

The second half of the chapter offers "counsel for balanced living." 

There are challenging and difficult statements which should be
understood in their context, and in the context of the Bible as a whole. It appears the Preacher is mainly warning against extremism, and against the presumption that one can find the answer to every question in life.

### A. DO THINGS IN MODERATION (15-22)

Reading list on moderation: Proverbs 25:27; Isaiah 5:11; 1 Corinthians 8:9; 1 Corinthians 9:25; Galatians 5:13; Ephesians 5:1; Philippians 4:5. 

#### 1. Why Do the Wicked Prosper?

> 15 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

If we really believe with them that they are getting ahead by sin, we are caught in their deception. 

The prologing of life although may be IN wickedness but it is not because of it.

Also, a life prologed in wickedness is space for repentance and not prologing the "inevitable". In Revelation 2:21, God had given even Jezebel space to repent.

The truth is, The righteous don't ALWAYS prosper carnally, nor do the wicked ALWAYS suffer carnally. 

Find the right balance of living: Avoid extremism in wickedness and foolishness, lest you die before your time.

#### 2. Too Righteous? Too Wise? Too Wicked?

> 16-19

Do not ever refrain from true righteousness and wisdom. Fearing God will help one escape extremism. Wisdom is a source of strength.

Find the right balance of living: Avoid extremism in seeking to be righteous and wise, lest you destroy yourself. 

#### 3. What's that in your eye? 

> 20-22

##### a. Hypocrisy and Self-Righteousness

Scripture on Hypocrisy: Matthew 23:27,28; Luke 6:41,46; Romans 2:1; Galatians 6:3; 1 John 4:20

> Luke 6:41 &mdash; And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

Where are you standing?

> 1 Corinthians 10:12 &mdash; Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

##### b. Don't take to heart everything you hear
 
 You may hear another curse you and yet you have likely cursed someone at sometime. 

##### c. Remember in Humility your own failings.

No man of his own strength is invincible or perfect even the wise.

### B. WISDOM ALONE IS NOT THE ANSWER (v. 23-29)

#### 1. There are questions wisdom can't answer (v. 23-25)

Some things are beyond one's ability to find. No matter how hard and long you search. The preacher testifies, "I've Tried and Failed.""

#### 2. A wicked woman is certainly to be avoided (v.26)

It is not that he has learning nothing in his search, but there are things that are clear as day Which he found out in his search for wisdom.

The wicked woman is more bitter than death and the sinner is at a disadvantage with here.

He who pleases God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her

#### 3. A Good A good man is hard to find

> 27-29

God Made Man Good, but Man is not Good. In his search, the preacher found only one in a thousand. A good woman was even rarer. 

- Goodness, Purity, Uprightness, Virtue
- Why is there a scarcity of "goodness"?
- Is there truly a disparity of "goodness" between man and woman?

God made man upright, but man has sought out many schemes.
