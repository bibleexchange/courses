# The Psalms of Enthronement

## Introduction

The **Psalms of Enthronement** contain the expression “the Lord reigns” (or, in the case of Psalm 98, “the Lord, the King”), and speak of the rule of God over all the earth. They are prophetic of Christ’s kingly rule.

These Psalms are #'s' 47, 93, 96 – 99.

He is "kingly" to the greatest extant. A King reigns, has domimion and a good king is the joy of His people.

## Psalm 47

> ... he is a great king ... our King ... King of all the earth ... God reigneth over the heathen ... God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.

> 1 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 2 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. 3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 9 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

### 1. vs. 1 (We Sing)

### 2.  v. 2 He is **TERRIBLE**

>  Psalm 66:3 &mdash; Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.

Psalm 45:4; Psalm 65:5; Psalm 66:5; Psalm 68:35; Psalm 76:12; Psalm 99:3; Psalm 106:22

- What does it mean that God is terrible?

"to be feared," "reverenced,", "powerful," "tyrannical,", "aweinspiring,", "terror,", "fright", "dreadful," , "fear"

The above terms when describing man's dealings usually suggests cruelty and abuse, but God is "terrible" by reason of his greatness, infinite power, justice, feaful judgments, perfect holiness and faithfulness. (Exodus 34:10; Deuteronomy 7:21; Nehemiah 9:32; Job 6:4; 37:22; Joel 2:11; Zechariah 2:11; Hebrews 12:21)

> Psalms 88:15 &mdash; I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

"The terror of the Lord" speaks of the reverence or fear inspired by the thought that Christ is judge.

> 2 Corinthians 5:10,11 &mdash; For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.

### 3. "Sing Praises" vs. 5,6,7

Praise is a duty. Matthew Henry wrote, "Praise is a duty in which we ought to be frequent and abundant."

In verse 7 is given an important rule in our praise of God, "with understanding". Many rejoice in such beliefs "We are all God's children" and Mr. Henry questioned, "Why do we vainly fancy that we belong to him, unless the Spirit reign in our hearts by faith?"

Praise with understanding is an invitation, "Set up thy kingdom in our hearts."

### 4. "The Throne of His Holiness" v.8 

Upon his holy throne, The idea is, that his government is established in holiness and justice.

> Isaiah 9:6,7 &mdash; For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.

"He sitteth", He remains unmoved on an undisputed throne. (Treasury of David "undisputed throne".) He has TAKEN HIS SEAT upon His throne. He is sovereign over the whole world.

### 5. "the shields of the earth belong unto God" v.9

"shields" or "strong ones", "princes". "King" and "Shield" are synonomous (Psalm 84:9). The "shields" is a reference to the princes of the people or the heads of the tribes that are gathered together.

> Revelation 7:9 &mdash; After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;

## Psalm 93

> ... The LORD reigneth ...

> 1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. 5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.

- A monarch robed in splendor and a warrior king dressed for battle. v.1
- Not only reigns over Israel, but over the WHOLE WORLD.
- The world is seated in his foundation, yet firmer still is the throne of God. As the earth is but His footstool! (Isaiah 66:1) v.2
- His "majesty" (v.1, loftiness) is comparerd to the swelling of the sea (Ps. 89:9). Mightier than the mighty waves is the LORD on high! v.3,4
- His testimonies (his words, covenant, promises, precepts) are described as "very sure". Greater and more firm a foundation for a life are the testimonies and Word of God than even the great power of God witnessed in nature. His law of holiness is truer evidence of the existence of God than the laws of nature.
- a) It becomes the people of God to be Holy in their approach of worship and service the Holy God. b) The very "ornamentation" of the house of God is Holiness. God would no more renounce his faithfulness in keeping His promises than He would renounce the very Holiness that is the ornamentation of His House.

## Psalm 96

> ... the LORD reigneth ...

> 1 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 2 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. 4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 7 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. 11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. 12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.

- "Shew forth His salvation"
- the gods of the nations are idols but the LORD made the heavens! v.5
- Withholding Glory? v. 7,8
- Worship the Lord in the "Beauty of Holiness", v. 9

The Latin Vulgate has in the margin "Bow before Jehovah in holy attire."

> 1 Chronicles 16:29,30 &mdash; Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.

## Psalm 97

> ... The LORD reigneth ... righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne ...

> 1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. 2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. 3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. 7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. 8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. 10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

## Psalm 98

> ... the LORD, the King ...

> 1 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. 2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King. 7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together 9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.

## Psalm 99

> ... The LORD reigneth ... he sitteth between the cherubims ...  

1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved. 2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people. 3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. 4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy. 6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. 8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.

- "He sitteth between the cherubims"
- "at his footstool" Isaiah 66:1
