# The Psalms of Enthronement

## Introduction

The **Psalms of Enthronement** contain the expression “the Lord reigns” (or, in the case of Psalm 98, “the Lord, the King”), and speak of the rule of God over all the earth. They are prophetic of Christ’s kingly rule.

These Psalms are 47, 93, 96 – 99.

He is "kingly" to the greatest extant. A King reigns, has domimion and a good king is the joy of His people.

## Psalm 47

> ... he is a great king ... our King ... King of all the earth ... God reigneth over the heathen ... God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.

### 1. vs. 1 (We Sing)

### 2.  v. 2 He is **TERRIBLE**

>  Psalm 66:3 &mdash; Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.

Psalm 45:4; Psalm 65:5; Psalm 66:5; Psalm 68:35; Psalm 76:12; Psalm 99:3; Psalm 106:22

- What does it mean that God is terrible?

"to be feared," "reverenced,", "powerful," "tyrannical,", "aweinspiring,", "terror,", "fright", "dreadful," , "fear"

The above terms when describing man's dealings usually suggests cruelty and abuse, but God is "terrible" by reason of his greatness, infinite power, justice, feaful judgments, perfect holiness and faithfulness. (Exodus 34:10; Deuteronomy 7:21; Nehemiah 9:32; Job 6:4; 37:22; Joel 2:11; Zechariah 2:11; Hebrews 12:21)

> Psalms 88:15 &mdash; I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

"The terror of the Lord" speaks of the reverence or fear inspired by the thought that Christ is judge.

> 2 Corinthians 5:10,11 &mdash; For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.

### 3. "Sing Praises" vs. 5,6,7

Praise is a duty. Matthew Henry wrote, "Praise is a duty in which we ought to be frequent and abundant."

In verse 7 is given an important rule in our praise of God, "with understanding". Many rejoice in such beliefs "We are all God's children" and Mr. Henry questioned, "Why do we vainly fancy that we belong to him, unless the Spirit reign in our hearts by faith?"

Praise with understanding is an invitation, "Set up thy kingdom in our hearts."

### 4. "The Throne of His Holiness" v.8 

Upon his holy throne, The idea is, that his government is established in holiness and justice.

> Isaiah 9:6,7 &mdash; For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.

"He sitteth", He remains unmoved on an undisputed throne. (Treasury of David "undisputed throne".) He has TAKEN HIS SEAT upon His throne. He is sovereign over the whole world.

### 5. "the shields of the earth belong unto God" v.9

"shields" or "strong ones", "princes". "King" and "Shield" are synonomous (Psalm 84:9). The "shields" is a reference to the princes of the people or the heads of the tribes that are gathered together.

> Revelation 7:9 &mdash; After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;

## Psalm 93

> ... The LORD reigneth ...

- A monarch robed in splendor and a warrior king dressed for battle. v.1
- Not only reigns over Israel, but over the WHOLE WORLD.
- The world is seated in his foundation, yet firmer still is the throne of God. As the earth is but His footstool! (Isaiah 66:1) v.2
- His "majesty" (v.1, loftiness) is comparerd to the swelling of the sea (Ps. 89:9). Mightier than the mighty waves is the LORD on high! v.3,4
- His testimonies (his words, covenant, promises, precepts) are described as "very sure". Greater and more firm a foundation for a life are the testimonies and Word of God than even the great power of God witnessed in nature. His law of holiness is truer evidence of the existence of God than the laws of nature.
- a) It becomes the people of God to be Holy in their approach of worship and service the Holy God. b) The very "ornamentation" of the house of God is Holiness. God would no more renounce his faithfulness in keeping His promises than He would renounce the very Holiness that is the ornamentation of His House.

## Psalm 96

> ... the LORD reigneth ...

- "Shew forth His salvation"
- the gods of the nations are idols but the LORD made the heavens! v.5
- Withholding Glory? v. 7,8
- Worship the Lord in the "Beauty of Holiness", v. 9

The Latin Vulgate has in the margin "Bow before Jehovah in holy attire."

> 1 Chronicles 16:29,30 &mdash; Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
