# Death, Life, and Evil Times

## The Despair of Death: One Event Unto All (vs. 1-3)

- Men Don't know the Love of God by what is seen, v. 1
- the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are **in the hand of God** (Is this disappointing to you?)
- Without any sense of eternity or accountability in a life to come, man can know neither love nor hatred by anything they see before them. Creation can tell us God is; it doesn't tell us very well that God loves us.

> "We have only to use our eyes without prejudice, according to Psalm 19 and Romans 1:19 ff., to see that there is a powerful and glorious Creator. But it takes more than observation to discover how He is disposed towards us." (Kidner)

- Should we measure God's love by what happens in life? We measure God's love by what Jesus did at the cross.
- vs. 3 "This is an evil"
- they go to the dead

> "To all appearances, God is just not interested. The things that are supposed to matter most to Him turn out to make no difference - or none that anyone can see - to the way we are disposed of in the end. Moral or immoral, religious or profane, we are all mown down alike." (Kidner)

## The Hope of Life: No Hope in the Grave (vs. 4-10)

- In Light of Death, How Can We Live?
- If all existence and consciousness ends with death, then the only thing that matters is this present life (and therefore nothing really matters).
- v.7 SMALL HOPE? "Go, eat your bread with joy". "Life is utterly meaningless and our common death and destiny prove it to be so. So forget about all I have said and have a good time."
- Fatalism and wishing: Perhaps the sense is, "God has already accepted your works - I hope; because if He hasn't, there is nothing you can do about it."
- Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity: Clearly, Qoholet knew that enjoying the good things at hand in this life - bread, wine, garments, comforts (let your head lack no oil), and a wife whom you love - none of these took away the meaninglessness of life. "Make your vain life a little better,".

> "White garments and anointing oil make life more comfortable in a hot climate." (Eaton)

> 10

- The Preacher continued to give advice meant to make the best of the bad situation of life under the sun. (Ecc 9:7-10) With such a view of life and death, joy is only found in the moment.

> "Man was not created to be idle, he was not elected to be idle, he was not redeemed to be idle, he was not quickened to be idle, and he is not sanctified by God's grace to be idle." (Spurgeon)

## The Mystery of Time and Chance: Happens to All (vs. 11-18)

- Time and chance make life under the sun hard to understand.
- In a world that made more sense under the sun, then the swift would always win the race and the strong would always win the battle. Yet it doesn't always work that way.
- In his somewhat contradictory way, the one who previously proclaimed God's management of all (Ecclesiastes 7:13 and 9:1) now wondered if it didn't all happen according to "time and chance".
- v.11 The Mystery of Time and Chance: Race NOT to the SWIFT | Battle NOT to the STRONG | Bread NOT to the WISE | Riches NOT to the MEN OF UNDERSTANDING | Favor NOT to MEN OF SKILL

### Taken in an Evil Time, v. 12

v. 12 Men are like fishes taken in a net and birds caught in a snare: TAKEN IN AN EVIL TIME

No amount of wisdom or skill appears to prevent such a snare.

- "evil time"
	- Judges 9:23 "Then God sent an evil spirit..."
	- Psalm 91 Under the Shadow of the Almighty is Protection from "the reward of the wicked" 
	- Ecclesiastes 12:1 Remember NOW before the evil days come
	- Matthew 4:1 Jesus was led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil
	- Matthew 13:38-43 "the tares are the children of the wicked one;"
	- Matthew 24:6-8 beginning of sorrows
	- 2 Timothy 3:1-4 "perilous times shall come"
	- Galatians 6:7-9 Be patient for "in due season"
	- Ephesians 5:15-16 walk circumspectly ... 16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
	- Ephesians 6:13 "that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day"
	- 2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise

- Some examples of "TAKEN IN AN EVIL TIME":

1. John 9:2,3 Joh 9:2 "who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?" , "Neither..."
2. Matthew 2:16 Herod slew all the children that were in Bethlehem (male, under 2 years)
3. 

- We should not interpret this as "for NO reason" merely because we cannot SEE the reason. The Sovereign God does not rule chaotically. ("No reason" suggests God either wasn't paying attention or doesn't care.)

Bad things happen as a result of humanity’s choices; as a result of sin and forsaking God. But none of them happen “accidentally” or apart from God’s will.

> Genesis 45:5-8

### Wisdom is Better, but Is Often Wasted, vs. 13-18

In Light of Death, wisdom is pre-eminant and often unappreciated.

#### 1. (Ecc 9:13-15) Wisdom unrecognized.

A poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city.

Yet no one remembered that same poor man: Under the premise that death ends existence and consciousness for all, Qoholet protested that the only lasting meaning this man might have - to be remembered - was taken away. The almost unbelievable fleetingness of fame added to the sense of meaninglessness of life.

Men quickly forget, but God never does. He knows those who are His (2 Timothy 2:19). He has a book of remembrance before Him for those that fear the Lord (Malachi 3:16), and their names are written in heaven (Luke 10:20).

#### 2. (Ecc 9:16-18) Wisdom thwarted.

a. Wisdom is better than strength: The Preacher knew that even though wisdom is not appreciated and it is ultimately vain, it was still better than strength.

b. Words of the wise, spoken quietly, should be heard rather than the shout of a ruler of fools: Because wisdom is superior, it should be heard above the shouts of the foolish - even though wisdom will often be unappreciated.

i. "The Preacher continues to emphasize the ease with which wisdom is counteracted." (Eaton)

c. Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good: Wisdom is better - better than strength (weapons of war), better than foolishness - but all the good that wisdom does can quickly be taken away by one sinner who destroys much good.

i. Qoholet sensed that it was much easier to destroy than to build. Establishing things by wisdom is much more difficult than destroying them by the work of even one sinner.

- Adam's sin infected the whole race of man. (Romans 5:12)
- Achan's transgression caused Israel's defeat. (Joshua 7:11, 12)
- Rehoboam's folly resulted in the great division of Israel and Judah. (1 Kings 12:16)
