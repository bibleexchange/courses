# What Proverbs says about the power of words

## Death and life are in the power of the tongue

> Proverbs 18:21—Death and life are in the power of the tongue:  
> And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

Some preachers will tell you that this scripture reveals that there is a supernatural force behind our words, and that with our words we can speak things into existence. They say that if you claim good things and say, "I will have a new car," then God will give you a new car. They also say that if you let negative words escape your mouth, such as, "I am feeling sick today," then you will experience the things you said.

Can our words change the world in which we live? The answer is both "yes" and "no." This verse is not saying that our words have magical or supernatural power. There are other passages in the Bible that mention spiritual forces working behind the words of humans, but this is talking about a very human and natural way that our words can affect our lives. It is this: our words have consequences.

The primary way that one human lets another human know what he is thinking is through words. They may be spoken, recorded with an electronic device, or written down, but they are still words. You cannot read another person's mind, and body language is not consistent in its interpretation. This means that whatever is in our head (good or bad), is only known if we open our mouths. If we say things that are helpful or encouraging to someone, then we could expect them to feel happy and want to be our friend. If we say things to hurt people or to say things that will make them feel sad or angry, then we should expect them to react negatively to what we said. They may return hurtful words to us, start crying, or throw a punch. If they are our boss, then we may get reprimanded or fired. In Matthew 12:36–37 Jesus says that our words can also affect us in the life to come. He said that on the judgment day we will have to "give account" of all of our words, and depending on what they were, we will either be condemned or justified.

The tongue is a powerful tool (or weapon, depending on how it is used). James says it is like the helm of a ship, because even though it is small, the tongue can alter the course of our lives (James 3:3–5). The book of Proverbs gives many examples of the consequences to the things we say.

<!-- The tongue stands in the middle ready for either use; you are its master. So also does a sword lie in the middle; if you use it against the enemy, it becomes an instrument for your safety; if you use it to wound yourself, it is not the steel but your own transgression of the law that causes your death. Let us think of the tongue in the same way, as a sword lying in the middle. Sharpen it to accuse yourself of your own sins, but do not use it to wound your brother.
> Hence, God has surrounded the tongue with a double wall—with the barrier of the teeth and the fence of the lips—in order that it may not easily and heedlessly utter words it should not speak. BAPTISMAL INSTRUCTIONS 9.33–35.

## Some positive consequences of words

### We can benefit from our own good words

Proverbs 18:20, which immediately precedes the verse about life and death being in the power of the tongue, talks about the positive results that come from speaking wisely:

> Proverbs 18:20—A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;  
> And with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

Our words are like seeds, and if they are healthy seeds, then they will produce fruit. In his commentary on Proverbs, Lindsay Wilson says that "the idea of the first line is that those who speak well (e.g. carefully, truthfully, compellingly) can gain success and earn a living (e.g. by making a deal, motivating others, resolving problems). Their lips or speech produce a useful outcome which enables them to meet their needs." [1] Tremper Longman III takes a slightly different approach and says that "just as food satisfies one’s physical hunger, so also words satisfy one’s intellectual and spiritual hunger."[2] Both interpretations fit because they show the positive results of our words. See also 12:14 and 13:2.

<!-- Moffatt paraphrases 20 well, but one-sidedly: ‘A man must answer for his utterances, and take the consequences of his words.’
> Kidner, D. (1964). Proverbs: An Introduction and Commentary (Vol. 17, p. 123). Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press.-->

There are times when we find ourselves in difficult situations, but if we use wise words, they will deliver us out of the trouble (12:6).

### Other people can benefit from our good words

Our words do not only affect us, but they can help our hinder those who hear us. If we speak wisely, then we can help other people. Everyone faces discouragement at some time, and our words can add to that discouragement or they can encourage the person. A person may have "heaviness" in their heart, but a good word can lift their spirits and make the heart glad (12:25). Wisdom can help you say the right word at the right time to help someone (15:23; 25:11–12). Proverbs uses many different illustrations that show how our words can be beneficial to others:

* The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life (10:11)
* The tongue of the just is as choice silver (10:20)
* The lips of knowledge are a precious jewel (20:15)
* The lips of the righteous feed many (10:21)
* The tongue of the wise is health (12:18)
* Pleasant words are as an honeycomb (16:24)
* A wholesome tongue is a tree of life (15:4)

We need to ask ourselves if our words are matching up with the examples on this list. Are the things that I say random and useless or are they as valuable as silver? When I speak are people fed? Are my words sweet like a honeycomb or are they bitter?

## Some negative consequences of words

### Our words can hurt ourselves

Many times we blame others for our troubles, but it is very possible that our problems are a consequence of foolish or unrighteous words (6:12–15; 12:13; **18:7**). These words can trap us as people use the things that we have said against us. This snare is not always because of wicked words. For example, how many of us have felt trapped because we made an unwise promise that we couldn't keep? If we do not carefully guard our mouth, it will put us in positions where people will want to verbally and perhaps even physically fight with us (10:14; 17:20; **18:6**).

      3       In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride:
      But the lips of the wise shall preserve them.

### Our words can hurt others

Just as good words can help other people, bad words can hurt them. The saying "sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me" is not true. Proverbs says that our words can be like "the piercings of a sword" (12:18), and with it we can destroy our neighbor (11:9) or even a whole city (11:11). It may seem like an exaggeration that mere words could destroy a city, but looking at history would remind us of how many tyrants were able to destroy not only cities, but whole countries through their speeches and propaganda. 

Proverbs 16:27 says that in there is a burning fire in the lips of the ungodly man. James adds that the flame of the tongue sets "on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell" (James 3:6). Like fire, gossip and lies spread very quickly.

## Some advice on using words profitably

### Don't be quick to answer

We need to think before we talk. Knee-jerk reactions are hardly ever profitable (15:28). There is a saying that says, "God gave you two ears and only one mouth, so you should do twice as much listening as you do talking." That is not scripture, but it is a scriptural principle that we need to listen. We should not give our opinion about something before we have a good understanding of it (18:13). We also need to be careful that we are not listening to foolish people, liars, or talebearers (14:7; 17:4; 20:19).

Proverbs 18:13 says that we need to be careful to listen to someone tell us about a problem before we answer. In court, the judge listens to both sides of a problem before he makes a decision. See also 16:20, 21:23, and 29:20.

### Talking too much is not good

Being a man of few words is a sign of wisdom (17:27), and even a fool can seem like a wise man if he doesn't speak much (17:28)! The reason that the wise man doesn't speak much is because he is trying to avoid sinning with his words. The person who talks a lot is guaranteed to say something foolish or sinful because they don't take the time to think before they speak (10:19; 10:8; 10:10; 13:3).

### Against slander and gossip

Proverbs teaches us that gossip can hurt people (18:8; 26:22). The Jewish Midrash says “The evil tongue slays three, the slanderer, the slandered, and the listener” (Midrash Tehillim 52:2). A little whispering can separate even the closest of friendships (16:28). It should be our desire to unite people, and not to divide them. Our words often put negative thoughts in the heads of others.

#### Sometimes it is best not to talk about someone's sin

If we know about someone's sin we should not tell everyone about it (17:9; 10:12). Many times we use prayer requests as an opportunity to share about other peoples mistakes and sins. When you choose not to talk about what someone has done, then, by default, you have chosen to cover it. We should not lie to protect someone, and if there is someone else that is in danger because of the person's sin, then we should speak up about it. See also 10:18, and 11:12, and 25:23.

### Flattery is deceiving

When people aren't around, we will often say bad things about them, but when we see them, we only tell them good things about themselves. Our modern culture strongly values affirmation. It says "everyone is a winner," "You are beautiful just the way you are," and "you are a strong and powerful person." We care about "likes" on social media. Encouragement is a good thing, but we need to be careful that we are giving encouragement that is true and helpful. If we tell someone that they are a good cook, but then don't like to eat their food, then we are lying. We say that we don't want to hurt their feelings, but they will not grow without constructive criticism. We need to speak the truth gently and in love (Ephesians 4:15). They may feel hurt at the moment, but later they might appreciate it (28:23).

Proverbs warns that a flattering mouth ruins things (**26:28**). When we flatter someone, we set them up for a fall (29:5). We think we are being nice, but really we are hurting them. Jesus warned us that it is not good when everyone speaks well of us, because many people have spoken good things about false prophets (Luke 6:26). We should be more concerned with our lives aligning with the Bible then with pleasing people so that they will like us.

### Honesty is the best policy

It may seem like an obvious thing that we should always tell the truth, but Proverbs repeats the idea many times so that we will remember (**12:19**; 12:22; 14:5; 14:25; 19:5; 19:9; **21:6**; 24:28–29; 25:18). Truth is loved by both God (12:22) and man (24:26).

### It is not only what we say, but how we say it that matters

You can say the right words, but if you can say them in a mean or angry manner, then you may still get negative results. If you approach someone loud and angrily, then it is likely that they will also raise their voices and be angry, but if we approach them quietly and meekly, they are more likely to remain calm (15:1). Soft words are also powerful because they  can break down hard-set opposition (25:15). See also 16:21.

### Don't argue with fools

Proverbs 23:9 tells us that we should not try speaking to a foolish person, because they will despise what you say. Paul told both Titus (Titus 3:9) and Timothy (II Timothy 2:23) to avoid pointless conversations because they will only produce strife. Even with these warnings, sometimes it is wise to try to persuade a foolish person (26:4–5).

<!--
### The wise man spreads knowledge?

?? Proverbs 12:23 (KJV 1900)
      23       A prudent man concealeth knowledge:
      But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.

Proverbs 15:7 (KJV 1900)
      7       The lips of the wise disperse knowledge:
      But the heart of the foolish doeth not so.

### The tongue of the wise uses knowledge correctly

Proverbs 15:2 (KJV 1900)
      2       The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright:
      But the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.
-->

### We should speak righteous words

> Proverbs 15:26—The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD:  
> But the words of the pure are pleasant words.

> Proverbs 16:13—Righteous lips are the delight of kings;  
> And they love him that speaketh right.

See also 19:1.

## Conclusion

Talking is one of the easiest things to do, but it is also the easiest way to sin or hurt people. That is why Proverbs gives many warnings and much advice on how we should speak.

>Proverbs 16:1—The preparations of the heart in man,  
> And the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.

See also 16:10.

<!--I'm not sure where to fit these in right now. They could be worked in later.
> To give advice in the king’s presence in well-chosen words was a very responsible office which demanded precise, expert knowledge which one could acquire only after a long training. It is, therefore, no accident if, in all these didactic works, instructions about the right and wrong use of words plays such a large role.
