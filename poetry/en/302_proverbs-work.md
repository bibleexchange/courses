## Lessons from the ant

### He has no leader

No one has to tell him what to do. He knows that winter is coming, and so he must gather food.

The hard-worker does not need a leader, and in fact, he will likely become a leader (12:24). This hard work can keep you from becoming the slave of another. Jesus gave several stories of people who were given more authority because of their hard work.

### He works for future needs

10:5

We need to plan ahead for difficult times.

Saving.

Budgeting.

Joseph saved Egypt and his family by storing the food for the famine ahead. In contrast, the prodigal son spent everyting he had, and was in trouble when famine came.

### Laziness leads to poverty (6:10&ndash;11)

Working hard brings wealth (10:4; 12:11; 12:27)

You don't work, you don't eat.

> It is not riches the lazy person lacks; it is food, the necessity of life (cf. 19:15; 20:13; 23:21).  
> Waltke, B. K. (2004). The Book of Proverbs, Chapters 1â€“15 (p. 339). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Being lazy can ruin your reputation. People will not want to work with you. (10:26)

## Dreaming big does not help unless you work

13:4; 21:25&ndash;26

But planning is still needed (21:5).

****************************************************

A lot of this is already covered in the chapter on money.

I could move what hasn't been covered to the notes about character and create a section on work ethic.
