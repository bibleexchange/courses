# Chapter 2: Voice of the Lord Trying the Hearts of His People

## The Voice of the Lord, vs. 1-3, 6

> Job 2:1-3,6&mdash;1 ¶ Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. 2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. Job 6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.

### It is truly the voice of the Lord that tried Job.

> Job 2:3&mdash;&hellip; And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, &hellip;

> 1Th 2:4 … we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.

### This is the Voice of the One Who Will Keep Job!

> Jude 24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,

### Job's Trial is an Offensive against Encroaching Evil

> Job 2:2&mdash;And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 

> Psalm 94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 

> 1 Peter 5:8-10 &mdash;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.

## The Voice of the Accuser, vs. 2:4-5

> Job 2:4,5&mdash;4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. 5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.

### His Accusations Come Without Cause

This is NOT what he said in chapter 1 -- 

> Job 1:11&mdash;But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.

The accuser will try anything to see if it sticks!

> Job 2:3 …although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. 

> Job 9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.


- David
 
>Ps 69:4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head:…

> 1Sa 19:5 … wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

- Jesus

> John 15:25 … They hated me without a cause.

## The Voice of the Foolish, vs. 7-9            (hurt ,pain ,anguish)

> Job 2:7-10&mdash; 7 ¶ So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. 8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. 9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. 

It is foolish to doubt, discourage, disobey, quit, complain, be angry, be sorrowful, or curse God, and sin with your lips.

## The Voice of Those Who Mean Well, vs. 11-13

Job 2:11 ¶ Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. 12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.

- Silent when prayer was needed the most.
- They Sit first in judgment.

## The Voice of the Sufferer, v.10

> Job 2:10&mdash;But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.

### In The Trial, Let Us Look Toward and not Against Heaven

One voice in all of this we haven't brought attention to is the voice of the one suffering.

We don't hear his full response to start until chapter 3 and later, but it is remarkable what we do not hear from in Chapter 2.

Because of his reverence and Godly fear, Job is careful to no sin with his lips. (1:5 Job did this continually) Job was mindful of what God would judge. (Often our salvation will run right out of our mouth!)
 
Sometimes the greatest understanding comes out of the deepest sufferings

### Out of Christs Wounds Come Our Healing!

> Isa. 53:5&mdash;But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
<!-- -->
> I Pt. 2:24&mdash;Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
<!-- -->
> Heb. 4:15&mdash;For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
<!-- -->
> II Cor. 5:21&mdash;For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
<!-- -->
> Gal. 3:13&mdash;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:

### Jesus Warned There was a Betrayer Among Them, But not All Were!

> Luke. 22:28 &mdash;Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
<!-- -->
> II Tim.2:12&mdash;If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:
<!-- -->
> Rom. 8:17&mdash;And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
