# What the book of Proverbs says about money

Money is a very important subject. It may not seem like a spiritual subject, but it can affect our lives in spiritually negative ways if we do not manage it correctly. Paul told Timothy that an unhealthy love for money is a source of evil (1 Timothy 6:10). Many marriage problems are because of money. Modern advice says not to do business with friends or family because it can cause fighting. These problems are not new, and there is some great advice in the book of Proverbs that can help shape our attitudes about wealth and how we spend it.

The Proverbs talk about money and other kinds of wealth, such as fields, plentiful harvests, and other possessions. This is natural for an agrarian culture where some people traded goods for other goods.

## Where does money come from?

By reading Proverbs, we can compile a list of what brings prosperity to people:

* Wisdom (Proverbs 8:18, 21)
* Hard work (Proverbs 14:4)
* God (Proverbs 10:22)
* Righteousness (Proverbs 13:21&ndash;22, 25; 15:6)
* Obedience (Proverbs 13:18)

Reading the above verses, you might draw the conclusion that the only people that are rich are those that love God, are wise, and work hard. But then why are many rich people wicked (Proverbs 28:6), foolish (Proverbs 30:22), and lazy? 

### God gives some blessings to all men

Both rich and poor are created by God (22:2). All people are His creation, and so He loves them all and cares for them all. He even cares for the wicked. Jesus gave an example of this by saying that God sends rain to both the just and the unjust (Matthew 5:45). Someone may be blessed physically, but that does not mean that God is pleased with what they are doing.

### The benefits of hard work is a universal principle

We have to remember that Proverbs are not absolute promises, but principles. It's not an automatic guarantee that if you get up early every day and work hard that you will be rich, but the chances of you getting rich while lying in bed are very slim. God gives blessings to the righteous, but anyone, including a sinner, can benefit from the advice to work hard. Following are some basic principles about work that apply to everyone:

* If you do not plant seeds, then you will not have a harvest (12:11; 28:19).
* Some people only talk about what they want to do, but talk or ideas alone wont make you rich. You have to put actions to those words (14:23).
* If you stay in bed all day, your fields won't be plowed. Neither will anyone pay you to sleep. If you want to get paid, you have to get out of bed (20:13).
* You can start working hard on a project, but unless you continue working on it, it will not produce results (24:30&ndash;34).

### Not all blessings are physical

If you are righteous, God will bless you, but it will not always be with money or physical possessions. As humans, we often think that money is the most important thing for life, but God knows that there are other blessings that we need more than money.

In chapter 3, we see a description of Woman Wisdom. Verse 16 says that she holds life in her right hand and riches and honor in her left hand. In ancient Hebrew culture, the right hand was more honored than the left hand was honored (Gen. 48:14; Ecc. 10:12; Matt. 25:33) [1]. This shows us that wisdom may give riches, but riches are not as important as life is. Also, the two verses which immediately precede it (3:15&ndash;15) talk about how wisdom is better than gold and silver (See also 8:19 and 16:16). Wealth is not bad, but wisdom is better. God gave Solomon wealth, but only because he first asked for wisdom. Wisdom is not the only thing that is better than wealth. Proverbs gives many things that are better than having money:

* The lips of knowledge (20:15)
* A good name (22:1)
* Being an honest person (19:22)
* A good wife is better (31:10)
* Walking in integrity (19:1)
* Fear of God (15:16-17; 16:8; 16:19)

> Wealth is a desirable state and the reward of wisdom (see 3:9–10), not the aim of one’s life.

## Money does not solve all problems

Why does God say that so many things are more valuable than money? It is because there are many things that money cannot buy. Money gives you a sense of security (10:15), but money will fail you (Proverbs 11:28). Money cannot save a failing marriage. Money cannot save you from a cure-less disease. And money cannot help you in the afterlife (11:4; 11:28).

### Money cannot buy true friends

When you have money, many people will want to be your friend (14:20; 19:4; 19:7), but are these people true friends? Will these same people want to be your friend when the money is gone?

### Money does not last forever

Proverbs 23:4&ndash;5 says that wealth grows wings and flies away (See also 27:23&ndash;24). 

### Money can bring problems to your life

Proverbs 17:1 suggests that wealth can be the cause of strife in a home. It can also make you proud (Proverbs 28:11) and demanding (Proverbs 18:23).

## God gives riches so that we might share with others

We are commanded to give back to God (Proverbs 3:9-10), but we are also commanded to help the poor. God will provide for the poor (10:3; 15:25; **22:22-23**), and He may use us to do it. If we have something, and we have a neighbor that needs it, we should give it to them (Proverbs 3:27-28). Jesus repeated this command during the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:42). God gives wealth to certain people so that they would redistribute it to others. Those people who are virtuous will share what they have with the poor (Proverbs 29:7; 31:20). Part of the reason that there is poverty in the world is because of social and economic injustice (13:23). 

Those that give to the poor will be blessed (11:24; 14:21; **19:17**; 22:9; 28:27).

### God will not listen to those who do not help the poor

All men are created in the image of God, and when we oppress any person, we insult God (14:31; 17:5). In Matthew 25, Jesus tells the story about people who will be punished because they neglected the poor. He said that when people neglect the poor, they are really neglecting Him (Matthew 25:41&ndash;46). See also Proverbs 21:13, 28:27, and 29:14.

Those that take advantage of the poor will be punished (22:16; 23:10-11).

## Some advice about using money

### Save for the difficult times

We need to make plans about how we will spend our finances (Proverbs 21:5). The ant is used as an example of saving for difficult times (Proverbs 6:6&ndash;11).

### Borrowing from others makes you a slave to them

Proverbs 22:7; 6:1-5

<!--?? 22:26-27-->

### Whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man

21:17; 21:20; 29:3; 23:20-21

### Getting rich quickly is usually not good

Working in something consistent that will bring a moderate reward is better than looking for new ways to not have to work hard (12:11) (The 4-Hour Work Week). Many times work is difficult, but trying to find an easier way may not be profitable (14:4). See also Proverbs 13:11, 20:21, 21:5, and 28:20-22.

### Getting rich through dishonest means will fail in the end

Some people make money by dishonest means, but there will be consequences (10:2; 11:18: **13:11**; 15:27; 21:6). Proverbs gives warnings about using false weights when selling merchandise (20:10; 20:23) and stealing ground by moving boundary markers (22:28; 23:10-11).

## Conclusion

Two things I ask:

1. Do not let me be poor
2. Do not let me be rich

Proverbs 30:7-9

<!--

18:11 says that it's strength is in partially in his own mind. (Interestingly, the verse before this talks about the name of the Lord being a strong tower)
