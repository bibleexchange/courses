# Psalms of Confidence

**Psalms of confidence** include a lament, but the ideas of security, peace, joy, and confidence predominate. 

(psalms 3, 4, 11, 16, 23, 27, 62, 115, 121, 125, 129, 131)

Our study of the psalms of confidence appropriately follows our study of the psalms of lament which are dominated by disappointment and questions addressed to God. The Psalms of Confidence are characterised by their attitude of faith, trust and sense of security in God.

## National Confidence

(psalms 115, 125, 129)

### Psalm 115

- "Not Unto Us" ... 
	
	Taking credit for God's work? "there's a danger of idolatry when we make God's work about us instead of Him."

- Useless Idols -- "the work of men's hands"

	Idolatry in the modern church: 1) Celebrity Ministries 2) Worshipping Worship 3) Still Silver and Gold  4) Objectifyinig God (vs. Personal Experience) 5) Viewing God's Word through an Unfaithful Prism

> Exodus 20:3 &mdash; Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

- Psalm 100:3

> Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
 
- vs. 12 "The Lord hath been mindful of us: he will bless us;"

### Psalm 125

- the title: "A Song of Degrees"

This psalm is a part of a "Pilgrim's Song Book" or "Songs of Degrees or Ascents". This a title given to fifteen of the Psalms, 120–134, each starting with the ascription Shir Hama'aloth. They are also variously called Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps or Pilgrim Songs. Four of them (122, 124, 131 and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one (127) to Solomon. Psalms of Ascents were sung by pilgrims journeying up to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.


### Psalm 129

The Heathen vs. the Righteous. Essential to the Psalms of Confidence is the belief that God has a people and that he acts as Protector of this convenant People. (Psalm 23; Exodus 14 "the Exodus")

### "Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus", Dudley Tyng & George Duffield, Jr.

George Duffield, Jr. (1818-1888) wrote his hymn, Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus" out of a tragic accident that resulted in the early death of one of the most stirring preachers in the northeastern United States during the mid-nineteeth-century. 

Dudley Tyng (1825-1858), was one of several ministers participating in a great citywide revival that swept Philadelphia in 1858. His strong doctrinal preaching and his anti-slavery messages were popular for some and angered others, resulting in his resignation from the Episcopal church. In addition to serving the newly organized Church of the Covenant, his midday services at the YMCA attracted crowds as large as 5,000. On one occasion, March 30, 1858, 1000 men responded to the message by committing their lives to Christ.

During this sermon, Tyng is said to have declared, "I would rather that this right arm were amputated at the trunk than that I should come short of my duty to you in delivering God's message." Prophetically and tragically, within a few weeks while visiting the countryside, his arm was caught in the cogs of a corn thrasher and severely lacerated resulting in a great loss of blood and an infection that took his life a few days later. Either in his final sermon or on his deathbed, Tyng is to have said, "Let us stand up for Jesus." Another account states that the dying Tyng told his father, a retired Episcopal minister, "Stand up for Jesus, father, and tell my brethren of the ministry to stand up for Jesus."

Duffield was inspired by the funeral service for Tyng to preach on Ephesians 6:14 in his sermon the following Sunday, the text of which reads, "Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness." (KJV) The hymn he wrote was sung at the conclusion of the sermon.

An omitted stanza five alludes to Tyng's death in lines 5 and 6:

Stand up!—stand up for Jesus!
Each soldier to his post;
Close up the broken column,
And shout through all the host!
Make good the loss so heavy,
In those that still remain,
And prove to all around you
That death itself is gain!

## Individual Confidence

(psalms 3, 4, 11, 16, 23, 27, 62, 121, 131)

### Psalm 3

- The Darkest Days of David’s Life (2 Samuel 15:1 &mdash; 19:8)

David had to flee Jerusalem to escape Absolom's conspiracy against him.

> 2 Samuel 15:13 &mdash; And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. 

- "No Help for him in God"

> 2 Samuel 15:24-29 &mdash; And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. 25 And the king said unto Zadok, **Carry back the ark of God into the city**: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, **he will bring me again**, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 26 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. 27 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, **Art not thou a seer?** return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 28 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. 29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
