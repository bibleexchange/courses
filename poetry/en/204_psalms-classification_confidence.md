# Psalms of Confidence

**Psalms of confidence** include a lament, but the ideas of security, peace, joy, and confidence predominate. 

Many of the psalms express trust in God, but in a few of them trust is the main theme. These are called the _psalms of confidence_. They are 3, 4, 11, 16, 23, 27, 62, 115, 121, 125, 129, and 131.

> Individual lament Psalms are 4, 16, 23, 27, 62, and 73, while the community psalms of trust  include Psalms 90, 115, 123, 124, 125, and 126.

Our study of the psalms of confidence appropriately follows our study of the psalms of lament which are dominated by disappointment and questions addressed to God. The Psalms of Confidence are characterised by their attitude of faith, trust and sense of security in God.

> However, whilst having points of contact with each of these [lament and thanksgiving], the psalms of confidence are distinct from both. The psalmist neither requests God to deliver him from enemies or other evils, nor thanks him for having done so, but rather expresses confidence that God does so. There is a tendency for these psalms to have statements about God in the third person rather than direct address to him in the second person, though this is not entirely lacking.

>  In  addition to the language of faith, the psalmists use many metaphors  and expressions to represent their sense of trusting, like lying down  to rest (23:2) and to sleep (4:8), and enjoying safety in the presence  of one’s enemies (23:5). Metaphors depicting the Lord as light (27:1),  as rock (62:2, 6), and fortress or refuge (16:1; 27:1; 62:8), and the  metaphor of walking in a straight path (27:11), are taken from the  landscape of the psalmist’s world.

> The essential elements in these psalms are the declaration of trust,  which may open the psalm or close it, or may punctuate the poem at  various points, and the interior lament, which may be only a memory  of the trouble that shaped and directed the psalmist’s sense of trust  in God. Neither element has a fixed place in the order of the psalm.

> A third element of this group of psalms is the basis for trust. That  is, sometimes the psalmist recounted a point of knowledge, a spiritual principle he had observed, or an experience that had taught him  the lesson of faith.
> Encountering, p. 426

> The sixth element, and next to the declaration of trust, the most fre-  quent component of the psalms of trust, is the interior lament. It is  not a lament as such, but the remnant of one. In virtually all of these  psalms, as mentioned above, the language suggests some crisis that  the psalmist has endured that taught him to trust in the Lord. It was  an experience that shaped the faith of the psalmist, and out of it grew  a faith that could help him stand against the adversities of life.

They primarily do not make requests for God to be something or do something, but they make declarative statements about who God already is and what He already does.[1] In Psalm 23 David does not ask, "Lord, be a shepherd to me!" be he says, "the Lord **is** my shepherd."

They may contain an invitation for others to trust in God:

* "Put your trust in the LORD" (4:5)
* "Wait on the LORD: Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart" (27:14)
* "Trust in him at all times; ye people" (62:8)
* "O Israel, trust thou in the LORD" (115:9)

Themes:

* Sleep (4:8; 23:2)
* Stability (16:8)
* Protection (27:5-6)
