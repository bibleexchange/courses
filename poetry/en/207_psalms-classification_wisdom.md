# Psalms of Wisdom

## Introduction

Included in the Psalms of Wisdom are psalms: 1, 14, 37, 49, 52, 53, 73, 75, 91, 112, 119, 127, 128, 133, 139.

> While there is general agreement that wisdom psalms exist, and there is a core that occurs in everyone’s list (e.g. Psalms 1; 37; 49), no two scholars seem to agree about the precise number of psalms to be included in this category. For example, according to S. Mowinckel, the wisdom psalms are Psalms 1; 34; 37; 49; 78; 105; 106; 111; 112; 127; according to R.E. Murphy they are Psalms 1; 32; 34; 37; 49; 112; 128; while R.N. Whybray includes Psalms 1; 19B; 37; 49; 51; 73; 90; 92; 94; 104; 107; 111; 119; and L. Perdue Psalms 1; 19A; 19B; 32; 34; 37; 49; 73; 112; 119 and 127.

> Wisdom literature divides naturally into the more ‘orthodox’ type, comparable to the book of Proverbs, and the more questioning approach found in the books of Job and Ecclesiastes. The former type is confident of the just working of God’s appointment of earthly rewards and punishments for the righteous and wicked, while the latter reflects varying degrees of questioning of this schematization of reality. Psalms 1 and 112 may be seen as wisdom psalms reflecting the former position and Psalms 37 and 49 (and possibly 73) the latter, though the Psalter contains nothing as sceptical as Ecclesiastes.

**Torah psalms**

> A sub-category of the wisdom psalms is that of what are sometimes called Torah (Law) psalms, viz. Psalms 119, 19B, and 1, the last of which has already been touched on. Like the term wisdom psalm, the expression Torah psalm is also a statement of content rather than form, but it is a useful category under which to include these psalms.

**Psalms of Wisdom** emphasize:

1. The teaching of the wise men of Israel
2. meditation of the law
3. the way of the righteous versus the way of the wicked
4. The necessity of practical righteousness 

These psalms are similar to Job, Proverbs,  and Ecclesiastes in terms of (1) literary structures, (2) vocabulary, and (3) concepts. They frequently deal with topics such as the injustices of life and the justice of God, the responsibilities of choosing the correct path or manner of living, the relative value of riches, and the fact that man is only a pilgrim or traveler passing through this life.

(1) Literary Structure

Lament, acrostic structures, numerical sayings, and parrellism are all literary stuctures used in the psalms of wisdom and the other Biblical books of poetry. Parrellelism is one example of literary structure the psalms of wisdom share with the other Biblical books of poetry. Parallelism is a major characteristic of Hebrew poetry that can be understood as a balanced repetition:

> Psalm 37:2 &mdash; For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, <br> and wither as the green herb.
<!-- --- -->
> Psalm 139:23 &mdash; Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:

(2) Vocabulary

Common vocabulary expressing lament, thanksgiving, and praise. As well as words related to wisdom, justice, truth, mercy and creation theology.

Shared truth concerning creation includes:

1) God comes first. 2) God speaks. 3) God made everything. 4) There is one God who is good, and he made everything good. 5)  human beings are accountable to God and should praise Him as we are made by Him and for Him. 6) Hints of God’s complexity 7) human begins are introduced as made in the image of God. 8) there is stewardship over creation. 9) There is a kind of ordering and structure. 10) There is the doctrines of last things that is anticipated by the first things. 11) The beginning of Sabbath is bound up with God’s rest. 12) the greatness of God is testified by his creation. 

> Psalm 33:6 &mdash; By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
<!-- --- -->
> Psalm 19:1,2 &mdash; The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. 2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
<!-- --- -->

> Job 38:1,4 &mdash; Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
 
<!-- --- -->
> Proverbs 8:22 &mdash; 22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. 23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
