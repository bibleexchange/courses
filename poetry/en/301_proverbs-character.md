## What Proverbs says about character

### Introduction

Wisdom will produce good character in us. Dave Bland, author of *Proverbs and the Formation of Character*, said that "Wisdom is not content to leave us as we are but insists that we allow ourselves to be transformed by the power of God." The goal of the wisdom books are to change who we are. We cannot expect this character to happen in isolation, but good character is produced in community. Bland also says that:

> Character, that cluster of virtues that forms into habits, is a product of one’s relationship with God and with other fellow humans. In as much as this character is the natural outgrowth of wisdom, it is important to realize that wisdom, as expressed in Proverbs, is relational. In coming into relationship with God and becoming involved in the lives of others, character takes shape. Character, being shaped by these relationships, in turn rejuvenates them, continually refreshing our love for God and for others.<sup>[1]</sup>

Good character is a valuable thing. Proverbs 22:1 says that it is better to choose good character than riches (see also 16:17, 19:1, 20:7, 20:11, 21:29, and 28:6). The value of good character is revealed in how it can keep us safe from the dangers of life. Proverbs 10:9 says that "He that walketh uprightly walketh surely" (see also 11:3 and 28:18). We will now look at some traits of good character.

### Righteousness

The book of Proverbs is not just a list of natural and moralistic rules, but these rules were founded on religion and a belief in God. The whole of Israel's society and government was permeated by a belief in God. Because of this, righteousness is an important characteristic in the book of Proverbs. Read Proverbs 10:6–7.

### Steadfastness/Perseverance

Things that will make us steadfast:

* Wisdom (4:6; 24:3)
* Prudence (4:25–27)
* Righteousness (10:25; 12:3)
* Trust in God (16:3)

### Diligence

> Proverbs 21:5—The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness;  
> But of every one that is hasty only to want.

See also 11:27, 12:24, 12:27, 13:4.

### Humility

God hates pride. Proverbs chapter 6 lists seven things that God hates. The first item in this list is pride (6:16–17a; See also 21:4). Because God hates pride He will punish the proud (15:25; 16:5) and we should share His hatred for it (8:12–13).

What does it mean to be humble? A humble person does not brag about himself (27:2; 25:27). When we are humble, we show that we trust in God (28:26). Humility brings blessings (22:4) and honor (15:33), while pride brings shame (11:2), contention (13:10; 21:24), and self-destruction (16:18; 18:12; 29:23).

### Contentment

There can be too much of a good thing. Contentment keeps us from overindulgence (25:16). Contentment values spiritual things more than physical things (15:16–17). It is easy to be envious of wicked people that have more than us, but we need to remember that money cannot profit in eternity (23:17–18; 24:1–2; 24:19–20). We need to learn to be content, because envy is never satisfied (30:15–16). This envy will destroy us if we do not stop it (14:30).

### Patience

Patience is a powerful characteristic. Proverbs 16:32 says that "He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty." The fool gets angry quickly, but the wise man is patient (14:29; 29:20). A patient person can make peace, but if we are angry, we will make other people angry (15:18; 19:11).

Patience in our work will bring results. Many people want get to get rich quickly, but diligent work has a better guarantee for prosperity (28:20; 13:11; 20:21; 21:5).

Patience keeps you from sinning (19:2), it shows trust in God (20:22), and it can change other people's opinions (25:15).

### Conclusion

In ancient Israeli culture, people were motivated by honor and shame. The shame of one person could shame their whole family. Proverbs says that the foolish son shames on his parents (10:5) and the foolish wife shames her husband (11:16; 12:4). A person of good character will have honor (21:21), but the person of bad character will have shame (13:5; 18:3).
