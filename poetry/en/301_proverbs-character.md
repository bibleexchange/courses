# What Proverbs says about character

## Introduction

Wisdom will produce good character in us.

> Wisdom is not content to leave us as we are but insists that we allow ourselves to be transformed by the power of God.  
> Dave Bland, *Proverbs and the Formation of Character*

### Good character is produced in community

> Character, that cluster of virtues that forms into habits, is a product of one’s relationship with God and with other fellow humans. In as much as this character is the natural outgrowth of wisdom, it is important to realize that wisdom, as expressed in Proverbs, is relational. In coming into relationship with God and becoming involved in the lives of others, character takes shape. Character, being shaped by these relationships, in turn rejuvenates them, continually refreshing our love for God and for others.  
> Dave Bland, *Proverbs and the Formation of Character*

### Good character keeps us safe

> Proverbs 10:9&mdash;He that walketh uprightly walketh surely:  
> But he that perverteth his ways shall be known.

      18       The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous,
      And the transgressor for the upright.-->

## Righteousness

The book of Proverbs is not just a list of natural and moralistic rules, but these rules were founded on religion and a belief in God. The whole of Israel's society and government was permeated by a belief in God. Because of this, righteousness is an important characteristic in the book of Proverbs. Read Proverbs 10:6–7.

> Proverbs 16:3&mdash;Commit thy works unto the LORD,  
> And thy thoughts shall be established.

> A proud look...

See also Proverbs 21:4.

#### Because God hates pride He will punish the proud

See Proverbs 15:25 and 16:5.

## Contentment

### Contentment keeps us from overindulgence

There can be too much of a good thing.

> Proverbs 15:16–17&mdash;Better is little with the fear of the LORD  
> Than great treasure and trouble therewith.  
> Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,  
> Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.

It is easy to be envious of wicked people that have more than us, but we need to remember that money cannot profit in eternity.

> Proverbs 23:17–18&mdash;Let not thine heart envy sinners:  
> But be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long.

## Conclusion

In ancient Israeli culture, people were motivated by honor and shame. The shame of one person could shame their whole family. Proverbs says that the foolish son shames on his parents (10:5) and the foolish wife shames her husband (11:16; 12:4). A person of good character will have honor (21:21), but the person of bad character will have shame (13:5; 18:3).
