(1) Literary Structure

Lament, acrostic structures, numerical sayings, and parrellism are all literary stuctures used in the psalms of wisdom and the other Biblical books of poetry. Parrellelism is one example of literary structure the psalms of wisdom share with the other Biblical books of poetry. Parallelism is a major characteristic of Hebrew poetry that can be understood as a balanced repetition:
