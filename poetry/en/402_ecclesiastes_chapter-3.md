## God controls the seasons of life (chapter 3)

This chapter shows us that there are many different seasons in life. These seasons are out of our control. We have to learn to trust God even if it is a season of difficulty. There are many ideas in this chapter that correspond to Jesus' teaching about trust in God from Matthew chapter 6. We need to live for today and not worry about tomorrow. Instead of looking for a better time, we need to focus on the time we have now.

### There is a time for everything (v. 1–11)

We know from other Scriptures that God is in control, and that He has a plan (Jer. 29:11; Dan. 2:21; Amos 3:6; Matt. 5:45–48).

### Man's God-given task (v. 12–15)

God has created humanity and the world. He has given us work to do. We are to do that work, rejoice, do good, eat, drink, and enjoy the results of our labor.

### Death and judgment (v. 16–22)

Qoheleth is discouraged because everywhere he looks he sees wickedness. But he knows that there is a season for everything, and though the wicked may have a season of prosperity, there will come a season of judgment. Jesus said to let the wheat grow with the thorns (Matt. 13:24-30).
