# Chapter 10 (Folly and Wisdom)

## A. Folly Disgraces, vs. 1-7

### 1. Folly Disgraces a Wise Man's Honor. v.1

- folly: foolishness, silliness;  lack of good sense or normal prudence and foresight; In the books of Poetry "folly" is used as the direct opposite of "wisdom". 

> Ecclesiastes 2:13 &mdash; Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.

(This is not merely an "innocent mistake", but has an inherent wickedness. Eccl. 7:25 "wickedness of folly")

- aphothecary: "perfumer," Also in Exodus 30:25 ; 37:29. The holy oils and ointments were prepared by priests properly qualified for this office. The feminine plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered "confectionaries" in 1 Samuel 8:13.
- Obvious Statement: Dead flies spoils the perfume.
- Compare with 9:18 "...one sinner destroyeth much good."
- So does a little folly to one respected for wisdom and honor: Even as small dead flies - quite little in proportion to the whole 

Examples of Momentary Folly:
- Esau with his Birthright
- Moses when Commanded to Speak to the Rock and he Struck it
- Aaron with the Golden Calf.
- Others?

Even though generally speaking "out of character" as Moses (Numbers 12:3), Even small things have consequences.

### 2. Folly Disgraces the Fool by Revealing Itself, vs. 2-3

-The right hand was regarded as the side of strength, skill, good and favor and the left hand was regarded as weak, bad and even "sinister" (In Latin means left).

>  "To have one's heart at his left side is to have the 'springs of life' (Proverbs 4:23) located in the realm of practical and spiritual incompetence." (Eaton)

- He shows everyone that he is a fool. He has a way of making his folly evident. 

- Jesus said wisdom is justified by all her children (Luke 7:25). Wisdom and folly become obvious in life.

### 3. Folly Disgraces in High Places, vs. 4-7

- "Leave not thy place" Even in a difficult situation, don't leave your post. Be faithful to your position.

Folly is set in great dignity:
- Some lowly men are unwisely exalted (servants on horses) Foolish men are promoted or accepted to positions of great leadership. 
-  while some noblemen are humbled (princes walk on the ground like servants).

- The Bible Teaches Accountability to Leadership:

> 1 Corinthians 16:16 &mdash; That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.

- The Bible Also Teaches Accountability in leadership (Ephesians 5 & 6; Husbands, Wives, Children, Servants).

> Ephesians 5:21 ¶ Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

<!-- -->

>  James 4:7 &mdash; Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

>  Ga 6:1 ¶ Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. 

- Not "fruit inspectors", but in "the spirit of meekness."

## B. Evidence of Folly and Wisdom, vs. 8-20

### 1. Foolishness in action., vs. 8-10

- Digging a Pit and Falling Into It
- While Destroying Property, unware of the danger to yourself.
- Working with a Dull Axe.

The fool doesn't wisely consider the future, but wise use of one's time in the present can make for a much better future.

### 2. The babbling talk of the foolish., vs. 11-14

- Babbler is like a Biting Serpent
- A fool also multiplies words The fool is known by his many words, and by his presumption about the future - when no man knows what is to be.
- "The word for 'fool' here is sakal, which implies a dense, confused thinker." (Deane)
- Previously the Preacher had confidently stated that there is nothing beyond this life, and that this life should be lived with an under the sun premise. He now casts more doubt upon that premise.

### 3. The fool at work., v. 15

> Ecclesiastes 10:15 &mdash; The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.

#### a. The labor of fools wearies them: 

The fool has no desire to work; or when they do they quickly become wearied. They can't see that it is wise to work now in order to prepare for the future. The Fool works hard to get out of work.

#### b. They do not even know how to go to the city! 

The Preacher continued to subtly back away from his previous under the sun premise. The fool has no sense of direction or goal. They live their life as if it were meaningless, directionless.

- "The phrase, 'how to go to the city,' seems to be a kind of proverbial comparison for anything that is very plain and conspicuous." (Maclaren)
- "In a fine note of sarcasm, this proverb says that a person may be so involved in arguing about the universe that he misses what the ordinary person is concerned about, namely, finding the way home." (Wright)

> 2 Timothy 3:7 &mdash; Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

-  One who manages to get lost on even the straightest way to the city. That is folly without even the excuse of ignorance." (Kidner)

### 4. How foolishness corrupts a nation , vs. 16-20

#### a. "Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child" 

> Ecclesiastes 10:16 &mdash; Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! 

Solomon himself felt that he was but a child when he came to the throne of Israel; therefore he wisely asked God for the wisdom to lead a great people.

> 2 Kings 3:7-9

- "A nation's first need is a mature leader. RSV is a child refers to age but to general maturity." (Eaton)

#### b. Woe to you, O land ... Blessed are you, O land: 

> Ecclesiastes 10:17,18

The Preacher understood that a land was blessed by good, faithful leaders, but cursed under wicked and incompetent leaders.

- Because of laziness the building decays
- If Ecclesiastes 10:18 pictures the fall of a nation, the following lines give the reason for fall - leaders who are foolish, selfish, and concerned only for their own pleasure and good.

> "They do nothing in order; turn night into day, and day into night; sleep when they should wake, and wake when they should sleep; attending more to chamberings and banquetings, than to the concerns of the state." (Clarke)

#### c. A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes merry; but money answers everything: 

> 19

#### d. The Ears of a King 

> 20

Solomon here spoke in the voice of a wicked, unwise king. Along this line, he counseled his readers to not curse the king lest they be found out.

- "Kings have long ears, heavy hands; walls also and hedges have ears." (Trapp)

- " 'A little bird told me' is a proverb which appears in a variety of forms and cultures.

- The thought is suggestive. A king may hear of my wrongdoing and I may suffer because of it, even though I did not know he could learn of it. The same is true of my wrongdoing before God.
- The concern of the King should be truth, but his pride is prioritizes and any dissent must be silenced -- corruption.
