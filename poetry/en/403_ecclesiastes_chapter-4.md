# Chapter 4 (The Study of the Social Evils Apart from Faith)

## Introduction

Power, Possessions, Popularity will not make it right. Only Jesus!

## The Oppressor and the Oppressed (Power) (v. 1-2)

- Power and authority does not always have to result in oppression.
- "Looks bad for those without the power" = vanity v.1
- "My life is hopeless, it would be better if I never lived." vs. 2,3

> 2 Corinthians 1:24 &mdash; Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.

> 1 Peter 5:3 &mdash; Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.

> 2 Corinthians 4:5 &mdash; For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.

> 1 Timothy 3:3 &mdash; Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; 

## The Haves and the Have Nots (Possessions)

> 4 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. 5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 6 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.

- Is it good to be envied? v.4
- The Fool versus those industrious and with possessions ... v.5

**THE FOOL**:  The man without aim or insight, leading a half brutish life, “folds his hands” in the attitude of laziness (Proverbs 6:10; Proverbs 24:33).

**EATS HIS MEAT**: Even he, with his limited desires, attains to the fruition of those desires, “eats his meat” and rejoices more than the wise and far-sighted who finds his work empty and unsatisfying. (Exodus 16:8; Exodus 21:28; Isaiah 22:13; Ezekiel 39:17)

Activity, diligence, and skill indeed bring success, but success is accompanied by sad results. Should we, then, sink into apathy, relinquish work, let things slide? 

No, for the fool, the insensate, half-brutish man, doth this. The fool foldeth his hands together. The attitude expresses laziness and disinclination for active labor, like that of the sluggard in Proverbs 6:10.

> Proverbs 6:10 &mdash; Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:

- (The Wall Street Journal, 2010) "The average net worth per person in America is **$182,000**."
- (2014 Credit Suisse survey) "Average net worth in America is **$301,000**!"
- Retirement age average networth (not including home equity) "$45,000"
- How much money do you need to be wealthy? Now you need an average of $2.4 million to be considered a wealthy person in America, according to the survey by Charles Schwab, which surveyed Americans aged 21 to 75. ... Only about 10% of Americans are worth $1 million or more.

We find meaning in our activity IN JESUS! ("As unto the Lord")

- 1 Timothy 5:8; Colossians 3:17,23; Ephesians 6:7; 1 Corinthians 10:31; Revelations 22:10

## The Alone and the Popular (Popularity) (v. 7-16)

- We are never truly "ALONE":
> Isaiah 41:10 &mdash; Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

- God saw it not good that man be alone:
> Genesis 2:18 &mdash; And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

But, without that in mind, what value is popularity? A day of fame? A moment of applause? As you will soon be replaced by the next thing.
