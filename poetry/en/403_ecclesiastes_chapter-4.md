## The problems of social evils (chapter 4)

### Oppression (v. 1–3)

Qohelet notices that those that are in power use that power to oppress others. These verses are used by some to show that Qohelet is likely not Solomon, because Solomon had power to stop oppression, but here Qohelet cannot.

As Christians, we know that power and authority does not always have to result in oppression (2 Cor. 1:24; 4:5; 1 Peter 5:3).

### Envy as motivation for work (v. 4–6)

We see here the observation that people will work hard because of envy. We see what other people have, and we want those things, too. We know that we can only have them if we work for them.

In verse 5, we see similarities with how the fool is described in Proverbs (Prov. 6:10; 24:33).

### It is not good to work only for yourself (v. 7–12)

Loneliness is not something that God wants for man (Gen. 2:18), and He promised Israel that He would not leave them alone (Is. 41:10).

### Government problems (v. 13–16)

Kings may be willing to listen when they are young, but when they are old, they no longer seek advice.
