## Psalms of royalty

Psalms of royalty concern the reign of the king, either historical or messianic, or both. The psalms of royalty are 2, 18, 20, 21, 45, 72, 89, 101, 110, 132, and 144.

### The importance of the earthly king

A modern Christian may wonder why there are special psalms that talk about a government leader. But we must remember that for ancient Israel, the king was both a government and religious leader. "The monarchy was, along with the priesthood and prophecy, one of Israel’s three fundamental institutions, and it takes a far more central place in the Psalms than either of the other two."<sup>[1]</sup> "The king was a substantial figure in pre-exilic Jerusalem. He ruled as God’s representative on earth and spoke to the people in that role. At the same time, the king, because of his special relation with God, represented the people in addressing God. The king had a kind of intermediary role."<sup>[2]</sup> There is a special relationship between God and the king in these psalms. God calls the king His son in Psalm 2:6. The king confirms this relationship when he calls God his Father in Psalm 89:26–27.<sup>[3]</sup>

David was a king, and he wrote almost half of the book. The kingship of David influenced the content of the book.

**Discussion:** Should we sing national anthems in church?

### The events in the psalms of royalty

We are not certain exactly how these psalms were used in the worship rituals of ancient Israel, but we can tell from their content that some of them were for special events in the life of the king.

#### The coronation of the king

Psalm 2 celebrates the coronation of the king. It shows that some people rebelled against the new king (v. 1–3). God had appointed the king for that position, so God would judge those that opposed the king (v. 4–5). Psalms 110 and 132 show that the Davidic kingship is a position chosen by God.

#### The responsibilities of the king

Psalms 72 and 101 show the responsibilities of the king. "As leader of the people, the monarch is to guarantee justice and righteousness."<sup>[4]</sup>

#### The king at war

Psalm 20 is a prayer for the king to have victory in battle. In Psalms 89 and 144 the king himself is in the midst of battle, and he is asking God for help. Psalm 18 is a prayer of thanks after the king has won the battle.

#### The wedding of the king

Psalm 45 is about the wedding of the king.

### The Messiah in the psalms of royalty

When the final version of the book of Psalms was compiled, it was after the Babylonian exile of the Israelites. This means that there was no king sitting on the throne in Israel. Then why did they keep these songs about the king in their songbook? It is likely that these texts came to be interpreted as a promise of the Messiah that would come to deliver and rule over Israel. The noun _Messiah_ (which is translated "anointed one") is used nine times in these eleven psalms, and the verb "to anoint" is used two times.<sup>[5]</sup> So we have two uses of these psalms: 1) a historical interpretation, where the _king_ is the Israelite king, and 2) a prophetic interpretation, where the _king_ is the Messiah, the Christ of the New Testament. So the primary reason that these psalms were included in the final version of the psalter was that they were a hope for the future.<sup>[6]</sup>

The New Testament affirms that these psalms were prophetic of Jesus. "The New Testament quoted from this group of psalms at least fifteen times, all of those quotations taken from Psalms 2 (6 times), 18, 45, and 110 (7 times)."<sup>[7]</sup> "Consequently, the New Testament draws upon these psalms to affirm Christ’s superiority: over angels, over David, and over the Aaronic priesthood. The writer to the Hebrews quotes Psalm 45:6–7 to attest to Christ’s superiority over angels (Heb 1:8–9). He also draws upon Psalms 2:7 and 110:1 for the same purpose (Heb 1:5 and 1:13 respectively)."<sup>[8]</sup>
