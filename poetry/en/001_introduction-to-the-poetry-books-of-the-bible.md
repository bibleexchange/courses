# Introduction to the Wisdom and Poetry books of the Bible

The books of Wisdom and Poetry are Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. (In this class we will not talk about Song of Solomon because of time.)

## Wisdom

### What is wisdom?

Wisdom is living according to God’s order in creation.<sup>[1]</sup>

### How is wisdom different than knowledge?

We see the words "wisdom" and "knowledge" many times in these books. What is the difference between these two words? Knowledge is having an understanding of something, but you can know something and not do it. For example, you can learn many things about a bicycle from a book. You can see pictures of it, learn all the parts, and learn how it works. But you cannot say that you can ride a bicycle until you get on it and practice. Many people have knowledge about spiritual things, but they do not apply these things to their lives (James 1:22&ndash;24). Having only knowledge is not enough (Pro. 26:7, 9).

Wisdom is knowledge in action. It is applying knowledge to life.

### There are three levels of wisdom

#### Practical: How to work, use money, get married, etc. 

#### Ethical: How to be honest and live among others (Pro. 20:10; 22:28)

In Proverbs 1:3, it talks about the wise person receiving "righteousness, justice, and virtue."

> Throughout the book of Proverbs, righteousness and wisdom are interchangable terms. One cannot be wise without being righteous. In the same way, folly and wickedness are inextricably intertwined. Foolish behavior is evil.<sup>[2]</sup>

#### Spiritual: How to live right before God

The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes deal with many practical things, but they are still spiritual books. There is natural wisdom in this world, but it is not as good as the wisdom that comes from God (James 3:13&ndash;18). We cannot have true wisdom without God. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge (Pro. 1:7). The rejection of wisdom begins with the rejection of God (Ps. 14:1).<sup>[3]</sup>

### Wisdom is not always easy

Example: Prov. 13:7; 30:33

#### God conceals some things (Prov. 25:2)

Not everyone is ready to understand deep wisdom, so God hides these deep things. Wisdom is a dangerous thing for a fool to try to use (Pro. 26:9). Jesus also hid many things in parables (Matt. 13:3, 10&ndash;13).

#### Many of the sayings are like riddles (Pro. 1:1&ndash;6)

#### We have to work hard to understand the meaning (Pro. 2:1&ndash;10)

## Poetry

These books are different from other books of the Bible in their writing style. They are predominantly written in a poetic style. Following are some characteristics of Hebrew poetry:

### Parallelism

This is when you have two lines in one verse that work together. Sometimes the second line emphasizes the idea in the first line. Other times it shows something the opposite from the first lines. Most times, there are only two lines, but in a few places, there are three lines. An example of parallelism is **Proverbs 18:15**.

Parallelism is the most common aspect of Hebrew poetry. We will talk more about it in the chapter about Proverbs.

### Repetition

This is when a word or phrase is used many times to emphasize an idea. It is like how in our modern songs, we have a chorus that is repeated. As an example, in Psalm 107, verses 8, 15, 21, and 31 all have the words: "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!" In Psalm 136, every verse ends with the words: "for his mercy endureth for ever."

### Simile

This is when two items are compared using the words "like" or "as." For example, in **Psalm 1:3**, the righteous person is said to be like a tree.

### Metaphor

This is when you say one thing is something it is not really. It is like a simile, but it **does not** use the words "like" or "as." For example, **Psalm 3:3** says that God is a shield. We know God is not really a shield, but it is said that He is as an example for us to understand that God will protect His people.

### Hyperbole

This is an exaggeration. For example, in **Psalm 12:1** the writer says that there are no more righteous people in the entire world. We know that is not completely true. Even when we feel like we are alone, God has many people that serve him (1 Kings 19:18). The writer was not lying because that is how he felt when he wrote the Psalm.

### Personification

This is when you talk about something that is not alive as if it was alive. For example, **Psalm 98:8**, says that the water claps its hands. We know that water does not have hands, but the noise of the waves is like the clapping of hands. 

### Stepped structures

A stepped structure is "a pattern of words or concepts in which the first and last are similar, the second and next to last are similar, and so forth, making memorization easy."<sup>[4]</sup> A stepped structure is also called a _chiasm_ or _inverted parallelism_. We will look at Psalm 1 as an example of this kind of structure:

```
A. Ps. 1:1-2 — Talks about the prosperity of the righteous, 
               in contrast with the wicked in v. 5-6.

  B. Ps. 1:3a — Righteous are like trees that remain strong.
                The wicked are like chaff, a different kind 
                of plant that does not remain.

    C. Ps. 1:3b — The righteous person will prosper.

  B. Ps. 1:4  — Wicked are like chaff that disappear.

A. Ps. 1:5-6 — Unlike the righteous, the wicked fail.
```

Stepped structures may be difficult to understand, but the important thing to remember is that many times the main idea of a Psalm is in the middle instead of the beginning or end.

### Acrostic

An acrostic is when the first line, verse, or stanza of poetry begins with the first letter of the alphabet, then the second line, verse, or stanza begins with the second letter of the alphabet, and so on. We lose this when we translate the Bible into our language because our alphabet uses different letters than the Hebrew alphabet.

Psalms 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, and 145 all use this structure. Proverbs 31:10&ndash;31 also uses it. Outside of the Wisdom and Poetry books, Nahum 1:2–10 and Lamentations chapters 1-4 use it.

### Numerical sayings

Numerical sayings are when a number is given, and then in the next line, the number is incremented by one. For example, in Proverbs 30:14, the leech has **two** daughters, the next line says there are **three** things that are never satisfied, and the last line says there are **four** things that do not say, "it is enough." In each line the number increases. This is done to build emphasis with each line. Other examples of this are Proverbs 6:16&ndash;19 and Psalm 62:11&ndash;12.

## Definition of wisdom

It is like emotional intelligence. _Fear_ pg. 10 begins a good introduction to this.

The first paragraph of Kidner’s commentary on Proverbs deals with the nuances of the type of wisdom covered in Proverbs.

Instruction, correction, and other related words. What do they mean?
