<!--# Introduction to the Poetry Books of the Bible

We need to follow instructions, and follow them very careful. 

Poetry covers from Job to the Song of Solomon. (Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon)

There will be memory scriptures, study questions, quizzes. 

Before the end of the year every student will be required to write a Psalm, from scratch. 

## Definition of wisdom

Wisdom is living according to God’s order in creation (The Baker Commentary on Ecclesiastes, p. 336)

Wisdom is applying knowledge to life. Just having knowledge is not enough (Proverbs 26:7, 9).

It is like emotional intelligence. _Fear_ pg. 10 begins a good introduction to this.

Longman in _fear_ gives 3 levels of wisdom:

1. Practical
2. Ethical (good)

In 1:3 it talks about the wise person receiving "righteousness, justice, and virtue."

> Throughout the book of Proverbs, righteousness and wisdom are interchangable terms. One cannot be wise without being righteous. In the same way, folly and wickedness are inextricably intertwined. Foolish behavior is evil.&mdash;_fear_ pg. 14

3. Spiritual

> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge&mdash;1:7

The rejection of wisdom begins with the rejection of God (Psalm 14:1) (_Fear_ pg. 16).

The first paragraph of Kidner’s commentary deals with the nuances of the type of wisdom covered in Proverbs.

Instruction, correction, and other related words. What do they mean?


> And wisdom sayings are notorious for the use of apparently absolute assertions in order to make a general, “proverbial” point.
