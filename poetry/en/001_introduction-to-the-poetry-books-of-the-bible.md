# Introduction to the Wisdom and Poetry books of the Bible

The books of Wisdom and Poetry are Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. (In this class we will not talk about Song of Solomon because of time.)

## Wisdom

### What is wisdom?

Wisdom is living according to God’s order in creation.<sup>[1]</sup>

### How is wisdom different than knowledge?

We see the words "wisdom" and "knowledge" many times in these books. What is the difference between these two words? Knowledge is having an understading of something, but you can know something and not do it. For example, you can learn many things about a bicycle from a book. You can see pictures of it, learn all the parts, and learn how it works. But you cannot say that you can ride a bicyle until you get on it and practice. Many people have knowledge about spiritual things, but they do not apply these things to their lives (James 1:22&ndash;24). Having only knowledge is not enough (Pro. 26:7, 9).

Wisdom is knowledge in action. It is applying knowledge to life.

### There are three levels of wisdom

#### Practical: How to work, use money, get married, etc. 

#### Ethical: How to be honest and live among others (Pro. 20:10; 22:28)

In Proverbs 1:3, it talks about the wise person receiving "righteousness, justice, and virtue."

> Throughout the book of Proverbs, righteousness and wisdom are interchangable terms. One cannot be wise without being righteous. In the same way, folly and wickedness are inextricably intertwined. Foolish behavior is evil.<sup>[2]</sup>

#### Spiritual: How to live right before God. 

The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes deal with many practical things, but they are still spiritual books. There is natural wisdom in this world, but it not as good as the wisdom that comes from God (James 3:13&ndash;18). We cannot have true wisdom without God. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge (Pro. 1:7). The rejection of wisdom begins with the rejection of God (Ps. 14:1).<sup>[3]</sup>

### Wisdom is not always easy

Example: Prov. 13:7; 30:33

#### God conceals some things (Prov. 25:2)

Not everyone is ready to understand deep wisdom, so God hides these deep things. Wisdom is a dangerous thing for a fool to try to use (Pro. 26:9). Jesus also hid many things in parables (Matt. 13:3, 10&ndash;13).

#### Many of the sayings are like riddles (Pro. 1:1&ndash;6)

#### We have to work hard to understand the meaning (Pro. 2:1&ndash;10)

## Poetry

### Parallelism

This is when you have two lines in one verse that work together. Sometimes the second line emphasises the idea in the first line. Other times it shows something the opposite from the first lines. Most times, there are only two lines, but in a few places, there are three lines.

Parallelism is the most common aspect of Hebrew poetry. We will talk more about it in the chapter about Proverbs.

### Repetition

This is when a word or phrase is used many times to emphasise an idea. It is like how in our modern songs, we have a chorus that is repeated.

### Simile

This is when two items are complare using the words "like" or "as." 

### Metaphor

This is when you say one thing is something it is not really. It is like a simile, but it **does not** use the words "like" or "as."

### Hyperbole

This is an exageration.

### Personification

This is when you talk about something that is not alive as if it was alive.

### Chiasm

Chiasm may be difficult to understand, but the important thing to remember is to look in the middle of a Psalm for the main idea instead of the beginning or end, like we usually do when we read something.

### Accrostic

We lose this when we translate the Bible into our language, because our alphabet uses different letters than the Hebrew alphabet.

### Numerical parallelism

We need to follow instructions, and follow them very careful. 

## Definition of wisdom

It is like emotional intelligence. _Fear_ pg. 10 begins a good introduction to this.

The first paragraph of Kidner’s commentary on Proverbs deals with the nuances of the type of wisdom covered in Proverbs.

Instruction, correction, and other related words. What do they mean?

> And wisdom sayings are notorious for the use of apparently absolute assertions in order to make a general, “proverbial” point.
