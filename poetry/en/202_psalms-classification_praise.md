# Psalms of praise

## Introduction

Praise is a wonderful and powerful thing. God inhabits the praise of His people (22:3), and praise can defeat the enemies of God (149:6–9).

The **psalms of praise** are 8, 19, 29, 33, 78, 100, 103, 104, 105, 111, 113, 114, 117, 134, 135, 136, 145–150. They are usually constructed around three key elements: 

1. A call to praise or introduction
2. A cause for praise (usually for God’s attributes or deeds)
3. A conclusion

The book of Psalms is organized into five books. Each book concludes with a doxology, with the entire book of Psalms capped by Psalm 150, a grand ascribing of praise to God.

* Book 1 (1–41) — DOXOLOGY: 41:13 
* Book 2 (42–72) — DOXOLOGY: 72:18,19 
* Book 3 (73–89) — DOXOLOGY: 89:52
* Book 4 (90–106) — DOXOLOGY: 106:48
* Book 5 (107–150) — DOXOLOGY: 150

Praise is an important thing for man, because if we are not worshiping God, then it is easy for us to worship something else. C. Hassell Bullock explains that:

> Exalting is a part of existence. It is so much a part of it, that when one has ceased to exalt God, something else must be exalted. Then God can be displaced by a man, an institution, an idea. Exalting remains a function of existence. World history demonstrates this. Man must exalt something, and without such exalting there can apparently be no existence.... If the praise of God, as the Psalms express it, belongs to existence, then the directing of this praise to a man, an idea, or an institution must disturb and finally destroy life itself. The Psalms say that only where God is praised is there life.[1]

## Organization

"Hans-Joachim Kraus... gives a helpful breakdown of the psalms of praise. His list is the following: Psalms 8, 19A, 29, 33, 47, 65, 66A, 68, 93, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 104, 105, 106, 111, 113, 114, 117, 134, 135, 136, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150. They fall into two divisions": 

1. those hymns that can be differentiated by form-critical methods:
	1. The imperative hymn, modeled on that of Exodus 15:21. The reason for praising is characteristically introduced by the word “because” (Hebrew ki). These include Psalms 96, 98, 100, and 136. 
	2. The participial hymn, which has its examples in Isaiah 40–55. 
	3. The hymn of the individual, examples of which are Psalms 8 and 104. 
2. those hymns that must be differentiated by theme rather than form: 
	1. Psalms of praise of the Creator: Psalms 8, 19A, 33, 104, and 136. 
	2. Psalms of Yahweh as king: Psalms 47, 93, 96, 97, 98, and 99. 
	3. Harvest psalms: Psalms 65 and 145. 
	4. Historical psalms: Psalms 105; 106; 114; 135; 136. 
	5. Entrance psalms: Psalms 24, 95, and 100.[2]

## Themes

### Creation

God is praised because He has created the whole world and everything that is in it, including mankind. "It is obvious why the topic of creation or the Creator should be a major object of attention in the psalms of praise—creation marked the beginning of world history, and all of God’s awesome deeds in history must be seen in the light of his majestic work of creation."[3] These psalms show us that God created with His word (33:6; 148:5–6), His deeds (147:4), His understanding (104:24–26; 136:5–9), and His power (65:5–8). Psalm 8 marvels the beauty of His creation and Psalm 134 and 149:1–2 encourage us to worship our Creator. Psalm 19:1–4 tells us that the natural world that God created praises Him. If the sun and stars praise God, how much more should we praise Him.

### Israel's history

* Psalm 105 tells the story of Joseph (v. 16–22), the sojourn in Egypt (v. 23–27), the plagues (v. 28–36), the exodus (v. 37–38, 43), the wilderness (v. 39–42), and the conquest of Canaan (v. 44). 
* Psalm 106 talks about Egypt, the Red Sea, the wilderness, and the exile. 
* Psalm 114 includes the exodus, the Red Sea, and the Jordan. 
* Psalm 135 covers Israel’s history between the tenth plague and the conquest (v. 8–12). 
* Psalm 136 extols the God who created the world (v. 5–9) and then skips to the sojourn in Egypt, followed by the Red Sea, the wilderness, and the conquest (v. 10–26).

### God's awesome deeds

Sometimes the psalms do not speak of a specific event in history where God acted, but they use generic words that praise His "acts." Following are some words used to show what God has done:

* “Awesome deeds” (65:5)
* “works” (105:1; 66:5)
* “wonderful acts” (105:2, 5; 136:4)
* “mighty acts” (106:2; 145:4, 12)
* “great deeds” (111:2; 136:4)

<!-- It is difficult to identify the life situation of these psalms. Some may have been written specifically for temple worship (for example, Ps 136), while others were personal expressions of gratitude for God’s mighty deeds and goodness (perhaps Ps 8), and later incorporated in temple worship, if they were incorporated at all. We should not assume that all of the psalms were used in the temple. In a sense the psalms were the “hymnbook” of the temple, but not in the sense that a modern hymnbook is written for the express purpose of worship in the church. The Psalter was a book of corporate and private worship. The psalms were written both for private and public use, and psalms in each category moved in the other direction, from private to public, and from public to private. ---Encountering the Bible, p. 309-->
