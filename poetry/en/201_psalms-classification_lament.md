# The Psalms of Lament

## Introduction

> A lament psalm relates an experience, so it conveys a narrative. It presents this within a metrical structure, so it is poetry. It asks for something from God, so it is prayer. It pleads a case, so it is argument. It expresses a faith, so it is theology. This list is but the beginning. The experience itself that a lament psalm describes has its own set of dimensions. It may be historical, it may be cultic, but it is certainly psychological and social.

> They say not only ‘I am afflicted’ but often ‘You have afflicted me’.

What are the "Psalms of Lament"?

These psalms contain a cry for deliverance or defense and are addressed directly to God. There are 56 psalms of lament.

As a noun a "lament" is a passionate expression of grief or sorrow. Some synonyms are:	wailing, moaning, weeping, crying. As a verb to "lament" means to mourn, feel or express sorrow or regret.

They may be national or individual. 

## National Lament

> In these psalms, Israel moves from articulation of hurt and anger, to submission of them to God, and finally to relinquishment.  
> The Psalms and the Life of Faith p 99

Chapters 12, 44, 58, 60, 74, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 90, 94, 106, 108, 123, 126, 137.

> Psalm 137:1 &mdash; By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.

(Read Psalm 80:1-7)

> Lament may be accusatory of God, often in a passionate reaching  out to God, when everything seems to speak against God. Psalms  such as Psalm 44 exacerbate lament into protest. Protest is 
understandable in the old dispensation, for undeserved suffering for  the sake of righteousness does not fit the paradigm of covenant  blessings for keeping covenant and covenant curses for violating  covenant (Leviticus 26; Deuteronomy 28). In the new dispensation,  however, Christians are Christ’s friends and he makes it clear to them  that suffering is constitutive of the Christian faith. As he suffered  innocently, so must they, for they are not greater than their master  (John 15:14-21; Rom. 5:1-5; 8:34-39). Consequently, a voiced protest is  not heard in Christ’s or the apostles’ teaching.

**Who is the "enemy"?**

> Patrick Miller has argued that the vagueness of identity  of “the hostile other” affords flexibility to the complainant for a multi-  tude of threats.¹⁶ Gerald Sheppard goes further, identifying “the  enemy” not historically, but from a socio-rhetorical context in which  the prayer was expressed in the presence of one’s enemies, as an ac-  cusatory public function of prayer.

## Individual Lament

> Moberly notes that “the predominance of laments at the very heart of  Israel’s prayers means that the problems that give rise to lament are  not something marginal or unusual but rather are central to the life of  faith. . . . Moreover they show that the experience of anguish and  puzzlement in the life of faith is not a sign of deficient faith, something to be outgrown or put behind one, but rather is intrinsic to the  very nature of faith.”
> The Psalms as Christian Lament, quoting R. W. L. Moberly, “Lament,” NIDOTTE, IV, 879.

Most of them begin with the words "have mercy on me, O God."

In these psalms of lament we find many questions addressed to God.

> Sometimes the psalm may include a protestation of innocence, e.g. ‘I wash my hands in innocence’ (Ps. 26:6) or a confession of sin, e.g. ‘For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me’ (Ps. 51:3), though often neither is present.
> Psalms, John Day, p 19

Chapters 5-7, 13, 17, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 51, 54-57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 69-71, 86, 88, 102, 109, 120, 130, 140-143.

> Psalm 5:1-3 &mdash; Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation. 2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray. 3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

(Read Psalm 64. David's whole life characterized by the type of struggles descriped and not not a specific occasion inspires this psalm.)

> By the  fourteenth century, in selecting a single verse from each of the  “Seven Psalms,” a tradition arose in personal devotion to link each  psalm appropriately against a cardinal sin. Psalm 6 was used against  Anger; Psalm 32, against Pride; Psalm 38, against Gluttony; Psalm 51, 
against Lechery; Psalm 102, against Greed; Psalm 130, against Envy;  and Psalm 143, against Sloth.

### Some reasons for lament

* illness (e.g. Psalms 6; 13; 38; 39; 69; 88) (Day, J. (1999). Psalms (p. 23). London; New York: T&T Clark.)
* slander (Ps. 64:3; 57:4; 140:3, 9)
* reproached by friends and family (Ps. 55:12–14, 20; 31:11; 35:11; 69:8, 20; 88:8, 18)

## Voicing Frustration to God

(Read Psalm 13)

> Psalm 13:1 &mdash; How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

How is this different from the grumbling against him, of the Israelites when they journeyed from Egypt to the Promised Land?

> Numbers 14:22 &mdash; Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;

- The Israelites spoke about God (as it were) behind his back. They spoke as if they had given up on God.

- The complaints of the psalmists are spoken directly to God. The psalmists have not given up on God but are expressing the opposite of that. 

- Whatever real emotions they had they present to God, but in the context of asking for help and hoping that he would answer them in their distress.

> Hebrews 4:13 &mdash; Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

> Psalm 139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.

## Believing in Deliverance by God

> Psalm 27:13 &mdash; I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.

(Read Psalm 108)

>  Israel also mixes  lament with praise, because they know beyond doubting that in  God’s unchanging, unfailing love they will be saved in the end.
> Christian Lament p 35

## Committed to Repentance before God

Psalm 51 is inspired by Nathan confronting David about his adultery with Bathsheba 2 Samuel 11–12.

> 2 Samuel 12:7 mdash; And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

> Psalm 51:1 &mdash; Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
