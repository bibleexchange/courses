## The Psalms of lament

### Introduction

#### A definition of a psalm of lament

What is a "psalm of lament?" These psalms contain a cry for deliverance or defense and are addressed directly to God. They are more than just emotional complaints to God, but they has many complex and varied characteristics. "A lament psalm relates an experience, so it conveys a narrative. It presents this within a metrical structure, so it is poetry. It asks for something from God, so it is prayer. It pleads a case, so it is argument. It expresses a faith, so it is theology."<sup>[1]</sup>

#### The structure of a psalm of lament

Most of the lament psalms contain four parts: invocation, complaint, petition, and conclusion.

##### Invocation

The lament psalms begin with and initial request to God. Many of them begin with the words "have mercy on me, O God."

##### Complaint

This section gives the reason why the psalmist is praying. It talks about the problems that cause the complaint. Some reasons for lament are:

* illness (6; 13; 38; 39; 69; 88)
* slander (64:3; 57:4; 140:3, 9)
* reproach by friends and family (55:12–14, 20; 31:11; 35:11; 69:8, 20; 88:8, 18)

Sometimes the psalmist also complains about God Himself. "They say not only ‘I am afflicted’ but often ‘You have afflicted me.’"<sup>[2]</sup> Sometimes the psalmist is experiencing the judgment of God, and he is repenting because of it. One example is Psalm 51, which is thought to be David's repentance after his sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11–12). Other times, he feels he has been righteous and that God has been unjust to punish him.<sup>[3]</sup>

In these psalms there is talk about the _enemies_. It is possible that these were real armies that were attacking Israel, but they may also be symbolic of people who stand against the principles of Jehovah.<sup>[4]</sup>

##### Petition

This section contains request for help and motivation or reasons why God should help. "Sometimes the psalm may include a protestation of innocence, e.g. ‘I wash my hands in innocence’ (26:6) or a confession of sin, e.g. ‘For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me’ (51:3), though often neither is present."<sup>[5]</sup> Many of these psalms contain questions addressed to God.

##### Conclusion

The conclusion of the lament psalm is almost always praise to God.

There are 56 psalms of lament, which are divided into individual lament and national lament.

### Psalms of individual lament

The psalms of individual lament are 5–7, 13, 17, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 51, 54–57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 69–71, 86, 88, 102, 109, 120, 130, 140–143.

<!--By the fourteenth century, in selecting a single verse from each of the “Seven Psalms,” a tradition arose in personal devotion to link each psalm appropriately against a cardinal sin. Psalm 6 was used against Anger; Psalm 32, against Pride; Psalm 38, against Gluttony; Psalm 51, against Lechery; Psalm 102, against Greed; Psalm 130, against Envy; and Psalm 143, against Sloth.

#### Voicing frustration to God

Many of these psalms contain complaints and strong accusations against God. For example, Psalm 13:1 says, "How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?" When the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, they complained, and God was angry with them because they complained (Numbers 14:22). How are the complaints in Psalms different from the complaints of the Israelites?

* The Israelites spoke about God (as it were) behind his back. They spoke as if they had given up on God.
* The complaints of the psalmists are spoken directly to God. The psalmists have not given up on God but are expressing the opposite of that. 
* Whatever real emotions they had they present to God, but in the context of asking for help and hoping that he would answer them in their distress.

Lament is very prominent in the prayers of Israel. This shows us that prayer of "anguish and puzzlement in the life of faith is not a sign of deficient faith, something to be outgrown or put behind one, but rather is intrinsic to the very nature of faith."<sup>[6]</sup> Sometimes we sing songs of only joy or praise, but when we remove the songs of lament, we conclude that "the hard issues of justice are improper questions to pose at the throne, because the throne seems to be only a place of praise."<sup>[7]</sup> The lament psalms teach us that "God matters in every dimension of life." If we do not bring our problems before God in lament, then all we have is anxiety and despair because of our troubles.<sup>[8]</sup> 

But what about us today? Should Christians express complaints against God? Protest towards God is understandable in the Old Testament, because in that dispensation two major principles were the blessing of those that kept the covenant and the cursing of those who did not keep the covenant. If someone who was righteous in keeping the covenant suffered, then it seemed like injustice. But in the new dispensation, Jesus and the apostles make it clear that the righteous will suffer persecution. Christ suffered, and He said that we would also suffer.<sup>[9]</sup> We should still take our burdens to God, but we should not be surprised by suffering.

### Psalms of national lament

The psalms of national lament are 12, 44, 58, 60, 74, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 90, 94, 106, 108, 123, 126, and 137. "In these psalms, Israel moves from articulation of hurt and anger, to submission of them to God, and finally to relinquishment."<sup>[10]</sup> In these psalms, there is a belief in the deliverance of God, but they mix "lament with praise, because they know beyond doubting that in God’s unchanging, unfailing love they will be saved in the end."<sup>[11]</sup>
