# Introduction to the Book of Psalms

> Mowinckel acknowledges both aspects when he says.
> In spite of the didactic character of the ‘learned psalmography’, it has one characteristic in common with genuine psalmography; these poems are, and must be considered as, prayers. Like every real psalm, they address God, even though they often address men as well.
> Mandolfo, C. (2002). God in the Dock: Dialogic Tension in the Psalms of Lament (Vol. 357, p. 24). London; New York: Sheffield Academic Press.

## General details about the book

* The book was originally titled _Tehillim_, which means “praises” in Hebrew. The English title of _Psalms_ is derived from a transliteration of the Septuagint’s Greek title _Psalmoi_, also meaning “songs of praise.”
* The poetry was often set to music, but not always.

> The writing of the book spans about 1,200 years. In such a large collection of hymns, a widely divergent range of dates is inevitable. The oldest written was the Psalm of Moses (90) and the latest written was Psalm 126, which was written in the post-Exilic period, which was in the late sixth or early fifth century B.C. This is a period of about one thousand years (1400–400 B.C.).

* Psalms is the most quoted Old Testment book in the New Testatment. Of the 287 quotes taken from the Old Testament found in the New Testament, 116 of them are from the book of Psalms. 

> Martin Luther influenced a transition from the priest-dominated worship of the Catholic Church to congregationial singing. Luther believed the congregation should take a more active role in the singing, but one obstacle to this was the complexity and difficulty of the current liturgy for the common person. He used the book of Psalms as the foundation and authority for his musical reforms, which included writing songs which were paraphases of Scripture in common language. An example can be taken from Martin Luther's "From Depths of Woe I Cry to Thee" (1483-1546, #329 In the Lutheran Hymnal) inspired by Psalm 130:
(I can't find the source, but I'm confident that this is a quote)

> From depths of woe I cry to Thee, Lord, hear me, I implore Thee.  
> Bend down Thy gracious ear to me, My prayer let come before Thee.  
> If Thou rememberest each misdeed, If each should have its rightful meed,  
> Who may abide Thy presence?

## Authorship

The book is inspired by God (2 Samuel 23:2; Matthew 22:43; Luke 24:44; Acts 1:16; 2 Timothy 3:16). Psalms is a composite work containing multiple authors. Some psalms name their author in the first line or title: 

* Moses wrote 1 (90).
* David wrote 73 (1-41 and 32 others)
* Solomon wrote 2 to 3 (72, 127)
* Asaph wrote 3 (50, 73-83) 
* Sons of Korah wrote 10 (42, 44-49, 84, 85, 87) ("Sons of Korah" were possibly performers rather than authors)
* Heman the Ezrahite wrote 1 (88) 
* Ethan the Ezrahite wrote 1 (89)
* 61 psalms are anonymous

## Psalms of David's Life

## Classification of Psalms

1. **Psalms of Lament** contain a cry for deliverance or defense and questions that are addressed directly to God. 
 * They may be individual (Chapters 5-7, 13, 17, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 51, 54-57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 69-71, 86, 88, 102, 109, 120, 130, 140-143). 
 * Or national (Chapters 12, 44, 58, 60, 74, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 90, 94, 106, 108, 123, 126, 137).

2. **Psalms of confidence** include a lament, but the ideas of security, peace, joy, and confidence predominate. 
 * They may be individual (Chapters 3, 4, 11, 16, 23, 27, 62, 121, 131)
 * or national (Chapters 115, 125, 129).

3. **Psalms of Thanksgiving** express public thanksgiving for what God has done or in anticipation of what He will do. 
 * They may be individual (Chapters 9, 10, 30, 32, 34, 40, 41, 92, 107, 116, 138), 
 * or national (Chapters 65-68, 118, 124).

4. **Psalms of Praise** are constructed around three key elements: 
 * a call to praise or introduction, 
 * a cause for praise (usually for God’s attributes or deeds), and 
 * a conclusion (Chapters 8, 19, 29, 33, 100, 103, 104, 111, 113, 114, 117, 134, 135, 136, 145 – 150)

5. **Psalms of Enthronement** of the Divine Kingdom contain the expression “the Lord reigns” (or, in the case of Psalm 98, “the Lord, the King”), and speak of the rule of God over all the earth. They are prophetic of Christ’s kingly rule (Chapters 47, 93, 96 – 99).

6. **Psalms of Zion** extol Zion, or Jerusalem, for its exalted role as the abode of God’s glory and as the religious and political capital of the nation (Chapters 15, 24, 46, 48, 50, 76, 81, 84, 87, 122). The Pilgrim Psalms (see below), are sometimes included here, but they do not really constitute a distinct literary type. 

7. **Psalms of Royalty** concern the reign of the king, either historical or messianic, or both (Chapters 2, 18, 20, 21, 45, 72, 89, 101, 110, 132, 144).

8. **Psalms of Wisdom** emphasize the traditional teaching of the wise men of Israel: meditation of the law, the way of the righteous versus the way of the wicked, and the necessity of practical righteousness (Chapters 1, 14, 37, 49, 52, 53, 73, 75, 91, 112, 119, 127, 128, 133, 139).

9. **Psalms of History** trace the history of God’s saving activity on behalf of Israel (Chapters 78, 105).

Other categories, identified strictly for content, overlap with the above. These include the following:

1. **Messianic Psalms** are prophetic in some way of the Messiah. They include psalms in which the righteous man’s character is a type of Christ (34:20; 69:4, 9), the righteous man’s experience foreshadows Christ’s experience (22), the existing king’s ideals and calling will be fulfilled in Christ, the ultimate King (Chapters 2, 45, 72), Christ’s work is prophesied with no contemporary reference (only 110), or the enthronement of Christ as universal King over the earth is predicted (Chapters 47, 93, 96 – 99).

2. **Imprecatory Psalms** contain an imprecation or prayer for retributive justice to fall on one’s enemy (Chapters 35, 55, 58, 59, 69, 83, 109, 137, 140). These may be justified by remembering that the Israelites were building a political kingdom and, as long as evil men triumphed over them, God’s rule was thwarted. The psalmists were concerned primarily with the glory of God, and at the very least, they did put the matter into God’s hands for His just dealing. These prayers are actually in the same spirit as the petition “Thy kingdom come” (Matt. 6:10), because the coming of God’s kingdom includes the destruction of the wicked (see the note on Psalm 109).

3. **Pilgrim Psalms** Song of Ascents is a title given to fifteen of the Psalms, 120–134, each starting with the ascription Shir Hama'aloth. They are also variously called Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps or Pilgrim Songs. Four of them (122, 124, 131 and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one (127) to Solomon. Psalms of Ascents were sung by pilgrims journeying up to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.

4. **Acrostic Psalms** are those in which each verse begins with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet (Chapters 9, 10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, 145). Psalm 119 is in a class by itself with eight verses for each letter of the alphabet.

(This classification comes from https://www.bible-studys.org/Bible%20Books/Psalms/Book%20of%20Psalms.html. I edited some of the words before I realized that they were quotations)

## Peculiar Language

The psalms include unique Hebrew terms. The word _selah_, found seventy-one times, is most likely a musical notation added by worship leaders after the Israelites incorporated the psalm into public worship. Scholars do not know the meaning of _maskil_, found in thirteen psalms. 

> The titles before many of the psalms are probably not to be considered inspired, as they were likely added to the text after David and the original writers composed the psalms. However, in trying to understand a particular psalm, some consideration ought to be given to them. These titles are very ancient. In the Hebrew Bible, if a psalm has a title, the title is actually the first verse of the psalm. Therefore, while they may not be original to the text, they are very ancient notes.
> http://www.shelbyvilleroad.org/informer/2017/3/14/on-the-titles-of-psalms 

> Because the titles are so old, it sometimes can be difficult to discern much from them. Sometimes the title tells us to whom the psalm is dedicated. “To the chief Musician” is a common dedication (Ps 18). Often, the author is indicated, as is the case with Psalm 90, which is “A Prayer of Moses the man of God.” Sometimes the occasion for the psalm is mentioned, as it is with Psalm 18. These notes are very helpful in interpreting the psalm. For example, David wrote, “I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, So shall I be saved from mine enemies” (Ps 18:3). The title to the psalm tells us who the enemy was: Saul.

> Occasionally, a psalm appears with instructions for the song leader. These and others can refer to melodies used with the given psalm or perhaps to suggestions for liturgical use. For example, we see instructions such as:
*  “For the director of music” (occurring in fifty-five psalms; 
*  “To the tune of ‘Lilies’” (similar references found in Psalms 45, 60, 69, 80)
*  “To the tune of ‘The Doe of the Morning’ ” (Psalm 22); 
*  “To the tune of ‘Do Not Destroy’ ” (Psalms 57–59, 75).

> One also finds musical terms in the titles. Much discussion persists over these terms, as very little is known about them. Some terms may indicate a tune that was known in ancient times (e.g. Ps 9, 22). Other titles mention the kind of instruments to be played with the particular song (Ps 4, 5).
> http://www.shelbyvilleroad.org/informer/2017/3/14/on-the-titles-of-psalms

> The identification of many of the technical words in the superscriptions is dubious. The headings include names for types of psalms (“a psalm”), musical terms (“to the chief musician”), melody indicators (“upon Shoshannim”, 45), and liturgical indicators (“for the Sabbath day”, 92). Fourteen psalms contain historical superscriptions that give some brief mention of the occasion on which the psalm was written (Chapters 3, 7, 18, 30, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, 142).

## Organization

### Psalms is a collection of smaller collections

> Psalm 72:20 &mdash; The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

Psalms were usually gathered in smaller collections occording to common themes, or words or style. From this great collection of psalms the Holy Ghost guided a subselection of 150 for Scripture. The fact the book of Psalms is collection of selections made form other collections is highlighted in Psalm 72:20. We find other psalms also written by David even after Psalm 72 (86,101,103,108). 

Different groups had different collections of psalms and when they were put together some duplicates were allowed to remain. There are resulting "doublet" psalms: Psalm 14 and Psalm 53; Psalm 105:1-15 and 1 Chronicles 16:8-22;  

### Within the Book of Psalms can be Found Smaller Collections

Short sets of Psalms were often used for various occasions. 

Psalms 113-118 are called the  "Hallel Psalms" or "Praise Psalms" as they start with "praise the LORD" and ends with "praise the LORD". The Hallel were sung at the 3 great Jewish festivals: 1. Dedication 2. New Moon 3. Passover. The Hallel are what Jesus sang with His disciples at the Last Supper - Matthew 26:30.

### Psalms Not Included in the Book of Psalms

* Moses' song of Deliverance &mdash; Exodus 15:1-18
* Deborah's song of praise &mdash; Judges 5
* David's lament over Saul and Jonathan &mdash; 2 Samuel 1:19-27
* Hezekiah's Praise for Deliverance &mdash; 1 Samuel 38:9-20

### Psalm is Organized into 5 Books

> Psalm is organized into five books or collections. They were probably collected gradually, as corporate worship forms developed along with temple worship. It is likely that by the time of Ezra, the books of the Psalter were organized into their final form. Each section concludes with a doxology, with the entire Psalter capped by Psalm 150, a grand doxology. (doxology: a hymn or form of words containing an ascription of praise to God.)

The five-fold arrangement has long been recognized, but no universally accepted explanation exists. The most common explanation is the early Jewish tradition that judged the five books to be an imitation of the five books of Moses.

1. 1-41 — Genesis — concerning man and his relationship with God. All blessing is bound up in obedience. Closes with a Benediction and double Amen.
2. 42-72 — Exodus — concerning Israel as a nation. The counsels of God concerning Israel’s ruin, redeemer, and redemption. Closes with a Benediction and double Amen.
3. 73-89 — Leviticus — concerning God’s sanctuary. Closes with a Benediction and double Amen.
4. 90-106 — Numbers — concerning Israel in relation to the nations. Closes with a Benediction, Amen, and Hallelujah.
5. 107-150 — Deuteronomy — concerning God and His Word. Closes with five psalms, each beginning and ending with “Hallelujah”.
