<h1 id="introduction-to-the-wisdom-and-poetry-books-of-the-bible">Introduction to the Wisdom and Poetry books of the Bible</h1>
<p>The books of Wisdom and Poetry are Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. (In this class we will not talk about Song of Solomon because of time.)</p>
<h2 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-wisdom-">What is wisdom?</h3>
<p>Wisdom is living according to God’s order in creation.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<h3 id="how-is-wisdom-different-than-knowledge-">How is wisdom different than knowledge?</h3>
<p>We see the words &quot;wisdom&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; many times in these books. What is the difference between these two words? Knowledge is having an understanding of something, but you can know something and not do it. For example, you can learn many things about a bicycle from a book. You can see pictures of it, learn all the parts, and learn how it works. But you cannot say that you can ride a bicycle until you get on it and practice. Many people have knowledge about spiritual things, but they do not apply these things to their lives (James 1:22&ndash;24). Having only knowledge is not enough (Pro. 26:7, 9).</p>
<p>Wisdom is knowledge in action. It is applying knowledge to life.</p>
<h3 id="there-are-three-levels-of-wisdom">There are three levels of wisdom</h3>
<h4 id="practical-how-to-work-use-money-get-married-etc-">Practical: How to work, use money, get married, etc.</h4>
<h4 id="ethical-how-to-be-honest-and-live-among-others-pro-20-10-22-28-">Ethical: How to be honest and live among others (Pro. 20:10; 22:28)</h4>
<p>In Proverbs 1:3, it talks about the wise person receiving &quot;righteousness, justice, and virtue.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the book of Proverbs, righteousness and wisdom are interchangable terms. One cannot be wise without being righteous. In the same way, folly and wickedness are inextricably intertwined. Foolish behavior is evil.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="spiritual-how-to-live-right-before-god">Spiritual: How to live right before God</h4>
<p>The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes deal with many practical things, but they are still spiritual books. There is natural wisdom in this world, but it is not as good as the wisdom that comes from God (James 3:13&ndash;18). We cannot have true wisdom without God. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge (Pro. 1:7). The rejection of wisdom begins with the rejection of God (Ps. 14:1).<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<h3 id="wisdom-is-not-always-easy">Wisdom is not always easy</h3>
<p>Example: Prov. 13:7; 30:33</p>
<h4 id="god-conceals-some-things-prov-25-2-">God conceals some things (Prov. 25:2)</h4>
<p>Not everyone is ready to understand deep wisdom, so God hides these deep things. Wisdom is a dangerous thing for a fool to try to use (Pro. 26:9). Jesus also hid many things in parables (Matt. 13:3, 10&ndash;13).</p>
<h4 id="many-of-the-sayings-are-like-riddles-pro-1-1-ndash-6-">Many of the sayings are like riddles (Pro. 1:1&ndash;6)</h4>
<h4 id="we-have-to-work-hard-to-understand-the-meaning-pro-2-1-ndash-10-">We have to work hard to understand the meaning (Pro. 2:1&ndash;10)</h4>
<h2 id="poetry">Poetry</h2>
<p>These books are different from other books of the Bible in their writing style. They are predominantly written in a poetic style. Following are some characteristics of Hebrew poetry:</p>
<h3 id="parallelism">Parallelism</h3>
<p>This is when you have two lines in one verse that work together. Sometimes the second line emphasizes the idea in the first line. Other times it shows something the opposite from the first lines. Most times, there are only two lines, but in a few places, there are three lines. An example of parallelism is <strong>Proverbs 18:15</strong>.</p>
<p>Parallelism is the most common aspect of Hebrew poetry. We will talk more about it in the chapter about Proverbs.</p>
<h3 id="repetition">Repetition</h3>
<p>This is when a word or phrase is used many times to emphasize an idea. It is like how in our modern songs, we have a chorus that is repeated. As an example, in Psalm 107, verses 8, 15, 21, and 31 all have the words: &quot;Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!&quot; In Psalm 136, every verse ends with the words: &quot;for his mercy endureth for ever.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="simile">Simile</h3>
<p>This is when two items are compared using the words &quot;like&quot; or &quot;as.&quot; For example, in <strong>Psalm 1:3</strong>, the righteous person is said to be like a tree.</p>
<h3 id="metaphor">Metaphor</h3>
<p>This is when you say one thing is something it is not really. It is like a simile, but it <strong>does not</strong> use the words &quot;like&quot; or &quot;as.&quot; For example, <strong>Psalm 3:3</strong> says that God is a shield. We know God is not really a shield, but it is said that He is as an example for us to understand that God will protect His people.</p>
<h3 id="hyperbole">Hyperbole</h3>
<p>This is an exaggeration. For example, in <strong>Psalm 12:1</strong> the writer says that there are no more righteous people in the entire world. We know that is not completely true. Even when we feel like we are alone, God has many people that serve him (1 Kings 19:18). The writer was not lying because that is how he felt when he wrote the Psalm.</p>
<h3 id="personification">Personification</h3>
<p>This is when you talk about something that is not alive as if it was alive. For example, <strong>Psalm 98:8</strong>, says that the water claps its hands. We know that water does not have hands, but the noise of the waves is like the clapping of hands. </p>
<h3 id="stepped-structures">Stepped structures</h3>
<p>A stepped structure is &quot;a pattern of words or concepts in which the first and last are similar, the second and next to last are similar, and so forth, making memorization easy.&quot;<sup>[4]</sup> A stepped structure is also called a <em>chiasm</em> or <em>inverted parallelism</em>. We will look at Psalm 1 as an example of this kind of structure:</p>
<pre><code>A. Ps. <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-number">-2</span> — Talks about <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> prosperity <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> 
      <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> righteous, <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> contrast 
      <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> wicked <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> v. <span class="hljs-number">5</span><span class="hljs-number">-6.</span>

  B. Ps. <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:<span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> — Righteous are like trees that remain
                strong. The wicked are like chaff, <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> 
                different kind <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> plant that does 
                <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> remain.

    C. Ps. <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:<span class="hljs-number">3</span>b — The righteous person will prosper.

  B. Ps. <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:<span class="hljs-number">4</span>  — Wicked are like chaff that disappear.

A. Ps. <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:<span class="hljs-number">5</span><span class="hljs-number">-6</span> — Unlike <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> righteous, <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> wicked fail.
</code></pre><p>Stepped structures may be difficult to understand, but the important thing to remember is that many times the main idea of a Psalm is in the middle instead of the beginning or end.</p>
<h3 id="acrostic">Acrostic</h3>
<p>An acrostic is when the first line, verse, or stanza of poetry begins with the first letter of the alphabet, then the second line, verse, or stanza begins with the second letter of the alphabet, and so on. We lose this when we translate the Bible into our language because our alphabet uses different letters than the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<p>Psalms 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, and 145 all use this structure. Proverbs 31:10&ndash;31 also uses it. Outside of the Wisdom and Poetry books, Nahum 1:2–10 and Lamentations chapters 1-4 use it.</p>
<h3 id="numerical-sayings">Numerical sayings</h3>
<p>Numerical sayings are when a number is given, and then in the next line, the number is incremented by one. For example, in Proverbs 30:14, the leech has <strong>two</strong> daughters, the next line says there are <strong>three</strong> things that are never satisfied, and the last line says there are <strong>four</strong> things that do not say, &quot;it is enough.&quot; In each line the number increases. This is done to build emphasis with each line. Other examples of this are Proverbs 6:16&ndash;19 and Psalm 62:11&ndash;12.</p>

It is like emotional intelligence. _Fear_ pg. 10 begins a good introduction to this.

The first paragraph of Kidner’s commentary on Proverbs deals with the nuances of the type of wisdom covered in Proverbs.

<h1 id="job">Job</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Job is thought by some to have lived around the time of Abraham. Some of the reasons we think Job lived at that time is because he performs his own sacrifices, he wishes for a mediator (if he lived in the time of the priests, they would have been his mediators), and the book does not talk about the Law of Moses.</p>
<p>Job was wealthy and righteous. He was tried and survived. The book is often reduced to a simple overview such as &quot;A Godly man tried by fire who maintained his integrity&quot; or &quot;a man who lost it all but was given twice as much because he held to God.&quot; But a closer look will reveal that Job addresses issues much beyond these. It is one of the only Old Testament books to mention Satan, it explores the relationship between God and Satan, God and man, and man and Satan as well as the relationship of good and evil. It draws boundaries on what can and cannot happen to a godly person. It makes us consider the depth of the character of God and even question His goodness and sovereignty. In the end it brings the reader to a sobering view of themselves, and while Job is rescued from his trial, the reader is left wrestling in his mind. The book of Job is a difficult book to understand, but it rewards the careful reader with hours of godly reflection sending us back to the scriptures to find the answers.</p>
<p>The book is named after Job, but the main character of the book is God. In it, God&#39;s policies are on trial. The question is if God is correct to bless people or if that will create people that serve Him only to receive good things. God set out to prove that Job would serve Him even if he lost all the blessings he had.</p>
<h3 id="obstacles-to-understanding-the-book">Obstacles to understanding the book</h3>
<p>The book of Job has a few obstacles that will keep us from understanding its deepest messages. We must start by naming some of them so we do not get off track as we study.</p>
<ol>
<li>The book is not about wealth. The wealth that Job has at the beginning and the end are seasons of grace and God was not required to give either. They display God’s affection for Job but they must take a back seat in our study. If the whole subject of wealth were removed the central theme would remain intact. Remember, Job himself never once cried over the cattle. Today, we would only care about the value of the cattle and houses. We would cry over the death of our loved ones, but Job is from the east, and his main focus is the loss of respect and honor in the community. This may be because of time or location or both, but it still applies in our day. Maybe that’s because he worked so hard to gain honor, and maybe we don’t think much about it because we’ve never earned it in the first place.</li>
<li>Job is not a place we go to study didactic text in search of doctrine. The narrative is an honest representation of the dialog of Job and his friends. To dig for doctrine in the oratory will lead us down the wrong road. We should rather step back and identity the overall movements that are taking place. The friends have many wrong ideas about God. Why are so many wrong ideas included in the book? Because it shows that the wisdom of God is different than the wisdom of man. </li>
<li>Don’t give up. The people talk a long time and say many things, and it is easy to lose focus if we forget the main purpose of the book. When trying to understand Job, read the whole book and try to understand how the smaller parts fit in the whole.</li>
<li>God does not change. The account causes such strong feelings of injustice at times that we begin to make excuses for God’s actions or allow God’s attributes to shift to make events easier to swallow.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-opening-narrative-chapter-1-">The opening narrative (chapter 1)</h2>
<p>No time is wasted here. Job’s character is described, his substance quantified, and then all is lost.</p>
<h3 id="job-is-innocent-1-1-ndash-5-">Job is innocent (1:1&ndash;5)</h3>
<p>There is no question that Job is a righteous and innocent person. It is stated by Job (6:30; 9:15), the narrator (1:1), and God (1:8; 2:3; 42:7&ndash;8).</p>
<h3 id="satan-1-6-ndash-12-">Satan (1:6&ndash;12)</h3>
<p>The word <em>Satan</em> is really a title and not a name. It means &quot;adversary.&quot; In all the Old Testament he is only mentioned a few times. Even more startling is that he appears before God along with the angels. It is not until the end of Revelation that he is cast out of the presence of God for good. How else could he be the accuser of the brethren unless he has an audience with God (Rev. 12:7&ndash;12). His presence reminds us that the adversary of the Old Testament patriarchs and Israel is almost always a natural force such as drought, famine, or a hostile nation. Here we have a quick reminder that the real battle is for the human race and their souls. As Christians we assume this has always been understood because Jesus exposed the devil in such a way the we are always aware of this fight, but the lack of text about Satan should remind us that this passage allowed the reader at that time, a special look into things not yet understood.</p>
<h3 id="who-s-in-charge-here-1-13-ndash-19-">Who’s in charge here? (1:13&ndash;19)</h3>
<p>Read verse 15. The Sabeans took Job’s cattle. If you did not know the story of what happened in heaven (which Job did not), we would assume that the Sabeans of their of free-will saw an opportunity and stole them. However, we do have the plot and we know that Satan made them do it. Satan could only do what God would allow, so God took Job’s cattle. The Sabeans were cattle thieves from the start and Satan only had to present them the opportunity. Satan was a liar from the beginning and the advisory of all mankind. He only needed permission to act, but God granted the authority for the action. This destroys the idea of dualism. If Satan must ask God for permission, then good and evil or God and the devil are not equal opposing forces as dualism suggest. Dualism is a view that robs God of his sovereign control of the universe. </p>
<h3 id="is-god-the-author-of-evil-">Is God the author of evil?</h3>
<p>Read Isaiah 45:7. The next question is not so easy. Is God the author of evil? We know that He created calamity for the day of calamity and that He could stop any act at any moment, but He allows trouble and suffering to continue. We know that He knows the end from the beginning. Nothing surprises Him. If He knows what is going to happen and can stop it but does not, we can reason that He ordained it. But we need to make a distinction here. Ill will toward someone is the evil present in Satan and the Sabeans. The will to allow trouble to happen to Job is with God, but it is not born out of ill will toward Job. Our mistake is that we see them as the same thing. God allowing trouble is not the same as Satan’s intent to hurt someone with that same trouble. So who is responsible? God, Satan, and the Sabeans are responsible, but all for different reasons. Do not allow your mind to reduce God’s character in order to solve this problem. Josephs brother meant it for evil but God meant it for good.</p>
<h3 id="job-s-response-1-20-ndash-22-">Job&#39;s Response (1:20&ndash;22)</h3>
<p>As the chapter comes to a close we see Job strong in his will to continue to serve and honor God. Verse 21 is one of his great statements of strength and dedication. Job coins some memorable phrases for us to look to in times of trouble and use in times of exhortation. Finally, notice the succinct way the chapter closes, almost as if the book is ending and Job has escaped with his life and integrity, like a storm that a ship seems to have outrun, surely this is enough for one man to endure.</p>
<h2 id="the-trial-continues-chapter-2-">The trial continues (chapter 2)</h2>
<h3 id="satan-s-second-accusation-2-1-ndash-6-">Satan&#39;s second accusation (2:1&ndash;6)</h3>
<p>As if the current losses are not enough, Satan asks for one more torture to place on Job in hopes of making him break. At this point, it hurts to hear Satan ask for this and it hurts for God to allow it. Our reaction reveals that we usually have a man-centered view of life rather than a God centered view. If God is good, then how can He allow these things to happen to Job? If we stand on the biblical truth that God is good, then we must believe that there is a greater purpose for His actions when they appear hurtful. The problem is we try to find a greater purpose for His actions that benefit Job, and in our own trials we look for a greater purpose that ultimately suits us. All this thinking is man centered. It is possible that we must suffer for God to receive sufficient glory and honor? Is it possible that the best overall outcome includes our suffering? This is taught clearly in the Bible (Philippians 1:29). Job forces us to realize that the word “good” used as an attribute of God must mean something different then what is convenient or pleasing to us as men. God-centered thinking places man low enough to be used by God at His will and for His glory to produce the best possible outcome. Practically speaking, the God-centered Christian life is the pursuit of God in such a way that we desire be changed by Him for his purpose and glory. The man-centered Christian life is that by works and prayer we change the will of God so that we benefit from his goodness in the way that is most pleasing to us. The latter is also the goal of all pagan religions and is why idolatry is the primary sin of the whole Bible. We do not like God so we change Him.</p>
<h3 id="job-s-wife-speaks-2-7-ndash-12-">Job&#39;s wife speaks (2:7&ndash;12)</h3>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Was Job&#39;s wife a bad person? Was she ridiculing him or did she want his suffering to end?</p>
<h3 id="job-s-friends-come-to-visit-2-11-ndash-13-">Job&#39;s friends come to visit (2:11&ndash;13)</h3>
<p>Job&#39;s body is covered in boils, he has resisted bad advice from his wife, and three of his friends have come to comfort and morn with him. </p>
<p>Chapter two concludes with seven days of silence. Seven days with no words! This may seem like a long time to us, but was common practice of mourning back in that time. An example of this is when Joseph mourned for seven days after the death of his father (Gen. 50:10). Jews today will still &quot;sit Shiva&quot; for seven days when mourning.</p>
<p>The following chapters will prove that in those seven days Job and his friends did plenty of thinking. Each have their own questions and answers. While they are talking, Job changes some of his ideas, but he maintains his innocence.</p>
<h2 id="the-debate-chapters-3-37-">The debate (chapters 3–37)</h2>
<p>There is no way to cover the conversations chapter by chapter without losing interest due to repetition. At the same time there is no way to cover them in one section of notes. So this next section is an attempt to bring out the main themes of the conversation between Job and his friends. The dialogue is lengthy and wordy at times. This may be due to their place in history, but may also shed some light on the disposition of the speakers. Let’s try to point out some common threads that are woven throughout this section.</p>
<h3 id="job-s-friends">Job&#39;s Friends</h3>
<h4 id="eliphaz">Eliphaz</h4>
<p>We can cay that Eliphaz is like a <strong>mystic</strong>. He gives the most weight to his lived experiences: if he has seen something to be true in his life, then it is the truth for everyone else, too.</p>
<p>He talks about his dreams.</p>
<p>He believes that the righteous can suffer for a short time, but it will bot be permanent.</p>
<p>By the end of the debate, he no longer believes that Job is innocent (22:5&ndash;9).</p>
<p>The speeches of Eliphaz are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chapters 4&ndash;5</li>
<li>Chapter 15</li>
<li>Chapter 22</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="bildad">Bildad</h4>
<p>We can say that Bildad is a <strong>traditionalist</strong>. He relies on the wisdom of the ages.</p>
<p>Bildad uses the death of Job&#39;s children as proof of retribution (8:4).</p>
<p>The speeches of Bildad are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chapter 8</li>
<li>Chapter 18</li>
<li>Chapter 25</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="zophar">Zophar</h4>
<p>We can say that Zophar is a <strong>rationalist</strong>. Everything is black and white to him.</p>
<p>He thinks Job is suffering because he is a secret sinner (11:5&ndash;6).</p>
<p>The speeches of Zophar are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chapter 11</li>
<li>Chapter 20</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="elihu">Elihu</h4>
<p>For most of the book, we do not even know that Elihu is there listening with the other friends. It is thought that he was a young man and so his name was not mentioned with the other friends.</p>
<p>Elihu only speaks one time, but he speaks for a long time. He speaks from chapter 32 through chapter 37.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-question-why-">The big question: &quot;Why?&quot;</h3>
<p>The question, &quot;Why?&quot; is not stated plainly in any of the discussion. Job does not have the luxury of knowing that this is a competition of sorts between higher powers. He and his friends never ask the question directly, but every one of their speeches contains an effort to answer the question, &quot;why is this happening to Job?&quot; </p>
<p>Their reasoning is centered on an idea that seems agreed upon by all parties: &quot;God blesses righteousness and punishes sin.&quot; This assumption leads his friends to the conclusion that Job has sinned. Because of this, Job is drawn into a debate where he defends his own righteousness. This prompts his friends to say that Job is elevating himself above God and they go on and on about the righteousness of God. Job agrees, but he realizes that they are only trying to defend their first position, and therefore he again defends his position.</p>
<p>If there is any fault in Job, it is that he is self-righteous, however do not forget that he was drawn into this position by a false assumption, three critical friends, and the worst tragedy recorded in the Bible. </p>
<p>The original assumption was, &quot;God blesses righteousness and punishes sin.&quot; This is called <em>retribution</em>. We all know this to be true on the surface and the Bible supports it, but there is not a one-to-one correlation. Jesus heals the lame man and says, &quot;go and sin no more lest a worst thing come upon you&quot; (John 5:14), and then in another case he is asked who sinned that this man was made blind and he answers, &quot;no man but that the glory of God may be manifest&quot; (John 9:3).</p>
<p>What Job and his friends are not allowing for is that there is another level, which only God Himself can see and in that place man may suffer without doing wrong. So in an attempt to answer why, and armed with an incomplete doctrine of the goodness of God, Job becomes more and more frustrated and confused as the discussion goes on. This condition leads us to our next point. </p>
<h3 id="the-mediator">The mediator</h3>
<p>Because Job cannot convince his friends that he is innocent, he begins to call upon the Lord for an answer. The point is made that there is not a man to stand between him and God (9:32&ndash;33). We cannot read this without recognizing the solution to the problem is Christ. We now have a mediator who is God and has been a man so that perfect mediation can be made for us. Job did not have this. The absence of a mediator caused him to ask for an answer directly from God. This is a request he will be granted, but will not enjoy.</p>
<h3 id="integrity">Integrity</h3>
<p>Though he made mistakes and was drawn into boasting and became bold enough to ask for a meeting with God, he did not sin or curse God. They did not try to misplace Job’s condition as some random act of chance as we would today. We would blame the fall, the world, sinners and so on to account for the suffering, but Job does not degrade God’s character by allowing this event to become something God did not see coming or could not stop. The event lies in the hands of God and Job is angry but does not curse Him. He is frustrated, but he does not sin. In our day, there is a lack of regard for keeping the commandments, but in the day of confusion and trouble the commandments are an anchor. They can be kept when we feel no love toward God, and in the simple act of keeping them we show that we truly love Him no matter how we feel. Jesus said, &quot;If you love me, keep my commandments&quot; (John 14:15).</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion-chapters-38-ndash-42-">The conclusion (chapters 38&ndash;42)</h2>
<p>We are ready for a rescue. We are tired of words that change nothing, we are tired of Job’s condition, and we are tired of wondering how God is going to keep His goodness intact while He explains to Job His perfect will for him. Then we read on and words hit us like a wrecking ball because none of our expectations are met. </p>
<p>In 38:2, God asks, &quot;Who is this?&quot; It’s Job, your faithful servant, surely you know who he is. The question is not, &quot;who are you?&quot; It is, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; And in 38:3, God said, &quot;I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.&quot; It was like He was saying, &quot;Since you seem to know so much, let me ask you some questions.&quot;</p>
<p>In two statements God has reduced Job to rubble. It’s not what we expect, but by claiming righteousness and wisdom, Job has encroached on God’s glory. He has trespassed into God’s territory. Before we can peruse true righteousness and wisdom, we must first be taught humility. This may be the most painful place in the whole book.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-questions-">What are the questions?</h3>
<p>They began with creation and moved on to the natural world. They speak of weather and animals and are filled with questions that Job has not asked or even thought of. Most importantly, Job cannot answer any of them. The central theme is &quot;If Job cannot answer these questions, he would not be able to understand why even if God told him.&quot; Also, the use of questions from creation seems to say to Job, &quot;only if you had been here from the beginning could you understand the purpose.&quot; Likewise, we cannot know the full reason for our trials. It is foolish to think we are worthy of an answer, and foolish to think we could understand even if we were told. Job is a God-exalting, man-humbling book.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-questions-">Why the questions?</h3>
<p>They initially come across as a statement of qualification. If you can answer any of these questions, then I will answer yours. It is a response to Job’s request for an audience with God. The Lord is saying, &quot;If you would like to speak to me as if we are on equal terms, then prove you are equal.&quot; The central theme is &quot;Job is not worthy of an answer from God.&quot; All knowledge of God is a gift, and all answers and revelations are gifts of grace. We feel so entitled to an explanation, and we can suffer quietly as long as we know how long, how bad, and for what purpose we are suffering. He did not reveal it to Job, and He will not likely reveal it to us. If we knew the purpose we would change our behavior and the purpose would be lost.</p>
<p>God asked Job questions about creation so that Job&#39;s trust would be restored in Him. In wisdom literature, observation of creation was a way to exalt God and learn about His wisdom. Even when Jesus was speaking about trust in God, He said to consider the lilies and the ravens as proof that God is in control (Matt. 6:25&ndash;34).</p>
<h3 id="why-doesn-t-god-talk-about-job-s-suffering-">Why doesn&#39;t God talk about Job&#39;s suffering?</h3>
<p>God says many things, but He does not give any answer about why Job was suffering. Job&#39;s test was to see if he trusted in God for nothing in return. He had to trust God even though he didn&#39;t know why these things were happening to him. If God revealed the reason, then Job&#39;s trust would have been conditional: he would be trusting God only because he received revelation from God. It would have made the test for no purpose. We cannot say we have faith if we must wait to see the promise to be fulfilled (Rom. 8:24&ndash;25).</p>
<h3 id="job-s-life-is-restored">Job&#39;s life is restored</h3>
<p>It is said that Job spoke true things about God, while the friends did not (42:7). How can this be said? Job said many angry things about God, such as in 31:35&ndash;37. There are two reasons we can say that Job spoke correctly about God:</p>
<ol>
<li>Job repented for some of the things he said (40:3&ndash;5; 42:1&ndash;6)</li>
<li>Job spoke directly to God, but the friends spoke to each other about God. This is the difference between lament and murmuring.</li>
</ol>
<p>After all these things, Job ended up having twice as much as he had before the trial.</p>
<h3 id="final-point">Final point</h3>
<p>When we struggle in life we wrestle with all the questions that come out in this book. When we read the Bible we often do the same. We can trace it all back to that one tree in the garden that was not like any other tree. If God knew what Adam and Eve would do, why did He put the tree there in the first place? Firstly, it was the opportunity to serve Him in a special way. More importantly, the world was created so that God could redeem from it a bride for His Son. For that bride to be perfect, she must be redeemed. In order to be redeemed, she must first fall. The purposes of God are too big for us to understand, let us rejoice that we have been given a part, and never forget that his own Son suffered according to this mater plan. &quot;Not my will but thine be done.&quot;</p>

<h1 id="psalms">Psalms</h1>
<h2 id="introduction-to-the-book-of-psalms">Introduction to the Book of Psalms</h2>
<p>The Psalms contain many prayers to God. Many are joyful and thankful, but others are mournful. When we look at the Psalms, we see they are very different than many of the prayers we hear in church. Many prayers are just repeating the same words over and over again, but the Psalms are long and contain many different words and ideas.</p>
<p>Jesus said in Matthew 6:7 that we need to avoid &quot;vain repetition&quot; when we pray. The heathen people think repeating words will convince God to hear them. The Psalms can teach us to pray with more meaning.</p>
<p>Not all of the Psalms are prayers. Some of them are praise, others are for teaching, and others tell stories.</p>
<h3 id="authorship">Authorship</h3>
<p>The book is inspired by God (2 Samuel 23:2; Matthew 22:43; Luke 24:44; Acts 1:16; 2 Timothy 3:16). Psalms is a composite work containing multiple authors. Some psalms name their author in the first line or title: </p>
<ul>
<li>Moses wrote 1 (90).</li>
<li>David wrote 73 (1-41 and 32 others)</li>
<li>Solomon wrote 2 to 3 (72, 127)</li>
<li>Asaph wrote 3 (50, 73-83) </li>
<li>Sons of Korah wrote 10 (42, 44-49, 84, 85, 87) (&quot;Sons of Korah&quot; were possibly performers rather than authors)</li>
<li>Heman the Ezrahite wrote 1 (88) </li>
<li>Ethan the Ezrahite wrote 1 (89)</li>
<li>61 psalms are anonymous</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>
<p>Psalms is organized into five Books. The five-fold arrangement has long been recognized, but no universally accepted explanation exists. The most common explanation is the early Jewish tradition that judged the five books to be an imitation of the five books of Moses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Book 1 (1-41) — Genesis — concerning man and his relationship with God. All blessing is bound up in obedience.</li>
<li>Book 2 (42-72) — Exodus — concerning Israel as a nation. The counsels of God concerning Israel’s ruin, redeemer, and redemption.</li>
<li>Book 3 (73-89) — Leviticus — concerning God’s sanctuary.</li>
<li>Book 4 (90-106) — Numbers — concerning Israel in relation to the nations.</li>
<li>Book 5 (107-150) — Deuteronomy — concerning God and His Word.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="questions-to-ask-when-reading-a-psalm">Questions to ask when reading a Psalm</h3>
<p>If you ask these these questions when reading a Psalm, they can help you understand it better.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Who is speaking?</strong> Is it one person speaking or a group of people? Sometimes the person speaking changes in the middle of the Psalm. Psalm 150 starts with a human praying, but in verse 5, God starts speaking.</li>
<li><strong>Why was this Psalm written?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What emotions are in the Psalm?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Of what genre is the Psalm?</strong> As we continue, we will talk about the different kinds of Psalms.</li>
<li><strong>Are there repeating words or phrases?</strong> When words are repeated, it means they are important. The phrase &quot;hope in God&quot; is repeated in Psalm 42:5 and 11. The words &quot;How majestic is your name&quot; are repeated in Psalm 8:1 and 9.</li>

<!-- Mowinckel acknowledges both aspects when he says.
> In spite of the didactic character of the ‘learned psalmography’, it has one characteristic in common with genuine psalmography; these poems are, and must be considered as, prayers. Like every real psalm, they address God, even though they often address men as well.
> Mandolfo, C. (2002). God in the Dock: Dialogic Tension in the Psalms of Lament (Vol. 357, p. 24). London; New York: Sheffield Academic Press.

## General details about the book

* The book was originally titled _Tehillim_, which means “praises” in Hebrew. The English title of _Psalms_ is derived from a transliteration of the Septuagint’s Greek title _Psalmoi_, also meaning “songs of praise.”
* The poetry was often set to music, but not always.

> The writing of the book spans about 1,200 years. In such a large collection of hymns, a widely divergent range of dates is inevitable. The oldest written was the Psalm of Moses (90) and the latest written was Psalm 126, which was written in the post-Exilic period, which was in the late sixth or early fifth century B.C. This is a period of about one thousand years (1400–400 B.C.).
> https://www.bible-studys.org/Bible%20Books/Psalms/Book%20of%20Psalms.html

* Psalms is the most quoted Old Testment book in the New Testatment. Of the 287 quotes taken from the Old Testament found in the New Testament, 116 of them are from the book of Psalms. 

> Martin Luther influenced a transition from the priest-dominated worship of the Catholic Church to congregationial singing. Luther believed the congregation should take a more active role in the singing, but one obstacle to this was the complexity and difficulty of the current liturgy for the common person. He used the book of Psalms as the foundation and authority for his musical reforms, which included writing songs which were paraphases of Scripture in common language. An example can be taken from Martin Luther's "From Depths of Woe I Cry to Thee" (1483-1546, #329 In the Lutheran Hymnal) inspired by Psalm 130:
(I can't find the source, but I'm confident that this is a quote)

> From depths of woe I cry to Thee, Lord, hear me, I implore Thee.  
> Bend down Thy gracious ear to me, My prayer let come before Thee.  
> If Thou rememberest each misdeed, If each should have its rightful meed,  
> Who may abide Thy presence?

## Classification of Psalms

1. **Psalms of Lament** contain a cry for deliverance or defense and questions that are addressed directly to God. 
 * They may be individual (Chapters 5-7, 13, 17, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 51, 54-57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 69-71, 86, 88, 102, 109, 120, 130, 140-143). 
 * Or national (Chapters 12, 44, 58, 60, 74, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 90, 94, 106, 108, 123, 126, 137).

2. **Psalms of confidence** include a lament, but the ideas of security, peace, joy, and confidence predominate. 
 * They may be individual (Chapters 3, 4, 11, 16, 23, 27, 62, 121, 131)
 * or national (Chapters 115, 125, 129).

3. **Psalms of Thanksgiving** express public thanksgiving for what God has done or in anticipation of what He will do. 
 * They may be individual (Chapters 9, 10, 30, 32, 34, 40, 41, 92, 107, 116, 138), 
 * or national (Chapters 65-68, 118, 124).

4. **Psalms of Praise** are constructed around three key elements: 
 * a call to praise or introduction, 
 * a cause for praise (usually for God’s attributes or deeds), and 
 * a conclusion (Chapters 8, 19, 29, 33, 100, 103, 104, 111, 113, 114, 117, 134, 135, 136, 145 – 150)

5. **Psalms of Enthronement** of the Divine Kingdom contain the expression “the Lord reigns” (or, in the case of Psalm 98, “the Lord, the King”), and speak of the rule of God over all the earth. They are prophetic of Christ’s kingly rule (Chapters 47, 93, 96 – 99).

6. **Psalms of Zion** extol Zion, or Jerusalem, for its exalted role as the abode of God’s glory and as the religious and political capital of the nation (Chapters 15, 24, 46, 48, 50, 76, 81, 84, 87, 122). The Pilgrim Psalms (see below), are sometimes included here, but they do not really constitute a distinct literary type. 

7. **Psalms of Royalty** concern the reign of the king, either historical or messianic, or both (Chapters 2, 18, 20, 21, 45, 72, 89, 101, 110, 132, 144).

8. **Psalms of Wisdom** emphasize the traditional teaching of the wise men of Israel: meditation of the law, the way of the righteous versus the way of the wicked, and the necessity of practical righteousness (Chapters 1, 14, 37, 49, 52, 53, 73, 75, 91, 112, 119, 127, 128, 133, 139).

9. **Psalms of History** trace the history of God’s saving activity on behalf of Israel (Chapters 78, 105).

Other categories, identified strictly for content, overlap with the above. These include the following:

1. **Messianic Psalms** are prophetic in some way of the Messiah. They include psalms in which the righteous man’s character is a type of Christ (34:20; 69:4, 9), the righteous man’s experience foreshadows Christ’s experience (22), the existing king’s ideals and calling will be fulfilled in Christ, the ultimate King (Chapters 2, 45, 72), Christ’s work is prophesied with no contemporary reference (only 110), or the enthronement of Christ as universal King over the earth is predicted (Chapters 47, 93, 96 – 99).

2. **Imprecatory Psalms** contain an imprecation or prayer for retributive justice to fall on one’s enemy (Chapters 35, 55, 58, 59, 69, 83, 109, 137, 140). These may be justified by remembering that the Israelites were building a political kingdom and, as long as evil men triumphed over them, God’s rule was thwarted. The psalmists were concerned primarily with the glory of God, and at the very least, they did put the matter into God’s hands for His just dealing. These prayers are actually in the same spirit as the petition “Thy kingdom come” (Matt. 6:10), because the coming of God’s kingdom includes the destruction of the wicked (see the note on Psalm 109).

3. **Pilgrim Psalms** Song of Ascents is a title given to fifteen of the Psalms, 120–134, each starting with the ascription Shir Hama'aloth. They are also variously called Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, Songs of Steps or Pilgrim Songs. Four of them (122, 124, 131 and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one (127) to Solomon. Psalms of Ascents were sung by pilgrims journeying up to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.

4. **Acrostic Psalms** are those in which each verse begins with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet (Chapters 9, 10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119, 145). Psalm 119 is in a class by itself with eight verses for each letter of the alphabet.

(This classification comes from https://www.bible-studys.org/Bible%20Books/Psalms/Book%20of%20Psalms.html. I edited some of the words before I realized that they were quotations)

## Peculiar Language

The psalms include unique Hebrew terms. The word _selah_, found seventy-one times, is most likely a musical notation added by worship leaders after the Israelites incorporated the psalm into public worship. Scholars do not know the meaning of _maskil_, found in thirteen psalms. 

> The titles before many of the psalms are probably not to be considered inspired, as they were likely added to the text after David and the original writers composed the psalms. However, in trying to understand a particular psalm, some consideration ought to be given to them. These titles are very ancient. In the Hebrew Bible, if a psalm has a title, the title is actually the first verse of the psalm. Therefore, while they may not be original to the text, they are very ancient notes.
> http://www.shelbyvilleroad.org/informer/2017/3/14/on-the-titles-of-psalms 

> Because the titles are so old, it sometimes can be difficult to discern much from them. Sometimes the title tells us to whom the psalm is dedicated. “To the chief Musician” is a common dedication (Ps 18). Often, the author is indicated, as is the case with Psalm 90, which is “A Prayer of Moses the man of God.” Sometimes the occasion for the psalm is mentioned, as it is with Psalm 18. These notes are very helpful in interpreting the psalm. For example, David wrote, “I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, So shall I be saved from mine enemies” (Ps 18:3). The title to the psalm tells us who the enemy was: Saul.
> http://www.shelbyvilleroad.org/informer/2017/3/14/on-the-titles-of-psalms 

> Occasionally, a psalm appears with instructions for the song leader. These and others can refer to melodies used with the given psalm or perhaps to suggestions for liturgical use. For example, we see instructions such as:
*  “For the director of music” (occurring in fifty-five psalms; 
*  “To the tune of ‘Lilies’” (similar references found in Psalms 45, 60, 69, 80)
*  “To the tune of ‘The Doe of the Morning’ ” (Psalm 22); 
*  “To the tune of ‘Do Not Destroy’ ” (Psalms 57–59, 75).
> https://books.google.co.tz/books?id=jIhMDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1170&lpg=PT1170&dq=Occasionally,+a+psalm+appears+with+instructions+for+the+song+leader.+These+and+others+can+refer+to+melodies+used+with+the+given+psalm+&source=bl&ots=g1WoY2bEAv&sig=ACfU3U2FuWiU_d-Xssd5SMsVF_MfTMByfw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiI95KYgIniAhXFZlAKHec4DXIQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Occasionally%2C%20a%20psalm%20appears%20with%20instructions%20for%20the%20song%20leader.%20These%20and%20others%20can%20refer%20to%20melodies%20used%20with%20the%20given%20psalm&f=false


> One also finds musical terms in the titles. Much discussion persists over these terms, as very little is known about them. Some terms may indicate a tune that was known in ancient times (e.g. Ps 9, 22). Other titles mention the kind of instruments to be played with the particular song (Ps 4, 5).
> http://www.shelbyvilleroad.org/informer/2017/3/14/on-the-titles-of-psalms

> The identification of many of the technical words in the superscriptions is dubious. The headings include names for types of psalms (“a psalm”), musical terms (“to the chief musician”), melody indicators (“upon Shoshannim”, 45), and liturgical indicators (“for the Sabbath day”, 92). Fourteen psalms contain historical superscriptions that give some brief mention of the occasion on which the psalm was written (Chapters 3, 7, 18, 30, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, 142).

## Organization

### Psalms is a collection of smaller collections

> Psalm 72:20 — The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

Psalms were usually gathered in smaller collections occording to common themes, or words or style. From this great collection of psalms the Holy Ghost guided a subselection of 150 for Scripture. The fact the book of Psalms is collection of selections made form other collections is highlighted in Psalm 72:20. We find other psalms also written by David even after Psalm 72 (86,101,103,108). 

Different groups had different collections of psalms and when they were put together some duplicates were allowed to remain. There are resulting "doublet" psalms: Psalm 14 and Psalm 53; Psalm 105:1-15 and 1 Chronicles 16:8-22;  

### Within the Book of Psalms can be Found Smaller Collections

Short sets of Psalms were often used for various occasions. 

Psalms 113-118 are called the  "Hallel Psalms" or "Praise Psalms" as they start with "praise the LORD" and ends with "praise the LORD". The Hallel were sung at the 3 great Jewish festivals: 1. Dedication 2. New Moon 3. Passover. The Hallel are what Jesus sang with His disciples at the Last Supper - Matthew 26:30.

### Psalms Not Included in the Book of Psalms

* Moses' song of Deliverance — Exodus 15:1-18
* Deborah's song of praise — Judges 5
* David's lament over Saul and Jonathan — 2 Samuel 1:19-27
* Hezekiah's Praise for Deliverance — 1 Samuel 38:9-20

### Psalms is Organized into 5 Books

> Psalm is organized into five books or collections. They were probably collected gradually, as corporate worship forms developed along with temple worship. It is likely that by the time of Ezra, the books of the Psalter were organized into their final form. Each section concludes with a doxology, with the entire Psalter capped by Psalm 150, a grand doxology. (doxology: a hymn or form of words containing an ascription of praise to God.)

They are more than just emotional complaints to God, but they has many complex and varied characteristics. &quot;A lament psalm relates an experience, so it conveys a narrative. It presents this within a metrical structure, so it is poetry. It asks for something from God, so it is prayer. It pleads a case, so it is argument. It expresses a faith, so it is theology.&quot;<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<h4 id="the-structure-of-a-psalm-of-lament">The structure of a psalm of lament</h4>
<p>Most of the lament psalms contain four parts: invocation, complaint, petition, and conclusion. To help us understand, we will look at Psalm 13 as an example of of the structure of a psalm of lament.</p>
<h5 id="invocation">Invocation</h5>
<p>The lament psalms begin with and initial request to God. Many of them begin with the words &quot;have mercy on me, O God.&quot;</p>
<p><em>In our example of Psalm 13, the invocation is 13:1.</em></p>
<h5 id="complaint">Complaint</h5>
<p>This section gives the reason why the psalmist is praying. It talks about the problems that cause the complaint. Some reasons for lament are:</p>
<ul>
<li>illness (6; 13; 38; 39; 69; 88)</li>
<li>slander (64:3; 57:4; 140:3, 9)</li>
<li>reproach by friends and family (55:12–14, 20; 31:11; 35:11; 69:8, 20; 88:8, 18)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the psalmist also complains about God Himself. &quot;They say not only ‘I am afflicted’ but often ‘You have afflicted me.’&quot;<sup>[2]</sup> Sometimes the psalmist is experiencing the judgment of God, and he is repenting because of it. One example is Psalm 51, which is thought to be David&#39;s repentance after his sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11–12). Other times, he feels he has been righteous and that God has been unjust to punish him.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p>In these psalms there is talk about the <em>enemies</em>. It is possible that these were real armies that were attacking Israel, but they may also be symbolic of people who stand against the principles of Jehovah.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
<p><em>In our example, the complaint is 13:2.</em></p>
<h5 id="petition">Petition</h5>
<p>This section contains request for help and motivation or reasons why God should help. &quot;Sometimes the psalm may include a protestation of innocence, e.g. ‘I wash my hands in innocence’ (26:6) or a confession of sin, e.g. ‘For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me’ (51:3), though often neither is present.&quot;<sup>[5]</sup> Many of these psalms contain questions addressed to God.</p>
<p><em>In our example, the petition is 13:3&ndash;4.</em></p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The conclusion of the lament psalm is almost always praise to God. It is amazing to see the speaker change from feeling very discouraged to feeling hopeful in God. It is possible that after the petition and before the conclusion that the priest performed some unwritten blessing that caused the speaker to regain their hope in God.</p>
<p><em>In our example, the conclusion is 13:5&ndash;6.</em></p>
<h3 id="psalms-of-individual-lament">Psalms of individual lament</h3>
<p>There are 56 psalms of lament, which are divided into individual lament and national lament.</p>
<p>The psalms of individual lament are 5–7, 13, 17, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 35, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43, 51, 54–57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 69–71, 86, 88, 102, 109, 120, 130, 140–143.</p>
<h3 id="psalms-of-national-lament">Psalms of national lament</h3>
<p>The psalms of national lament are 12, 44, 58, 60, 74, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, 85, 90, 94, 106, 108, 123, 126, and 137. &quot;In these psalms, Israel moves from articulation of hurt and anger, to submission of them to God, and finally to relinquishment.&quot;<sup>[6]</sup> In these psalms, there is a belief in the deliverance of God, but they mix &quot;lament with praise, because they know beyond doubting that in God’s unchanging, unfailing love they will be saved in the end.&quot;<sup>[7]</sup></p>
<h3 id="voicing-frustration-to-god">Voicing frustration to God</h3>
<p>Many of these psalms contain complaints and strong accusations against God. For example, Psalm 13:1 says, &quot;How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?&quot; When the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, they complained, and God was angry with them because they complained (Numbers 14:26&ndash;30). How are the complaints in Psalms different from the complaints of the Israelites?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Israelites spoke about God (as it were) behind his back. They spoke as if they had given up on God.</li>
<li>The complaints of the psalmists are spoken directly to God. The psalmists have not given up on God but are expressing the opposite of that. </li>
<li>Whatever real emotions they had they present to God, but in the context of asking for help and hoping that he would answer them in their distress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lament is very prominent in the prayers of Israel. This shows us that prayer of &quot;anguish and puzzlement in the life of faith is not a sign of deficient faith, something to be outgrown or put behind one, but rather is intrinsic to the very nature of faith.&quot;<sup>[8]</sup> Sometimes we sing songs of only joy or praise, but when we remove the songs of lament, we conclude that &quot;the hard issues of justice are improper questions to pose at the throne, because the throne seems to be only a place of praise.&quot;<sup>[9]</sup> The lament psalms teach us that &quot;God matters in every dimension of life.&quot; If we do not bring our problems before God in lament, then all we have is anxiety and despair because of our troubles.<sup>[10]</sup> </p>
<p>But what about us today? Should Christians express complaints against God? Protest towards God is understandable in the Old Testament, because in that dispensation two major principles were the blessing of those that kept the covenant and the cursing of those who did not keep the covenant. If someone who was righteous in keeping the covenant suffered, then it seemed like injustice. But in the new dispensation, Jesus and the apostles make it clear that the righteous will suffer persecution. Christ suffered, and He said that we would also suffer (John 6:33).<sup>[11]</sup> We should still take our burdens to God, but we should not be surprised by suffering. We should not be afraid to share our feelings with God, because He already knows the thoughts of our hearts even if we do not speak them (Psalm 139:1&ndash;4).</p>

<!--By the fourteenth century, in selecting a single verse from each of the “Seven Psalms,” a tradition arose in personal devotion to link each psalm appropriately against a cardinal sin. Psalm 6 was used against Anger; Psalm 32, against Pride; Psalm 38, against Gluttony; Psalm 51, against Lechery; Psalm 102, against Greed; Psalm 130, against Envy; and Psalm 143, against Sloth.

<h2 id="psalms-of-praise">Psalms of praise</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Praise is a wonderful and powerful thing. God inhabits the praise of His people (22:3), and praise can defeat the enemies of God (149:6–9). The <strong>psalms of praise</strong> are 8, 19, 29, 33, 65, 78, 100, 103, 104, 105, 111, 113, 114, 117, 134, 135, 136, and 145–150.</p>
<p>Praise is an important thing for man, because if we are not worshiping God, then it is easy for us to worship something else. C. Hassell Bullock explains that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exalting is a part of existence. It is so much a part of it, that when one has ceased to exalt God, something else must be exalted. Then God can be displaced by a man, an institution, an idea. Exalting remains a function of existence. World history demonstrates this. Man must exalt something, and without such exalting there can apparently be no existence.... If the praise of God, as the Psalms express it, belongs to existence, then the directing of this praise to a man, an idea, or an institution must disturb and finally destroy life itself. The Psalms say that only where God is praised is there life.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<h4 id="creation">Creation</h4>
<p>God is praised because He has created the whole world and everything that is in it, including mankind. &quot;It is obvious why the topic of creation or the Creator should be a major object of attention in the psalms of praise—creation marked the beginning of world history, and all of God’s awesome deeds in history must be seen in the light of his majestic work of creation.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup> </p>
<p>These psalms show us that God created with: </p>
<ul>
<li>His word (33:6; 148:5–6), </li>
<li>His deeds (147:4), </li>
<li>His understanding (104:24–26; 136:5–9), </li>
<li>and His power (65:5–8).</li>
</ul>
<p>Psalm 8 marvels the beauty of His creation and Psalm 134 and 149:1–2 encourage us to worship our Creator. Psalm 19:1–6 tells us that the natural world that God created praises Him. If the sun and stars praise God, how much more should we praise Him.</p>
<h4 id="israel-s-history">Israel&#39;s history</h4>
<ol>
<li>Psalm 105 tells the story of Joseph (v. 16–22), the sojourn in Egypt (v. 23–27), the plagues (v. 28–36), the exodus (v. 37–38, 43), the wilderness (v. 39–42), and the conquest of Canaan (v. 44). </li>
<li>Psalm 106 talks about Egypt, the Red Sea, the wilderness, and the exile. </li>
<li>Psalm 114 includes the exodus, the Red Sea, and the Jordan. </li>
<li>Psalm 135 covers Israel’s history between the tenth plague and the conquest (v. 8–12). </li>
<li>Psalm 136 extols the God who created the world (v. 5–9) and then skips to the sojourn in Egypt, followed by the Red Sea, the wilderness, and the conquest (v. 10–26).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="god-s-awesome-deeds">God&#39;s awesome deeds</h4>
<p>Sometimes the psalms do not speak of a specific event in history where God acted, but they use generic words that praise His &quot;acts.&quot; Following are some words used to show what God has done:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Awesome deeds” (65:5)</li>
<li>“works” (105:1; 66:5)</li>
<li>“wonderful acts” (105:2, 5; 136:4)</li>

<!-- It is difficult to identify the life situation of these psalms. Some may have been written specifically for temple worship (for example, Ps 136), while others were personal expressions of gratitude for God’s mighty deeds and goodness (perhaps Ps 8), and later incorporated in temple worship, if they were incorporated at all. We should not assume that all of the psalms were used in the temple. In a sense the psalms were the “hymnbook” of the temple, but not in the sense that a modern hymnbook is written for the express purpose of worship in the church. The Psalter was a book of corporate and private worship. The psalms were written both for private and public use, and psalms in each category moved in the other direction, from private to public, and from public to private. ---Encountering the Bible, p. 309-->
<!--"Hans-Joachim Kraus... gives a helpful breakdown of the psalms of praise. His list is the following: Psalms 8, 19A, 29, 33, 47, 65, 66A, 68, 93, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 104, 105, 106, 111, 113, 114, 117, 134, 135, 136, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150. They fall into two divisions": 

1. those hymns that can be differentiated by form-critical methods:
    1. The imperative hymn, modeled on that of Exodus 15:21. The reason for praising is characteristically introduced by the word “because” (Hebrew ki). These include Psalms 96, 98, 100, and 136. 
    2. The participial hymn, which has its examples in Isaiah 40–55. 
    3. The hymn of the individual, examples of which are Psalms 8 and 104. 
2. those hymns that must be differentiated by theme rather than form: 
    1. Psalms of praise of the Creator: Psalms 8, 19A, 33, 104, and 136. 
    2. Psalms of Yahweh as king: Psalms 47, 93, 96, 97, 98, and 99. 
    3. Harvest psalms: Psalms 65 and 145. 
    4. Historical psalms: Psalms 105; 106; 114; 135; 136. 
    5. Entrance psalms: Psalms 24, 95, and 100.<sup>[2]</sup>-->
<h2 id="the-psalms-of-thanksgiving">The psalms of thanksgiving</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>What are the psalms of thanksgiving? They express thanksgiving for what God has done or in anticipation of what He will do. They are very much like the psalms of praise, but what makes them different is that include a report of deliverance from a specific crisis. They are like testimony. They may be individual (9, 10, 30, 32, 34, 40, 41, 92, 107, 116, 138), or national (66–68, 118, 124).</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-the-psalm-of-thanksgiving">Structure of the psalm of thanksgiving</h3>
<p>The structure between these psalms can vary, but they usually contain an <strong>introduction</strong>, a <strong>narrative</strong>, and a <strong>conclusion</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>The introduction is different in each of these psalms, as can be seen by comparing the introductions to Psalms 30, 92, and 118. In Psalm 30:1 the psalmist states that he will praise God, Psalm 92:1–4 shows that praising God is a good thing, and Psalm 118:1 is a call for others to praise God. Though they are different, all of them encourage praise to God.</p>
<h4 id="narrative">Narrative</h4>
<p>This can contain the <strong>crisis</strong>, a <strong>plea for help</strong>, and a <strong>report of deliverance</strong>. The report of deliverance is what sets the psalms of thanksgiving apart from the other psalms.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Like the conclusion, this varies in the different psalms. Some of them end with a call to praise, and others such as Psalm 32: 8–10, 18:25–36, 32:8–10, and 92:12–15 end with instruction for those that are listening.</p>
<p>As an example, following is the structure of Psalm 30:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-number">1.</span> Introduction (v. <span class="hljs-number">1</span>–<span class="hljs-number">5</span>)

  c. Deliverance (v. <span class="hljs-number">11</span>)
<span class="hljs-number">3.</span> Conclusion (v. <span class="hljs-number">12</span>)
</code></pre><p><strong>Homework:</strong> find the structure of Psalm 116.</p>
<h3 id="temple-ceremony-in-the-psalms-of-thanksgiving">Temple ceremony in the psalms of thanksgiving</h3>
<p>We can see from Psalms 66:13, 92:13, and 116:19 that these psalms were said in the temple. Sacrifices and vows to make sacrifices are mentioned in 66:13–15, 107:22, 116:17–19, and 118:27. It is believed that these psalms were said before a sacrifice of thanksgiving was made.<sup>[1]</sup> We can read about this thank offering in Lev. 7:11 and 22:29. &quot;116:13 also refers to the cup of salvation, which is usually thought to indicate a drink offering rather than being a mere metaphor.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup> See Leviticus 23:13.</p>
<p>Since these psalms were sung in the temple, they were a part of public and not private worship. There are many references in these psalms to the people listening. They are called &quot;those who fear God&quot; (66:16), &quot;God&#39;s people&quot; (116:14, 18–19), &quot;saints&quot; (30:4; 31:23), and the &quot;righteous&quot; (32:11). The singer encourages those listening to thank God (such as in 118:1–4). It&#39;s possible that the congregation joined with the lead singer in 118:24–27, because it changes from using the singular pronoun &quot;I&quot; to the plural &quot;we.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But did every individual who escaped a life-threatening crisis compose a psalm as an expression and instrument of his gratitude? It is hardly possible that the capabilities of the common worshiper would have come up to that level of literary accomplishment. What we have in the Psalter is most likely samples of songs that accomplished composers had provided for use in the temple for the purpose of the thanksgiving ritual, even though some of these writers could have been common worshipers.

<!--Mays has pointed out that the cycle of trouble-prayer-help is not complete without “specific and public acts of gratitude.” Gratitude is a spiritual virtue that opens the door of the soul to the world around us. It creates a centrifugal force that causes the individual to look away from the self to God and to fellow human beings. It is not self-generating but stems from something outside oneself.

<h2 id="psalms-of-confidence">Psalms of confidence</h2>
<p>Many of the psalms express trust in God, but in a few of them trust is the main theme. These are called the <em>psalms of confidence</em>. Our study of the psalms of confidence appropriately follows our study of the psalms of lament which are dominated by disappointment and questions addressed to God. Meanwhile, the psalms of confidence are characterized by their attitude of faith, trust, and sense of security in God. The psalmist expresses his confidence by saying &quot;I know&quot; (4:3) and &quot;I believe&quot; (27:13). The individual psalms of confidence are 3, 4, 11, 16, 23, 27, 62, and 131. The corporate ones are 115, 121, 125, and 129. (Some classify 3 as lament and 129 as thanksgiving<sup>[1]</sup> instead of confidence. Also, some consider 73, 90, and 126 to be psalms of confidence.<sup>[2]</sup>)</p>
<p>Confidence psalms have similarities with lament and thanksgiving psalms, but they are distinct from them. &quot;The psalmist neither requests God to deliver him from enemies or other evils, nor thanks him for having done so, but rather expresses confidence that God does so.&quot;<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p>It may contain a request or a lament, but these are overshadowed by a strong proclamation of confidence in God. Psalm 4 is a good example of this. It has a request to God in verse 1 and a lament in verse 2, but then the rest of the psalm speaks about trust in God. The lament &quot;may be only a memory of the trouble that shaped and directed the psalmist’s sense of trust in God.&quot;<sup>[4]</sup> &quot;It is not a lament as such, but the remnant of one. In virtually all of these psalms... the language suggests some crisis that the psalmist has endured that taught him to trust in the Lord. It was an experience that shaped the faith of the psalmist, and out of it grew a faith that could help him stand against the adversities of life.&quot;<sup>[5]</sup></p>
<p>&quot;[Another] element of this group of psalms is the basis for trust. That is, sometimes the psalmist recounted a point of knowledge, a spiritual principle he had observed, or an experience that had taught him the lesson of faith.&quot;<sup>[6]</sup></p>
<h3 id="the-use-of-these-psalms-in-community">The use of these psalms in community</h3>
<p>Psalms 115, 121, 125, and 129 are corporate psalms, which were said together by the congregation in the temple. Some of the confidence psalms contain an invitation for those listening to trust in God:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Put your trust in the LORD&quot; (4:5)</li>
<li>&quot;Wait on the LORD: Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart&quot; (27:14)</li>
<li>&quot;Trust in him at all times; ye people&quot; (62:8)</li>
<li>&quot;O Israel, trust thou in the LORD&quot; (115:9)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="themes-found-in-these-psalms">Themes found in these psalms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sleep (3:5; 4:8; 23:2). We can sleep, because we know that God never sleeps (121:3–4).</li>
<li>Stability (16:8; 121:3; 125:1–2). This idea is also expressed by comparing God to a mountain (11:1), rock (62:2), and fortress (62:2). In ancient Israel, this included the idea that they would not be moved from their country.</li>
<li>Protection (16:1, 9b; 23:4; 27:3, 5–6). God has kept us, and He will continue to keep us.</li>
<li>Salvation (3:8; 27:1, 9; 62:7). The <em>salvation</em> mentioned in the psalms would not have meant a spiritual salvation, like we think of as New Testament Christians, but it would have meant physical deliverance from an enemy.</li>
<li>Trust (4:5; 62:8; 115:9, 11).</li>
<li>Joy (4:7; 16:11; 27:6).</li>
<li>Peace (4:8; 125:5).</li>

<p>They primarily do not make requests for God to be something or do something, but they make declarative statements about who God already is and what He already does.<sup>[7]</sup> In Psalm 23 David does not ask, &quot;Lord, be a shepherd to me!&quot; be he says, &quot;the Lord <strong>is</strong> my shepherd.&quot; In many of these psalms, there are statements about God in the third person instead of direct addresses to Him.<sup>[8]</sup> In these psalms God is depicted as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a shield (3:3; 115:10)</li>
<li>a refuge for us (62:8)</li>
<li>their help (115:10)</li>
<li>your keeper (121:5)</li>
<li>your shade (121:5)</li>
<li>my glory (3:3)</li>
<li>my chosen portion (16:5)</li>
<li>my cup (16:5)</li>
<li>my shepherd (23:1)</li>
<li>my light (27:1)</li>
<li>my salvation (27:1)</li>
<li>the lifter of my head (3:3)</li>
<li>the stronghold of my life (27:1)</li>

<p>Psalm 62 makes it clear that it is God alone that is our source of confidence. </p>

<h2 id="psalms-of-royalty">Psalms of royalty</h2>
<p>Psalms of royalty concern the reign of the king, either historical or messianic, or both. The psalms of royalty are 2, 18, 20, 21, 45, 72, 89, 101, 110, 132, and 144.</p>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-the-earthly-king">The importance of the earthly king</h3>
<p>A modern Christian may wonder why there are special psalms that talk about a government leader. But we must remember that for ancient Israel, the king was both a government and religious leader. &quot;The monarchy was, along with the priesthood and prophecy, one of Israel’s three fundamental institutions, and it takes a far more central place in the Psalms than either of the other two.&quot;<sup>[1]</sup> &quot;The king was a substantial figure in pre-exilic Jerusalem. He ruled as God’s representative on earth and spoke to the people in that role. At the same time, the king, because of his special relation with God, represented the people in addressing God. The king had a kind of intermediary role.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup> There is a special relationship between God and the king in these psalms. God calls the king His son in Psalm 2:6. The king confirms this relationship when he calls God his Father in Psalm 89:26–27.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
<p>David was a king, and he wrote almost half of the book. The kingship of David influenced the content of the book.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> Should we sing national anthems in church?</p>
<h3 id="the-events-in-the-psalms-of-royalty">The events in the psalms of royalty</h3>
<p>We are not certain exactly how these psalms were used in the worship rituals of ancient Israel, but we can tell from their content that some of them were for special events in the life of the king.</p>
<h4 id="the-coronation-of-the-king">The coronation of the king</h4>
<p>Psalm 2 celebrates the coronation of the king. It shows that some people rebelled against the new king (v. 1–3). God had appointed the king for that position, so God would judge those that opposed the king (v. 4–5). Psalms 110 and 132 show that the Davidic kingship is a position chosen by God.</p>
<h4 id="the-responsibilities-of-the-king">The responsibilities of the king</h4>
<p>Psalms 72 and 101 show the responsibilities of the king. &quot;As leader of the people, the monarch is to guarantee justice and righteousness.&quot;<sup>[4]</sup></p>
<h4 id="the-king-at-war">The king at war</h4>
<p>Psalm 20 is a prayer for the king to have victory in battle. In Psalms 89 and 144 the king himself is in the midst of battle, and he is asking God for help. Psalm 18 is a prayer of thanks after the king has won the battle.</p>
<h4 id="the-wedding-of-the-king">The wedding of the king</h4>
<p>Psalm 45 is about the wedding of the king.</p>
<h3 id="the-messiah-in-the-psalms-of-royalty">The Messiah in the psalms of royalty</h3>
<p>When the final version of the book of Psalms was compiled, it was after the Babylonian exile of the Israelites. This means that there was no king sitting on the throne in Israel. Then why did they keep these songs about the king in their songbook? It is likely that these texts came to be interpreted as a promise of the Messiah that would come to deliver and rule over Israel. The noun <em>Messiah</em> (which is translated &quot;anointed one&quot;) is used nine times in these eleven psalms, and the verb &quot;to anoint&quot; is used two times.<sup>[5]</sup> So we have two uses of these psalms: 1) a historical interpretation, where the <em>king</em> is the Israelite king, and 2) a prophetic interpretation, where the <em>king</em> is the Messiah, the Christ of the New Testament. So the primary reason that these psalms were included in the final version of the psalter was that they were a hope for the future.<sup>[6]</sup></p>
<p>The New Testament affirms that these psalms were prophetic of Jesus. &quot;The New Testament quoted from this group of psalms at least fifteen times, all of those quotations taken from Psalms 2 (6 times), 18, 45, and 110 (7 times).&quot;<sup>[7]</sup> &quot;Consequently, the New Testament draws upon these psalms to affirm Christ’s superiority: over angels, over David, and over the Aaronic priesthood. The writer to the Hebrews quotes Psalm 45:6–7 to attest to Christ’s superiority over angels (Heb 1:8–9). He also draws upon Psalms 2:7 and 110:1 for the same purpose (Heb 1:5 and 1:13 respectively).&quot;<sup>[8]</sup></p>

<h2 id="the-psalms-of-enthronement">The psalms of enthronement</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The <strong>psalms of enthronement</strong> contain the expression “the Lord reigns” (or, in the case of Psalm 98, “the Lord, the King”), and speak of the rule of God over all the earth. He is &quot;kingly&quot; to the greatest extant. A king reigns, has domimion and a good king is the joy of His people. These psalms are 47, 93, 95–99. The majority of these come after Psalm 89, which expresses discouragement about the ending of the kingship of Israel. These psalms show that even though the earthly kingdom may fail, the heavenly kingdom will never fail.</p>
<p>God is the king of Israel, but He is also king over the heathen (47:8) and over all the earth (47:2). He is above all other gods (97:7–9).</p>
<h3 id="the-lord-is-sovereign-in-righteousness-and-justice">The Lord is sovereign in righteousness and justice</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Where there is no injustice, there is little need to speak of justice. The frequency of the topic of justice in these psalms would therefore suggest that they were intended to deal with circumstances where injustice had become rife.<br>—C. Hassell Bullock<sup>[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psalm 97:2 says that, &quot;righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.&quot; His righteousness has been not only revealed to the Israelites, but it has also be shown to the heathen (98:2).</p>
<h3 id="the-lord-is-sovereign-in-creation">The Lord is sovereign in creation</h3>
<p>God made everything. He made the sea, land (95:5), and the heavens (96:5). He also created humans, so we must worship Him (95:6). He alone is Creator. All the other gods are just idols that have been created by man (96:5).</p>
<p>God has power over creation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The earth moves (99:1), </li>
<li>the earth trembles (97:4), </li>
<li>and the hills melt like wax (97:5) before the power of God. </li>
</ul>
<p>All of His creation praises Him:</p>
<ul>
<li>The heavens rejoice (96:11), </li>
<li>the earth is glad (96:11) and rejoices (97:1), </li>
<li>the field is joyful (96:12), </li>
<li>all the trees of the wood rejoice (96:12), </li>
<li>the multitude of isles are glad (97:1), </li>
<li>the heavens declare his righteousness (97:6), </li>
<li>the floods clap their hands (98:8), </li>
<li>and the hills are joyful (98:8) because of what God has done.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-lord-is-sovereign-in-judgment">The Lord is sovereign in judgment</h3>
<p>His judgment is righteous and based on the truth (96:10, 13), which means that it is good and fair judgment. He judges all people, not just the Israelites (96:13). The purpose of His judgment is to bring equity (99:4).</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> What is equity?</p>
<p>Psalm 47:2 says that God is <strong>terrible</strong>. (See also 45:4; 65:5; 66:3, 5; 68:35; 76:12; 99:3; 106:22.) What does it mean that God is terrible? &quot;The terror of the Lord&quot; speaks of the reverence or fear inspired by the thought that God is judge (2 Corinthians 5:10–11).</p>
<h3 id="the-lord-is-the-sovereign-king-of-the-future">The Lord is the sovereign king of the future</h3>
<p>There is a forward-looking aspect in 98:9. It is looking forward in time to when the kingdom of God will be fully manifested. God is king today, and He will always be king. No one will replace Him.</p>

<h2 id="psalms-of-wisdom">Psalms of wisdom</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>These psalms are not directed to God, but they are instruction for those listening. They share vocabulary and ideas with the wisdom books of Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes. The psalms of wisdom are 1, 14, 37, 49, 52, 53, 73, 75, 91, 112, 119, 127, 128, 133, and 139. Some consider 32, 34, 78, 90, 105, 106, and 111 to also be wisdom psalms.<sup>[1]</sup> Parts of other psalms have strong wisdom influence, such as 19:7–14, 94:8–15, and 97:10–12.<sup>[2]</sup> Some of the wisdom psalms are more like the instructions for life given in Proverbs (i.e. 1 and 112) and others are more like the questions about life that are asked in Job and Ecclesiastes (37, 49, and 73).<sup>[3]</sup> Psalms 119, 19B, and 1 are sometimes called <em>Torah Psalms</em> because of their emphasis on the law of God.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
<p>Psalms of wisdom emphasize the teaching of the wise men of Israel, meditation of the law, the way of the righteous versus the way of the wicked, and the necessity of practical righteousness. They frequently deal with topics such as the injustices of life and the justice of God, the responsibilities of choosing the correct path or manner of living, the relative value of riches, and the fact that man is only a pilgrim or traveler passing through this life. These psalms are similar to Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes in terms of literary structures, vocabulary, and themes. </p>
<h3 id="literary-structure-of-the-wisdom-psalms">Literary structure of the wisdom psalms</h3>
<p>Lament, acrostic structures, numerical sayings, and parallelism are all literary structures used in the psalms of wisdom and the other biblical books of poetry. Parallelism is a major characteristic of Hebrew poetry that can be understood as a balanced repetition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 37:2—For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,<br>and wither as the green herb.</p>
<p>Psalm 139:23—Search me, O God, and know my heart:<br>try me, and know my thoughts:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other literary characteristics that these psalms share with wisdom literature are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The better saying</strong>: &quot;A little that a righteous man hath Is better than the riches of many wicked.&quot; (37:16)</li>
<li><strong>The blessed/happy saying</strong>: &quot;Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; That walketh in his ways.&quot; (128:1)</li>
<li><strong>The warning</strong>: &quot;Be ye not as the horse, Or as the mule, which have no understanding: Whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, Lest they come near unto thee.&quot; (32:9)</li>
<li><strong>The address</strong>: &quot;Hear this, all ye people; Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world: Both low and high, Rich and poor, together.&quot; (49:1–2)</li>
<li>Other forms characteristic of wisdom such as <strong>the simile</strong> (1:4), <strong>numerical saying</strong> (62:11&ndash;12), or <strong>rhetorical question</strong> (14:4).<sup>[5]</sup></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="themes-in-wisdom-psalms">Themes in wisdom psalms</h3>
<p>Common vocabulary in these psalms express lament, thanksgiving, and praise. Also, there are words related to wisdom, justice, truth, mercy, and creation theology. There are concepts in common with other wisdom literature:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fear of Yahweh and the love of &quot;torah&quot; (119)</li>
<li>The contrast between righteous and wicked (1, 49, 73, 112, and 127)</li>
<li>Instruction in daily living (133 and 112)</li>
<li>The importance of wisdom (90:12 and 39:4. Compare to Proverbs 4:7 and Job 28:28)</li>
<li>The concept that wisdom is a walk (139:24 and 143:10. Compare to Proverbs 28:26)</li>
<li>The question of why a just God allows the innocent to suffer (49:16&ndash;19. Compare the book of Job.)</li>
<li>The theology of creation (33:6 and 19:1–2. Compare Job 38:1, 4, Proverbs 8:22, and Ecclesiastes 12:1)</li>

<h2 id="psalms-of-zion">Psalms of Zion</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Psalms of Zion extol Zion, or Jerusalem, for its exalted role as the abode of God’s glory and as the religious and political capital of the nation. They are 15, 24, 46, 48, 50, 76, 81, 84, 87, and 122.</p>
<h3 id="zion">Zion</h3>
<h4 id="the-city-of-david">The city of David</h4>
<p>David took the stronghold of Zion which was the easternmost of the two hills of ancient Jerusalem (2 Samuel 5:6–10). David had pitched a tent for the Ark of the Covenant in 1 Chronicles 15. When Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem, the meaning of Zion expanded further to include the temple area (1 Kings 8:1). In the Old Testament, Zion is used as a name for the city of Jerusalem (Isaiah 40:9), the land of Judah (Jeremiah 31:12), and the nation of Israel as a whole (Zechariah 9:13).</p>
<h4 id="the-city-of-god">The city of God</h4>
<p>The word <em>Zion</em> occurs over 150 times in the Bible. The word Zion is also used in a spiritual sense in Scripture. In the New Testament, Zion refers to God’s spiritual kingdom. We have not come to Mount Sinai, says the apostle, but &quot;mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem&quot; (Hebrews 12:22). Just as King David was a temporal version of the eternal King, Jesus Christ, the &quot;city of David&quot; was a temporal shadow of the eternal and spiritual city, Zion, where Christ will reign.</p>
<h3 id="pilgrim-psalms">Pilgrim Psalms</h3>
<p>The Pilgrim Psalms are sometimes included with the Psalms of Zion as they do not really constitute a distinct literary type of their own. Pilgrim Psalms or Song of Ascents is a title given to fifteen of the Psalms (120–134) each starting with the ascription <strong>Shir Hama&#39;aloth</strong> (literally meaning &quot;to go up to&quot;). They are also called Gradual Psalms, Songs of Degrees, or Songs of Steps.</p>
<p>Four of these psalms (122, 124, 131 and 133) are linked in their ascriptions to David, and one to Solomon (127). Psalms of Ascents were sung by pilgrims journeying up to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.</p>
<!--## Why Pray for Peace?

- Psalm 122 A Song of degrees of David.

> Psalm 122 &mdash; 1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. 2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. 5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. 7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 9 Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.

- Glad: to go into "the house of the Lord"
- A city that is "compact together": "united together"
- v.6 "...: they shall prosper that love thee." (also translated "may those who love you prosper")

    - Psalm 29:11 It is God who causes to prosper: strength and peace (Psalm 118:25)
    - Psalm 102:14 God's Servants Care About the Prosperity of Jerusalem (stones and dust)
    - Isaiah 66:10 A Command to Love Jersusalem
    - Jeremiah 29:7 Those Who Love Jerusalem were to Seek the Prosperity of the City in which they were exiled-->

<h1 id="proverbs">Proverbs</h1>
<h2 id="introduction-to-the-book-of-proverbs">Introduction to the Book of Proverbs</h2>
<h3 id="proverbs-is-not-just-a-random-collection-of-sayings">Proverbs is not just a random collection of sayings</h3>
<p>Proverbs has two major sections (1-9 &amp; 10-31), that compose seven different collections (1:1; 10:1; 22:17; 24:23; 25:1; 30:1; 31:1). The first nine chapters are longer poems that deal with subjects in depth, and the rest of the book is composed of individual sentence sayings.</p>
<!--
#### What is a proverb?

A proverb uses as few words as possible to communicate truth.

As Cervantes, the 16th century novelist, put it, “Proverbs are short sentences, drawn from long experience.” from _Living Well_)

Written by Solomon (1:1)

Tremper Longman divides this section into 17 lectures. See How to Read Proverbs pg. 
22 for list. Waltke gives only 14 (NICOT pg. 10)

Collection I: Title with Preamble (1:1–7), Prologue (1:1–8:36), and Epilogue (9:1–18) (NICOT)

Ch 10-31 individual proverbs

How many sayings?

#### Kinds of sayings

> Specifically, the following types of sayings are listed: maxims, proverbs, difficult sayings, words of the wise and enigmas. (How to read Proverbs, pg. 17)

> In spite of the quibbles over the exact meaning of these words, they all clearly represent Hebrew words that are difficult to understand not because they have a secret meaning or a code, but because they are forms of writing that address their subject indirectly rather than spelling it out in cold, factual language. (How to Read, pg. 17)-->
<h3 id="proverbs-is-of-the-wisdom-genre">Proverbs is of the wisdom genre</h3>
<p>Not every passage in the Bible is read the same. For example we read Acts 17:1 differently than we read Psalm 18:8. The first is an historical account of events, and the second is poetic and symbolic description of God. God does not literally have smoke coming out of His nose (He does not actually have a nose, either, since He is a spirit). The same way, we do not read Proverbs the same way we would Leviticus or one of the prophets.</p>
<p>Before we talk about what makes a proverb unique, let&#39;s look at two verses from Proverbs that confuse some people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 26:4—Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</p>
<p>Proverbs 26:5—Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why are these two Proverbs contradicting each other?</p>
<h4 id="proverbs-are-different-than-laws">Proverbs are different than laws</h4>
<p>A law is always the same. It does not change based on circumstances. Proverbs are different from laws because at some times they are good to follow, but at other times it is not wise to obey it. We need wisdom to know when to obey a Proverb. </p>
<h4 id="proverbs-are-different-than-promises">Proverbs are different than promises</h4>
<p>Proverbs 22:6 says that if you teach your children the right way, then they will never leave that way. But what does it mean if my children leave church? Why do some virtuous women have abusive husbands or disrespectful children? (Prov. 31:28)</p>
<p>Proverbs is part of the biblical canon and also part of a collection of wisdom books. Reading the other wisdom books can give us insight about the application of Proverbs to life.</p>
<p>In the book of Job, which is another wisdom book, Job&#39;s friends believe in a <em>retribution theology</em>, which means they believed that bad things only happen to bad people, and good things only happen to good people. Since Job&#39;s life was full of bad things, they thought that he must be a really bad sinner. But we know from the story in chapters 1 and 2, that these events in Job&#39;s life were not because of sin.</p>
<p>The preacher in Ecclesiastes 1:12–17 and the writer of Psalm 73 lament because the foolish and wicked seem to live good lives.</p>
<p>If proverbs are not laws or promises, than what are they?</p>
<!--The second chapter of _Interpreting Wisdom_ has good thoughts on character-consequence nexus.-->
<h4 id="proverbs-are-principles">Proverbs are principles</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Promises are always fulfilled 100 percent of the time. Principles state general truths.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We still obey these principles, even though we may not see the exact results that we hope for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On what grounds, then, could the sages so confidently assert the superiority of righteousness even though they were aware of righteous folk who suffered and of wicked folk who prospered? <em>In general</em>, the sages clearly believed that wise and righteous behavior did make life better and richer, though virtue did not <em>guarantee</em> those consequences.
—Raymond C. Van Leeuwan<sup>[2]</sup></p>
<p>It is a mistake, though, to treat the proverb as a type of guarantee. That is not what proverbs do. Again, it is a genre issue. Proverbs are not in the business of giving promises. Rather, they encourage people toward attitudes and actions that will lead toward a desired goal, all other things being equal. It is more likely that a child will grow up to be wise if their parents train them in the Lord’s way. But perhaps that child will come under the negative influence of his or her peers (see, for instance, the advice given in 1:8-19).
—Tremper Longman, III</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Job&#39;s friends and the preacher of Ecclesiastes may have had a wrong understanding of applying principles like these, but that does not make the principles wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The widespread dogmatic misuse of retributive sayings or concepts (Job 42:7; Luke 13:1-5; John 9:1-2; cf. Prov 26:7, 9) does not itself render the sayings dogmatic.
—Raymond C. Van Leeuwan<sup>[3]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="a-proverb-needs-wisdom-for-proper-application">A proverb needs wisdom for proper application</h5>
<h6 id="wisdom-for-the-right-time">Wisdom for the right time</h6>
<p>Ecclesiates teaches that there is a time for everything (Ecc. 3:1-8). Read Proverbs 15:23, 25:11, and 25:20.</p>
<h6 id="wisdom-for-right-circumstances">Wisdom for right circumstances</h6>
<!--It is not only biblical proverbs that are based on circumstances, but contemporary English sayings are also situational:

* ‘Many hands make light work’ versus ‘Too many cooks spoil the 
broth’ 
* ‘He who hesitates is lost’ versus ‘Look before you leap’ 
* ‘Out of sight, out of mind’ versus ‘Absence makes the heart 
grow fonder’-->
<p>The contrasting ideas found in Proverbs are not contradictions, but they provide a balanced understanding of wisdom that applies to the varieties of life situations.</p>
<p>Proverbs 18:22 says that he that &quot;findeth a wife findeth a good thing,&quot; but 21:9 says that &quot;It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, Than with a brawling woman in a wide house.&quot; So marriage is good... but only if you marry the right person.</p>
<p>A proverb used wrongly can be dangerous. Proverbs 27:5 says that &quot;Open rebuke is better than secret love,&quot; but that does not mean that we should rebuke every person every time we think they are doing something wrong. Read Proverbs 26:7 and 26:9.</p>
<p>No single verse of Scripture gives us a complete view on any one subject. Compare one proverb with other proverbs and other Scriptures to get a better understanding of it.</p>
<p>We have to read Proverbs with an understanding that there are things in life that are complicated. From the proverbs we see that &quot;The blessing of the LORD makes rich&quot; (10:22) and also that &quot;Violent men get riches&quot; (11:16).</p>
<h5 id="just-because-a-proverb-says-something-is-better-than-something-else-does-not-mean-that-the-thing-compared-is-inherently-bad">Just because a proverb says something is better than something else, does not mean that the thing compared is inherently bad</h5>
<p>God will at times bless people with riches, but there are other blessings that He gives that are better than riches. Read Proverbs 16:8 and 16:16.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These &quot;better-than&quot; sayings set material wealth and poverty in an ultimate normative context which utterly reverses their usual worth. In a nutshell, poverty with righteousness is &quot;better than&quot; wealth with wickedness. Proverbs consistently insists that righteousness outweighs wealth, and wickedness renders wealth worthless. Wealth which may <em>appear</em> as a blessing of the Creator is not intrinsically and invariably good. That depends upon whether wealth is subordinate to righteousness, justice, and wisdom. Material goods must be placed in a normative context which relates them one to another and prevents any particular good from becoming absolute at the expense of the norms which order and limit them all.<br>—Raymond C. Van Leeuwan<sup>[4]</sup></p>
<p>The editor-sages who structured Proverbs sought first to teach these basic &quot;rules of life,&quot; thus the heavy emphasis on character-consequence patterns in both Proverbs 1–9 and 10–15. We must first learn the basic rules; the exceptions can come later.<br>—Raymond C. Van Leeuwan<sup>[5]</sup></p>

<li>People get rich by lying (21:6)</li>
<li>People ignore those that are in need (28:8; 21:13)</li>
</ul>
<p>The source of this injustice is because we live in a fallen world (unlike the plan God had in Eden). There may be injustice now, but God will judge in the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 10:30—The righteous shall never be removed:<br>But the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See also 10:2; 11:4, 7, 18, 21, 23, 28;  12:7, 12; 15:25; 17:5; 19:17; 20:21; 21:6–7, 13; 22:8–9, 16; 24:20; 28:8, 10, 20, 22, 27.</p>
<p>We do not always see the fulfillment of judgment in this life, and so we must use faith, or &quot;trust in the LORD with all [our] heart[s]&quot; (3:5–6). This leads us to discus the spiritual nature of the book.</p>
<h3 id="proverbs-is-a-spiritual-book">Proverbs is a spiritual book</h3>
<p>It is true that Proverbs deals with a lot of practical things in life, but true wisdom is more than just knowledge or emotional intelligence. To Solomon, wisdom does not begin with a natural education, but it comes from God. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge (1:7). Solomon himself got his wisdom by asking God (1 Kings 3:5–12).</p>
<p>A constant reason for behaving righteously is because God hates wickedness and loves righteousness (11:1; 12:2; 15:8–9; 17:15; 20:10, 23; 21:3, 27; 28:9).</p>
<h3 id="proverbs-is-written-in-a-poetic-form">Proverbs is written in a poetic form</h3>
<h4 id="parallelism">Parallelism</h4>
<p>The central characteristic of Hebrew poetry is parallelism, which is like a rhyming of ideas.</p>
<h5 id="synonymous-parallelism">Synonymous parallelism</h5>
<p>This is when the second line repeats the idea in the first using slightly different language. It is for narrowing the thought or making it sharper. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 18:15—The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge;<br>And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="antithetical-parallelism">Antithetical parallelism</h5>
<p>The second line contrasts the first, as in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 13:2—A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth:<br>But the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of sayings in chapters 10-15 are like this.</p>
<h5 id="synthetic-parallelism-sometimes-called-step-parallelism-">Synthetic parallelism (sometimes called step parallelism)</h5>
<p>The second line continues the thought of the first line by addition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 14:7—Go from the presence of a foolish man,<br>When thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="analogies">Analogies</h4>
<p>Proverbs uses a lot of symbolism or examples from natural life to illustrate and explain truth. Some of these are similes, which is a comparison of two things using <em>like</em> or <em>as</em>, as in the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 16:24—Pleasant words are as an honeycomb,<br>Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two in-depth uses of symbolism used throughout the first nine chapters that depict both wisdom and folly.</p>
<h5 id="woman-wisdom">Woman Wisdom</h5>
<p>She speaks in Proverbs 1:20-33 and chapter 8. She is also mentioned in 9:1-6, 11; 2:3-4; 4:7-9; 6:22; 7:4.</p>

<h5 id="woman-folly">Woman Folly</h5>
<p>She is mentioned in chapter 9:13-18. She is similar to the Strange Woman (5:8 and 7:22 are like 9:13-18. And 2:18-19, 5:5, and 7:27 are like 9:18). Both women start by calling out to the simple (9:4, 16). Both desire a relationship (come in with me). Both have prepared a meal (9:1-2, 17).</p>

<p>Writings of advice from a father to a son were common in the ancient near east.</p>
<p>A surface reading the Proverbs and all its warnings about the &quot;strange&quot; women can give the impression that only women have issues with promiscuity, but when we remember that it was written to a young man then it makes sense of why the warnings are against people of the opposite gender. We could safely assume that if it was written by a mother to her daughter that there would be plenty of warnings of the &quot;strange&quot; man.</p>

!! Add these quotes by William P. Brown from the foreward to Proverbs and the Formation of Character:

> As a compact, portable distillation of wisdom, the proverb makes no claim to universal truth or even authoritative guidance, yet it has the uncanny ability to tease the mind and heart, provoking new levels of discernment.

> That the book of Proverbs features an array of frequently contradictory sayings indicates how the sages dealt with the challenges of day-to-day living. Life, the ancients affirmed, is filled with competing allegiances and bewilderingly diverse situations that demand careful reflection and hard decisions.

> The editors behind Proverbs were quite explicit in the way they showcased these sayings. Their introduction to the book concludes with a profile of wisdom’s domicile, in which a lavish banquet is prepared for her would-be disciples (9:1–6). What does wisdom require but to leave immaturity at the front door and partake of her feast? “Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed,” she beckons (v. 5). Her guests include both the neophyte and the wise. And what does wisdom offer her guests at the table but a banquet of insight and a feast of fellowship? As hostess, wisdom serves a multi-course meal, a curricular cuisine of sayings and instructions. It is precisely her rich fare that is featured in the following chapters. To be savored, enjoyed, and digested, these proverbs are the edifying morsels that sustain moral living. More than simply food for thought, they provide the sustenance for righteousness.

Bland on the sentence literature:

> In short, the truly wise one is the person who lives life focused not on self but on seeking God (Prov. 3:5–7). This quest naturally generates character, certain wisdom virtues like prudence, self-control, righteousness, and justice (1:3).20 In turn, these virtues orient and order life in community. They enable us to manifest right behavior toward others. While these principles are introduced in the first nine chapters of Proverbs, it is only later in the sentence literature of chapters 10–29 that the sages will attempt to flesh out these virtues into concrete behavior. The sentence literature is the sages’ attempt to put righteousness in working clothes.21 This is what wisdom offers moral education.
> Proverbs and the Fromation of Character

-->
<h2 id="what-proverbs-says-about-character">What Proverbs says about character</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Wisdom will produce good character in us. Dave Bland, author of <em>Proverbs and the Formation of Character</em>, said that &quot;Wisdom is not content to leave us as we are but insists that we allow ourselves to be transformed by the power of God.&quot; The goal of the wisdom books are to change who we are. We cannot expect this character to happen in isolation, but good character is produced in community. Bland also says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Character, that cluster of virtues that forms into habits, is a product of one’s relationship with God and with other fellow humans. In as much as this character is the natural outgrowth of wisdom, it is important to realize that wisdom, as expressed in Proverbs, is relational. In coming into relationship with God and becoming involved in the lives of others, character takes shape. Character, being shaped by these relationships, in turn rejuvenates them, continually refreshing our love for God and for others.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good character is a valuable thing. Proverbs 22:1 says that it is better to choose good character than riches (see also 16:17, 19:1, 20:7, 20:11, 21:29, and 28:6). The value of good character is revealed in how it can keep us safe from the dangers of life. Proverbs 10:9 says that &quot;He that walketh uprightly walketh surely&quot; (see also 11:3 and 28:18). We will now look at some traits of good character.</p>
<h3 id="righteousness">Righteousness</h3>
<p>The book of Proverbs is not just a list of natural and moralistic rules, but these rules were founded on religion and a belief in God. The whole of Israel&#39;s society and government was permeated by a belief in God. Because of this, righteousness is an important characteristic in the book of Proverbs. Read Proverbs 10:6–7.</p>
<h3 id="steadfastness-perseverance">Steadfastness/Perseverance</h3>
<p>Things that will make us steadfast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wisdom (4:6; 24:3)</li>
<li>Prudence (4:25–27)</li>
<li>Righteousness (10:25; 12:3)</li>
<li>Trust in God (16:3)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="diligence">Diligence</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 21:5—The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness;<br>But of every one that is hasty only to want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See also 11:27, 12:24, 12:27, 13:4.</p>
<h3 id="humility">Humility</h3>
<p>God hates pride. Proverbs chapter 6 lists seven things that God hates. The first item in this list is pride (6:16–17a; See also 21:4). Because God hates pride He will punish the proud (15:25; 16:5) and we should share His hatred for it (8:12–13).</p>
<p>What does it mean to be humble? A humble person does not brag about himself (27:2; 25:27). When we are humble, we show that we trust in God (28:26). Humility brings blessings (22:4) and honor (15:33), while pride brings shame (11:2), contention (13:10; 21:24), and self-destruction (16:18; 18:12; 29:23).</p>
<h3 id="contentment">Contentment</h3>
<p>There can be too much of a good thing. Contentment keeps us from overindulgence (25:16). Contentment values spiritual things more than physical things (15:16–17). It is easy to be envious of wicked people that have more than us, but we need to remember that money cannot profit in eternity (23:17–18; 24:1–2; 24:19–20). We need to learn to be content, because envy is never satisfied (30:15–16). This envy will destroy us if we do not stop it (14:30).</p>
<h3 id="patience">Patience</h3>
<p>Patience is a powerful characteristic. Proverbs 16:32 says that &quot;He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty.&quot; The fool gets angry quickly, but the wise man is patient (14:29; 29:20). A patient person can make peace, but if we are angry, we will make other people angry (15:18; 19:11).</p>
<p>Patience in our work will bring results. Many people want get to get rich quickly, but diligent work has a better guarantee for prosperity (28:20; 13:11; 20:21; 21:5).</p>
<p>Patience keeps you from sinning (19:2), it shows trust in God (20:22), and it can change other people&#39;s opinions (25:15).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In ancient Israeli culture, people were motivated by honor and shame. The shame of one person could shame their whole family. Proverbs says that the foolish son shames on his parents (10:5) and the foolish wife shames her husband (11:16; 12:4). A person of good character will have honor (21:21), but the person of bad character will have shame (13:5; 18:3).</p>

<h2 id="what-proverbs-says-about-the-power-of-words">What Proverbs says about the power of words</h2>
<h3 id="death-and-life-are-in-the-power-of-the-tongue">Death and life are in the power of the tongue</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 18:21—Death and life are in the power of the tongue:<br>And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some preachers will tell you that this scripture reveals that there is a supernatural force behind our words, and that with our words we can speak things into existence. They say that if you claim good things and say, &quot;I will have a new car,&quot; then God will give you a new car. They also say that if you let negative words escape your mouth, such as, &quot;I am feeling sick today,&quot; then you will experience the things you said.</p>
<p>Can our words change the world in which we live? The answer is both &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no.&quot; This verse is not saying that our words have magical or supernatural power. There are other passages in the Bible that mention spiritual forces working behind the words of humans, but this is talking about a very human and natural way that our words can affect our lives. It is this: our words have consequences.</p>
<p>The primary way that one human lets another human know what he is thinking is through words. They may be spoken, recorded with an electronic device, or written down, but they are still words. You cannot read another person&#39;s mind, and body language is not consistent in its interpretation. This means that whatever is in our head (good or bad), is only known if we open our mouths. If we say things that are helpful or encouraging to someone, then we could expect them to feel happy and want to be our friend. If we say things to hurt people or to say things that will make them feel sad or angry, then we should expect them to react negatively to what we said. They may return hurtful words to us, start crying, or throw a punch. If they are our boss, then we may get reprimanded or fired. In Matthew 12:36–37 Jesus says that our words can also affect us in the life to come. He said that on the judgment day we will have to &quot;give account&quot; of all of our words, and depending on what they were, we will either be condemned or justified.</p>
<p>The tongue is a powerful tool (or weapon, depending on how it is used). James says it is like the helm of a ship, because even though it is small, the tongue can alter the course of our lives (James 3:3–5). The book of Proverbs gives many examples of the consequences to the things we say.</p>
<!-- The tongue stands in the middle ready for either use; you are its master. So also does a sword lie in the middle; if you use it against the enemy, it becomes an instrument for your safety; if you use it to wound yourself, it is not the steel but your own transgression of the law that causes your death. Let us think of the tongue in the same way, as a sword lying in the middle. Sharpen it to accuse yourself of your own sins, but do not use it to wound your brother.
> Hence, God has surrounded the tongue with a double wall—with the barrier of the teeth and the fence of the lips—in order that it may not easily and heedlessly utter words it should not speak. BAPTISMAL INSTRUCTIONS 9.33–35.

<h3 id="some-positive-consequences-of-words">Some positive consequences of words</h3>
<h4 id="we-can-benefit-from-our-own-good-words">We can benefit from our own good words</h4>
<p>Proverbs 18:20, which immediately precedes the verse about life and death being in the power of the tongue, talks about the positive results that come from speaking wisely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 18:20—A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;<br>And with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our words are like seeds, and if they are healthy seeds, then they will produce fruit. In his commentary on Proverbs, Lindsay Wilson says that &quot;the idea of the first line is that those who speak well (e.g. carefully, truthfully, compellingly) can gain success and earn a living (e.g. by making a deal, motivating others, resolving problems). Their lips or speech produce a useful outcome which enables them to meet their needs.&quot;<sup>[1]</sup> Tremper Longman III takes a slightly different approach and says that &quot;just as food satisfies one’s physical hunger, so also words satisfy one’s intellectual and spiritual hunger.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup> Both interpretations fit because they show the positive results of our words. See also 12:14 and 13:2.</p>
<!-- Moffatt paraphrases 20 well, but one-sidedly: ‘A man must answer for his utterances, and take the consequences of his words.’
> Kidner, D. (1964). Proverbs: An Introduction and Commentary (Vol. 17, p. 123). Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press.-->
<p>There are times when we find ourselves in difficult situations, but if we use wise words, they will deliver us out of the trouble (12:6).</p>
<h4 id="other-people-can-benefit-from-our-good-words">Other people can benefit from our good words</h4>
<p>Our words do not only affect us, but they can help our hinder those who hear us. If we speak wisely, then we can help other people. Everyone faces discouragement at some time, and our words can add to that discouragement or they can encourage the person. A person may have &quot;heaviness&quot; in their heart, but a good word can lift their spirits and make the heart glad (12:25). Wisdom can help you say the right word at the right time to help someone (15:23; 25:11–12). Proverbs uses many different illustrations that show how our words can be beneficial to others:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life (10:11)</li>
<li>The tongue of the just is as choice silver (10:20)</li>
<li>The lips of knowledge are a precious jewel (20:15)</li>
<li>The lips of the righteous feed many (10:21)</li>
<li>The tongue of the wise is health (12:18)</li>
<li>Pleasant words are as an honeycomb (16:24)</li>
<li>A wholesome tongue is a tree of life (15:4)</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to ask ourselves if our words are matching up with the examples on this list. Are the things that I say random and useless or are they as valuable as silver? When I speak are people fed? Are my words sweet like a honeycomb or are they bitter?</p>
<h3 id="some-negative-consequences-of-words">Some negative consequences of words</h3>
<h4 id="our-words-can-hurt-ourselves">Our words can hurt ourselves</h4>
<p>Many times we blame others for our troubles, but it is very possible that our problems are a consequence of foolish or unrighteous words (6:12–15; 12:13; <strong>18:7</strong>). These words can trap us as people use the things that we have said against us. This snare is not always because of wicked words. For example, how many of us have felt trapped because we made an unwise promise that we couldn&#39;t keep? If we do not carefully guard our mouth, it will put us in positions where people will want to verbally and perhaps even physically fight with us (10:14; 17:20; <strong>18:6</strong>).</p>

      3       In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride:
      But the lips of the wise shall preserve them.
-->
<h4 id="our-words-can-hurt-others">Our words can hurt others</h4>
<p>Just as good words can help other people, bad words can hurt them. The saying &quot;sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me&quot; is not true. Proverbs says that our words can be like &quot;the piercings of a sword&quot; (12:18), and with it we can destroy our neighbor (11:9) or even a whole city (11:11). It may seem like an exaggeration that mere words could destroy a city, but looking at history would remind us of how many tyrants were able to destroy not only cities, but whole countries through their speeches and propaganda. </p>
<p>Proverbs 16:27 says that in there is a burning fire in the lips of the ungodly man. James adds that the flame of the tongue sets &quot;on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell&quot; (James 3:6). Like fire, gossip and lies spread very quickly.</p>
<h3 id="some-advice-on-using-words-profitably">Some advice on using words profitably</h3>
<h4 id="don-t-be-quick-to-answer">Don&#39;t be quick to answer</h4>
<p>We need to think before we talk. Knee-jerk reactions are hardly ever profitable (15:28). There is a saying that says, &quot;God gave you two ears and only one mouth, so you should do twice as much listening as you do talking.&quot; That is not scripture, but it is a scriptural principle that we need to listen. We should not give our opinion about something before we have a good understanding of it (18:13). We also need to be careful that we are not listening to foolish people, liars, or talebearers (14:7; 17:4; 20:19).</p>
<p>Proverbs 18:13 says that we need to be careful to listen to someone tell us about a problem before we answer. In court, the judge listens to both sides of a problem before he makes a decision. See also 16:20, 21:23, and 29:20.</p>
<h4 id="talking-too-much-is-not-good">Talking too much is not good</h4>
<p>Being a man of few words is a sign of wisdom (17:27), and even a fool can seem like a wise man if he doesn&#39;t speak much (17:28)! The reason that the wise man doesn&#39;t speak much is because he is trying to avoid sinning with his words. The person who talks a lot is guaranteed to say something foolish or sinful because they don&#39;t take the time to think before they speak (10:19; 10:8; 10:10; 13:3).</p>
<h4 id="against-slander-and-gossip">Against slander and gossip</h4>
<p>Proverbs teaches us that gossip can hurt people (18:8; 26:22). The Jewish Midrash says “The evil tongue slays three, the slanderer, the slandered, and the listener” (Midrash Tehillim 52:2). A little whispering can separate even the closest of friendships (16:28). It should be our desire to unite people, and not to divide them. Our words often put negative thoughts in the heads of others.</p>
<h5 id="sometimes-it-is-best-not-to-talk-about-someone-s-sin">Sometimes it is best not to talk about someone&#39;s sin</h5>
<p>If we know about someone&#39;s sin we should not tell everyone about it (17:9; 10:12). Many times we use prayer requests as an opportunity to share about other peoples mistakes and sins. When you choose not to talk about what someone has done, then, by default, you have chosen to cover it. We should not lie to protect someone, and if there is someone else that is in danger because of the person&#39;s sin, then we should speak up about it. See also 10:18, and 11:12, and 25:23.</p>
<h4 id="flattery-is-deceiving">Flattery is deceiving</h4>
<p>When people aren&#39;t around, we will often say bad things about them, but when we see them, we only tell them good things about themselves. Our modern culture strongly values affirmation. It says &quot;everyone is a winner,&quot; &quot;You are beautiful just the way you are,&quot; and &quot;you are a strong and powerful person.&quot; We care about &quot;likes&quot; on social media. Encouragement is a good thing, but we need to be careful that we are giving encouragement that is true and helpful. If we tell someone that they are a good cook, but then don&#39;t like to eat their food, then we are lying. We say that we don&#39;t want to hurt their feelings, but they will not grow without constructive criticism. We need to speak the truth gently and in love (Ephesians 4:15). They may feel hurt at the moment, but later they might appreciate it (28:23).</p>
<p>Proverbs warns that a flattering mouth ruins things (<strong>26:28</strong>). When we flatter someone, we set them up for a fall (29:5). We think we are being nice, but really we are hurting them. Jesus warned us that it is not good when everyone speaks well of us, because many people have spoken good things about false prophets (Luke 6:26). We should be more concerned with our lives aligning with the Bible then with pleasing people so that they will like us.</p>
<h4 id="honesty-is-the-best-policy">Honesty is the best policy</h4>
<p>It may seem like an obvious thing that we should always tell the truth, but Proverbs repeats the idea many times so that we will remember (<strong>12:19</strong>; 12:22; 14:5; 14:25; 19:5; 19:9; <strong>21:6</strong>; 24:28–29; 25:18). Truth is loved by both God (12:22) and man (24:26).</p>
<h4 id="it-is-not-only-what-we-say-but-how-we-say-it-that-matters">It is not only what we say, but how we say it that matters</h4>
<p>You can say the right words, but if you can say them in a mean or angry manner, then you may still get negative results. If you approach someone loud and angrily, then it is likely that they will also raise their voices and be angry, but if we approach them quietly and meekly, they are more likely to remain calm (15:1). Soft words are also powerful because they  can break down hard-set opposition (25:15). See also 16:21.</p>
<h4 id="don-t-argue-with-fools">Don&#39;t argue with fools</h4>
<p>Proverbs 23:9 tells us that we should not try speaking to a foolish person, because they will despise what you say. Paul told both Titus (Titus 3:9) and Timothy (II Timothy 2:23) to avoid pointless conversations because they will only produce strife. Even with these warnings, sometimes it is wise to try to persuade a foolish person (26:4–5).</p>

<h2 id="what-proverbs-says-about-friendships">What Proverbs says about friendships</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-it-is-wise-to-have-friends">Introduction: It is wise to have friends</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 18:1—Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh<br>And intermeddleth with all wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hebrew word for <em>intermeddleth</em> in the Hebrew is <em>gala</em> (גָּלַע ), which means &quot;to be hostile or to defy.&quot;<sup>[1]</sup> This means that the selfish man, who is seeking his own desires, is defying wisdom. Wisdom says that it is a good thing to have friends, but he is too selfish to share his time and resources with other people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No man is an island entire of itself; every man<br>is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;<br>if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe<br>is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as<br>well as any manner of thy friends or of thine<br>own were; any man&#39;s death diminishes me,<br>because I am involved in mankind.<br>And therefore never send to know for whom<br>the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.<br>—<em>John Donne</em><sup>[2]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God said it is not good for man to be alone (Gen. 2:18).</p>
<h3 id="it-is-better-to-have-a-few-real-friends-than-to-have-many-shallow-friends">It is better to have a few real friends than to have many shallow friends</h3>
<p>Not everyone that says that they are your friend is a real friend. In Proverbs the Hebrew word <em>rea</em> (רֵעַ ) can mean either a &quot;neighbor&quot; or a &quot;friend.&quot;<sup>[3]</sup> We have to look at the context to see if the word means someone who is physically close (a neighbor) or someone who is emotionally close (a friend). In life we also have to discern who are real friends are. You can live near someone and see them every day, but that does not make them a true friend. Many people talk good to us. They say, &quot;I am your friend,&quot; but will they be there when you really need them? A true friend is someone who is there in the good times and the bad times.</p>

<h4 id="a-true-friend-never-abandons-you">A true friend never abandons you</h4>
<p>Proverbs 17:17 says that &quot;A friend loveth at all times, And a brother is born for adversity.&quot; There are two ways of interpreting this verse:</p>
<ol>
<li>One way says that the friend is better than the brother. Bruce Waltke says that in this verse that &quot;The friend is represented as always present, in good times and bad; the relative only in adversity.&quot;<sup>[4]</sup></li>
<li>The other way is that the two lines show how both the friend and the brother show their love. Tremper Longman, III says &quot;The relationship between the cola seems to be one of intensifying and particularizing, but not contrasting. That a friend loves all the time would include moments of adversity.&quot;<sup>[5]</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Either way of interpreting it, the verse talks about how a friend is always there—no matter what.</p>
<p>Talk is cheap. Proverbs 20:6 says that &quot;Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: But a faithful man who can find?&quot; We need to be careful that we do not put our trust in unfaithful men, because if we do, we will be in trouble. Read 25:19.</p>
<h4 id="some-people-will-want-to-be-your-friend-for-the-wrong-reason">Some people will want to be your friend for the wrong reason</h4>
<p>Some people call everyone their &quot;friend,&quot; but do they really care about you? (Or do you even care about them?) A friend is more than someone that can give <strong>you</strong> good things, but you have to also <strong>give to them</strong> to make strong friendships. When someone has money, then he will have many &quot;friends,&quot; but when the money is gone, the friends will also be gone (14:20; 19:4, 6–7).</p>

<h4 id="friends-may-be-closer-than-family">Friends may be closer than family</h4>
<p>Proverbs 18:24 says that &quot;there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother&quot; and 27:10 warns us not to forsake the old friends of the family because a neighbor that is near is better than a brother that is far away. Does this mean that family is not important? No. Lindsay Wilson says about this verse that &quot;This is not to minimize fraternal responsibilities, but rather to lift up the value of a friend or neighbour.&quot;<sup>[6]</sup></p>
<h4 id="choose-your-friends-wisely-because-they-can-influence-you">Choose your friends wisely because they can influence you</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 13:20—He that walketh with wise men shall be wise:<br>But a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book of Proverbs was written as a father to his son, so there are many warnings to stay away from negative influences (1:10–19; 12:26; 13:20; 16:29; 20:19; 22:24–25; 28:7; 29:3). Because bad relationships can be harmful to us, if we cannot find good friends, than it is better to be alone than to settle for bad friends—or a bad spouse! (17:1; 25:24)</p>
<h3 id="wisdom-teaches-us-how-to-be-a-good-friend">Wisdom teaches us how to be a good friend</h3>
<p>We now understand that friendship is a good thing, but what does it mean to be a good friend? Proverbs has many sayings that teach us how to interact with other people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle matters with wisdom (16:20)</li>
<li>Be considerate of others (27:14)</li>
<li>Be willing to forgive (10:12)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t meddle in other people&#39;s business (26:17)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t overstay your welcome (25:17)</li>
<li>Keep a right relationship with God (16:7; See also I John 4:19&ndash;20)</li>
</ul>

      And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
      22       For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head,
      And the LORD shall reward thee.
-->
<h3 id="sometimes-even-friends-will-disagree-and-that-s-a-good-thing">Sometimes even friends will disagree... and that&#39;s a good thing</h3>
<p>Proverbs 27:9 teaches us that counsel from friends is beneficial to us. Sometimes the counsel of friends will come in the form of correction. The wise person wants friends who will be honest with him. True friends will tell us the truth, even if it hurts (27:5–6; 29:5). We may not like the correction at first, but later we will see the value of it (28:23). This confrontation will help us mature (27:17).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This character-forming wisdom, rooted in God, is experienced in community. In studying sapiential [relating to wisdom] instruction, I have discovered the ubiquitous presence of conversation and conflict. Character development flourishes only in a community where healthy confrontation exists. Without the rigors of such an environment, individual character becomes undisciplined. The sages believed strongly in the principle that “iron sharpens iron” when it came to human interaction. Growth comes through struggle, and struggle is manifested as constructive conflict in healthy relationships.
—<em>Dave Bland</em><sup>[7]</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>We need to work hard at keeping our relationships with our friends strong, because if we offend them, it may be impossible to restore that relationship (<strong>18:19</strong>). The stronger the friendship, the greater the divide when offended. This is why some family feuds are so strong, and also why people who were once madly in love are now clamoring for a divorce. So we should take great care to fix problems with our closest friends when they are small.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-book-of-proverbs-says-about-families">What the book of Proverbs says about families</h2>
<h3 id="advice-to-parents">Advice to parents</h3>
<p>Proverbs teaches that parents should provide for their families (13:22; 31:13–15). It also tells parents that they should teach their children (22:6). The book of Proverbs is an example of this kind of teaching. The book itself is written as a father instructing his son.</p>
<p>We are to correct our children (29:15). If you love your children, you will correct them (13:24; 19:18; 22:15; 23:13–14; 29:17).</p>
<h3 id="advice-to-children">Advice to children</h3>
<p>Children are told to respect their parents (20:20), but unfortunately many children do not (30:11–14). They are told to listen to their parents (6:20–22; 15:5), because all parents were once young themselves and they learned these things from their experiences (1:8–9; 3:1–2; <strong>4:1–4</strong>; 13:1). Children are warned that taking advantage of parents is the same as stealing (28:24).</p>
<p>The choices of children can hurt the parents. If a child is disobedient and sinful, they can be a burden to their parents (10:1) and they can bring shame to them (19:26; 28:7). See also 15:20, 17:21, and 17:25. But obedient children can be a blessing to their father and mother (23:22–25; 27:11; 29:3).</p>
<h3 id="advice-to-the-single">Advice to the single</h3>
<p>There are more verses in Proverbs that talk about single people than married people. This is because these words were originally written as a father to his son, who was probably young and unmarried. We would be wise to teach these same words to our children. You may be married, but these words are still important because you can teach them to your children and grand children.</p>
<h4 id="it-is-a-good-thing-to-be-married-and-have-children">It is a good thing to be married and have children</h4>
<p>Proverbs talks about the blessings of marriage (18:22; 31:10) and having children (17:6).</p>
<h4 id="but-it-can-also-be-a-bad-thing">But it can also be a bad thing</h4>
<p>There&#39;s at least six verses in Proverbs that warn about marrying the wrong person (17:1; 19:13; 21:9, 19; 25:24), but many times they are not emphasized. Instead we only talk about how &quot;a man that findeth a wife findeth a good thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Why all these negative verses only about a bad wife? What about bad husbands? Again, Proverbs was written to teach sons. It was warning them about who they should marry. We could assume that if the book was written to daughters, that there would be plenty of warnings against bad husbands.</p>
<h4 id="be-careful-who-you-give-your-affection-to">Be careful who you give your affection to</h4>
<p>Some people will speak affectionate and flattering words, but their hearts and intentions are not right (5:1–6). Chapter 31 gives characteristics of a good wife. These are the things that we need to teach our children to look for in a potential spouse.</p>
<h4 id="let-god-help-you-find-a-spouse">Let God help you find a spouse</h4>
<p>Some preachers will quote Proverbs 18:22 and say that we have to actively and diligently search for a wife, but we have to remember that God is ultimately the one that will provide a good wife (19:14).</p>
<h2 id="what-the-book-of-proverbs-says-about-wealth">What the book of Proverbs says about wealth</h2>
<p>Wealth is a very important subject. It may not seem like a spiritual subject, but it can affect our lives in spiritually negative ways if we do not manage it correctly. Paul told Timothy that an unhealthy love for wealth is a source of evil (1 Tim. 6:10). Many marriage problems are because of wealth. Modern advice says not to do business with friends or family because it can cause fighting. These problems are not new, and there is some great advice in the book of Proverbs that can help shape our attitudes about wealth and how we spend it.</p>
<p>The Proverbs talk about wealth and other kinds of wealth, such as fields, plentiful harvests, and other possessions. This is natural for an agrarian culture where some people traded goods for other goods.</p>
<h3 id="where-does-wealth-come-from-">Where does wealth come from?</h3>
<p>By reading Proverbs, we can compile a list of what brings prosperity to people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wisdom (8:18, 21)</li>
<li>Hard work (10:4; 12:11; 12:27)</li>
<li>God (10:22)</li>
<li>Righteousness (13:21–22, 25; 15:6)</li>
<li>Obedience (13:18)</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading the above verses, you might draw the conclusion that the only people that are rich are those that love God, are wise, and work hard. But then why are many rich people wicked (28:6), foolish (30:22), and lazy? </p>
<h4 id="god-gives-some-blessings-to-all-men">God gives some blessings to all men</h4>
<p>Both rich and poor are created by God (22:2). All people are His creation, and so He loves them all and cares for them all. He even cares for the wicked. Jesus gave an example of this by saying that God sends rain to both the just and the unjust (Matthew 5:45). Someone may be blessed physically, but that does not mean that God is pleased with what they are doing.</p>
<h4 id="the-benefits-of-hard-work-is-a-universal-principle">The benefits of hard work is a universal principle</h4>
<p>We have to remember that Proverbs are not absolute promises, but principles. It&#39;s not an automatic guarantee that if you get up early every day and work hard that you will be rich, but the chances of you getting rich while lying in bed are very slim. God gives blessings to the righteous, but anyone, including a sinner, can benefit from the advice to work hard. Following are some basic principles about work that apply to everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not plant seeds, then you will not have a harvest (12:11; 28:19).</li>
<li>Some people only talk about what they want to do, but talk or ideas alone wont make you rich. You have to put actions to those words (14:23).</li>
<li>If you stay in bed all day, your fields won&#39;t be plowed, and neither will anyone pay you to sleep. If you want to get paid, you have to get out of bed (20:13).</li>
<li>You can start working hard on a project, but unless you continue working on it, it will not produce results (24:30–34).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="not-all-blessings-are-physical">Not all blessings are physical</h4>
<p>If you are righteous, God will bless you, but it will not always be with wealth or physical possessions. As humans, we often think that wealth is the most important thing for life, but God knows that there are other blessings that we need more than wealth.</p>
<p>In chapter 3, we see a description of Woman Wisdom. Verse 16 says that she holds life in her right hand and riches and honor in her left hand. In ancient Hebrew culture, the right hand was more honored than the left hand was honored (Gen. 48:14; Ecc. 10:12; Matt. 25:33)<sup>[1]</sup>. This shows us that wisdom may give riches, but riches are not as important as life is. Also, the two verses which immediately precede it (3:14–15) talk about how wisdom is better than gold and silver (see also 8:19 and 16:16). Wealth is not bad, but wisdom is better. God gave Solomon wealth, but only because he first asked for wisdom. Wisdom is not the only thing that is better than wealth. Bruce Waltke says, &quot;Wealth is a desirable state and the reward of wisdom (see 3:9–10), not the aim of one’s life.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup> Proverbs gives many things that are better than having wealth:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lips of knowledge (20:15)</li>
<li>A good name (22:1)</li>
<li>Being an honest person (19:22)</li>
<li>A good wife (31:10)</li>
<li>Walking in integrity (19:1)</li>
<li>Fear of God (15:16–17; 16:8; 16:19)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wealth-does-not-solve-all-problems">Wealth does not solve all problems</h3>
<p>Why does God say that so many things are more valuable than wealth? It is because there are many things that wealth cannot buy. Wealth gives you a sense of security (10:15), but wealth will fail you (11:28). Wealth cannot save a failing marriage. Wealth cannot save you from a uncurable disease. And wealth cannot help you in the afterlife (11:4, 28).</p>
<h4 id="wealth-cannot-buy-true-friends">Wealth cannot buy true friends</h4>
<p>When you have wealth, many people will want to be your friend (14:20; 19:4; 19:7), but are these people true friends? Will these same people want to be your friend when the wealth is gone?</p>
<h4 id="wealth-does-not-last-forever">Wealth does not last forever</h4>
<p>Proverbs 23:4–5 says that wealth grows wings and flies away (see also 27:23–24). </p>
<h4 id="wealth-can-bring-problems-to-your-life">Wealth can bring problems to your life</h4>
<p>Proverbs 17:1 suggests that wealth can be the cause of strife in a home. It can also make you proud (28:11) and demanding (18:23).</p>
<h3 id="god-gives-riches-so-that-we-might-share-with-others">God gives riches so that we might share with others</h3>
<p>We are commanded to give back to God (3:9–10), but we are also commanded to help the poor. God will provide for the poor (10:3; 15:25; <strong>22:22–23</strong>), and He may use us to do it. If we have something, and we have a neighbor that needs it, we should give it to them (3:27–28). Jesus repeated this command during the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:42). God gives wealth to certain people so that they would redistribute it to others. Those people who are virtuous will share what they have with the poor (29:7; 31:20). Part of the reason that there is poverty in the world is because of social and economic injustice (13:23). Those that give to the poor will be blessed (11:24; 14:21; <strong>19:17</strong>; 22:9; 28:27).</p>
<h4 id="god-will-not-listen-to-those-who-do-not-help-the-poor">God will not listen to those who do not help the poor</h4>
<p>All men are created in the image of God, and when we oppress any person, we insult God (14:31; 17:5). In Matthew 25, Jesus tells the story about people who will be punished because they neglected the poor. He said that when people neglect the poor, they are really neglecting Him (Matthew 25:41–46). See also 21:13, 28:27, and 29:14. Those that take advantage of the poor will be punished (22:16; 23:10–11).</p>
<h3 id="some-advice-about-using-wealth">Some advice about using wealth</h3>
<h4 id="save-for-the-difficult-times">Save for the difficult times</h4>
<p>We need to make plans about how we will spend our finances (21:5). The ant is used as an example of saving for difficult times (6:6–11). No one has to tell it what to do. It knows that winter is coming, and so it must gather food. The hard-worker does not need a leader, and in fact, he will likely become a leader (12:24). This hard work can keep you from becoming the slave of another. Jesus gave several stories of people who were given more authority because of their hard work. See also 10:5.</p>

<p>Working in something consistent that will bring a moderate reward is better than looking for new ways to not have to work hard (12:11). For example, there is a popular business book named <em>The 4-Hour Work Week</em>, which tells people that they can do little work and make a lot of wealth. Many times work is difficult, but trying to find an easier way may not be profitable (14:4). See also 13:11, 20:21, 21:5, and 28:20–22.</p>

> Rankin likewise concluded, "We have no reason to assume, in the absence of actual evidence, that at any time there was in Israel a purely secular proverb literature From the very outset in Israel's wisdom writings the religious sanction of right conduct, the motive supplied by the idea of God's blessing and cursing was present."  
> https://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/otesources/20-proverbs/text/articles/waltke_provtheology_bsac.htm pg 307

> Although some scholars have urged that the older strata of Hebrew wisdom was purely secular, it is difficult to conceive that a movement so broadly based in Hebrew society and so penetrating of the meaning of lifecould be purely secular, even in its most pragamtic form. The religious and the secular in the ancient Near East had an inseperable relationship.
> An Introduction to the Old Testament Wisdom Books p. 54

> In general... God does not communicate in wisdom literature quite so intimately as He does through the prophets. Rather His mode of self-revelation assumes the medium of human reason and nature. It falls in the broad range of what we now call "natural revelation." Yet we should not erroneously conclude that "special revelation" is not involved, since it definitely stands as the backdrop for human reason and natural observation. That is, man is not left aloof to figure out the universe apart from God.

## Wisdom comes from God

Proverbs 2:6 (KJV 1900)
      6       For the LORD giveth wisdom:
      Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.

## Prayer

## Fear of the Lord

On the Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge on chapter 1:

> Wisdom grounds moral education in a knowledge of God. The poem discloses this substructure, quoting one of the most repeated lines in the book: “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge.”11 That the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom means that without this relationship one will never acquire true wisdom. This “beginning” is not in the horizontal sense of missing the first tire in an obstacle course and just skipping to the next. Rather it is in the vertical sense of a ladder. If the student misses the first step of the ladder then progress cannot be made to the next step. What the letters of the alphabet are to reading and notes to music, the fear of the Lord is to wisdom.
> Proverbs and the Fromation of Character

> In our modern spirituality, “fear” is not typically a stance toward God which is advocated regularly from the pulpits. Nevertheless, Proverbs makes clear that the fear of the Lord is the essence of wisdom. At its most basic level, fearing the Lord means that the center of life is not our world; it is located beyond.14 To fear God is to realize that there is a moral locus outside of the self—a message which ought to be sounded from the pulpits. The beginning of wisdom is to come to the realization that fulfillment and satisfaction are outside our own power.
> Proverbs and the Fromation of Character

> Chapter Eight identifies God as the most fundamental resource for character formation. This chapter highlights what is referred to as the “Yahweh proverbs” in order to better understand the sages’ perspective on God’s involvement in human life. Yahweh is the ever-present, underlying force at work that initiates and sustains the educational process. The God of the sages does not remain aloof, watching from a distance as events unfold in the life of people. God does not sporadically intervene with a miracle here or there. Nor does the Lord display a cloud by day or a pillar of fire by night so that the people know which direction to go. Instead, the sages’ God is involved in the details of daily living, working behind the scenes in the experiences and actions of creation. Yahweh works through human thoughts and decisions, all the while honoring the choices individuals make for themselves. Through such intricate and lovingly patient work, God shapes the character and will of those who remain open to learning.

?? How many times is Lord used in Proverbs? https://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/otesources/20-proverbs/text/articles/waltke_provtheology_bsac.htm pg 304 says that it is 84 times.

> Becker concluded from his study of this term in the Law that the fear of the Lord denotes “reverence of Yahweh and the special aspect of loyalty to Him as the covenant God.”  
> https://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/otesources/20-proverbs/text/articles/waltke_provtheology_bsac.htm pg 312

> In contrast to love which denotes a spontaneous commitment out of appreciation, fear denotes a commitment out of awe and respect. This fear is not the numinous dread of a moment, but a lifetime stance of submission in reverent awe. Such an attitude is an essential spiritual condition of the heart if a man hopes to have a personal relationship with a God whose name and deeds are "terrible" (Exod. 34:10; Deut. 4:34; 28:58; Mal. 1:15; 3:23) and who is "great" and "holy" (2 Sam. 7:27; 1 Chron. 16:25; Ps. 99:3; 145:6).  
> https://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/ted_hildebrandt/otesources/20-proverbs/text/articles/waltke_provtheology_bsac.htm pg 312

> The phrase "the fear of the Lord" presents a paradox in both the prophetic and the sapiential literature: It is at one and the same time both the source and the substance, the cause and the effect. On the one hand, the term denotes the spiritual prerequisite for all ethical behavior, namely, a commitment to God out of awesome reverence for Him. On the other hand, it denotes the objective content of that which He demands through His spokesman whether it be the priest with the law, or the prophet with the word, or the wise man with his counsel (cf. Jer. 18:18). Thus the sage promised, "My son, if you accept my words...then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God" (Prov. 2:1-5). Stähli noted that in Proverbs "the fear of the Lord" is a close parallel to terms for wisdom and can almost be used as a synonym for knowledge (1:29; 2:5; cf. Isa. 11 :2; 33:6; Job 28:28).46 In Deuteronomy and the prophetic literature the fear of the Lord is both taught and learned (Deut. 31:12; 2 Kings 17:7, 25, 28, 32-39, 41).

!! Turn the following quote into a table:

> Also the wise men ascribe the same attributes and actions to Yahweh as those ascribed to him by the prophets. According to both circles He is the Creator of the cosmos (Deut. 10:14; Isa. 40:21-22; Prov. 3:19-20) and of all mankind (Deut. 4:32; Isa. 42:5; Prov. 14:31; 29:13). He is the same living God who will avenge wrong (Deut. 32:35, 40-41; Nahum 1:2; Prov. 25:21-22) and the same spiritual Being who comforts men and knows man's ways (Deut. 23:14; Jer. 16:17; Provo 5:21; 15:3). According to both, He is the sovereign Lord directing history (Deut. 4:19; 29:4, 26; Isa. 45:1-13; Prov. 16:1-9, 33; 19:21; 20:24 et passim) and is yet present in it, withholding and giving rain (Deut. 11:13-17; Hag. 1:10-11; Prov 3:9-10), disciplining His children (Deut. 8:5; Isa. 1:4-6; Prov. 3:11-12), and in His mercy answering their prayers (Deut. 4:29-31; Isa. 56:7; Prov. 15:8,29). According to both sources He is merciful (Deut. 4:31; 30:8; Isa. 63:7; Prov 28:13), wise (Deut. 4:26; Isa. 11:2-3; 31:2; Prov. 8:22-31), delights in justice and hates iniquity (Deut. 10:17; Isa. 1:16-17; Prov 11:1; 17:15), and has aesthetic-ethical sensibilities (Deut. 22:4-11; 23:10-14; Jer. 32:35; Prov. 3:32; 6:16-19; 11:20; 15:9 et passim).

> It is specifically ethical-religious wisdom that the Book of Proverbs discusses and recomends. This wisdom is exclusively functional; its purpose is to get people to behave morally. In contrast to speculative wisdom, ethical-religious wisdom has little to do knowledge and understanding of life in the universe, insofar as that knowledge is not oriented to human behavior.
> Region in Proverbs p. 55

> What appears to be utilitarian ethic is really religious, if we consider conformity with the world order as part of the religious system.
> Region in Proverbs p. 62

(This thinking of the world order was likely influenced by Egyptian Maat.)

> God's part in retribution is remote. He is not the dynamic God of the rest of the Bible, but a remote sovereign who observes man's actions and and puts certain inflexible rules into opperation. Almost every aspect of God found elsewhere in the Bible is lacking: righteousness,, personal love, vivid wrath, control of history, covenent, msytery. The lack of mention of God's covenant with Israel or any special relation with Israel&mdash;or Isreal itself for that matter&mdash;is the shapest distinction between wisdom literature and the rest of the Bible. The world order is momogeneous; it applies equally to all men. There is no place for any special involvement of the remote God with a certain people. Since the world order is static, history is irrelevant in Israelite wisdom as in Egyptian thought. The wise-men think only of the enduring, constant, all-inclusive patterns of life.  
> Ethical-religious wisdom (Proverbs) is distinctly anthropocentric. God's will is relevant only insofar as it is part of the order and man must know it in order to be in harmony with the order. "The notion that the purpose of human life is to serve and glorify Yahweh is entirely absent."  
> Region in Proverbs p. 63

This quote is from what the author calls the first stage of wisdom literature, where Israelite wisdom is heavily influenced by Egyptain thinking. The problem is, the author does not give exact dates (and says that there are no exact dates) and he also does not show what divisions or verses of the book specifically fall into this category or what reasoning he has in emphatically declaring that there are really three stages in Proverbs. At first, I thought he was using Whybray's division of the first 9 chapters of Proverbsas his stage 1, but he also uses 2:6 as a part of the second stage. So it seems that he just picks and chooses which verses go into the stages that he layed out, without giving evidence of why the verse fit in that stage instead of others.

<h2 id="who-is-the-preacher-">Who is &quot;the preacher?&quot;</h2>
<p>The word in Hebrew is <em>Qoheleth</em> and it means &quot;one who gathers.&quot; It might mean one who gathers people together to speak to them, or it might mean one who gathers ideas together, like a philosopher.</p>
<p>Is he Solomon? Many people think Qoheleth is Solomon because he is called the &quot;son of David&quot; (1:1). But the term &quot;son of David&quot; can be used for anyone in the lineage of David, as can be seen when Jesus is called the son of David (Matt. 1:1). </p>
<p>Another reason that people believe it is Solomon is because it says that he surpassed all of the previous rulers in Jerusalem (1:16; 2:9). (Though at the time of Solomon, there had been very few rulers in Jerusalem.)</p>
<p>It is possible that it is Solomon, but there is no real evidence of it. Because many people think it is Solomon, they come to the text with assumptions, such as the fact that Solomon was far from God in the latter part of his life. To avoid this problem, we will call the preacher <em>Qoheleth</em> in this textbook and try to understand the text for itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-structure-of-the-book">The structure of the book</h2>
<p>There are two people speaking in the book:</p>
<ol>
<li>A narrator speaks in 1:1-2, 7:27, and 12:8-14. He is telling the story of Qoheleth.</li>
<li>Qoheleth speaks in the rest of the book.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-theme-of-the-book">The theme of the book</h2>
<p>The book of Ecclesiastes is an understanding of life as it is. The word <em>vanity</em> is used frequently. The word could also be translated as &quot;breath&quot; (See 4:16). It shows that life is short, so we need to make the most of the time that we have. It is repeated many times in the book that we need to seize the day (2:24-25; 3:22; 5:18-19; 8:15; 9:7-10; 12:13).</p>
<p>Many of the things that Qoheleth says are not wrong, but he is looking at things from a very natural view. It is one-sided, but not necessarily wrong.</p>
<!--## The name of the book

In the Hebrew Bible this book is classified as one of the "Writings" and titled "Koheleth."

It isn't completely clear what the exact translation of "ecclesiastes" should be, but it is rendered in English as "preacher" or "one who addresses an assembly."

> The Hebrew word qōhelet is the Qal feminine  singular participle of the verb qāhal, meaning “to call,” “to assem-  ble.” Thus the nickname may allude to one who gathers an assembly  to address it or to one who gathers words for instruction. The femi-  nine participle is used elsewhere in the OT to refer to particular offices or occupations (Ezra 2:55; Neh. 7:57, 59).  
> The English title derives from the Septuagint (ekklēsiastēs) via the Latin Vulgate (Liber Ecclesiastes). The Septuagint translator(s) inter-  preted qōhelet to refer to a citizen of the assembly or ekklēsia. English  translations have traditionally translated qōhelet as “Preacher” (KJV,  RSV), which goes back to Luther’s translation of qōhelet as “der  Prediger.”[3] This translation is somewhat anachronistic, with its  overtones of the NT concept of the ekklēsia as the church. Qoheleth’s  “office” is clearly identified in the epilogue (12:8–14) as that of a wise  man, but “preacher” is helpful in that it alerts us to the fact that Qoheleth was wise and taught the people knowledge (12:10).   
> Baker Commentary, p. 20

## What is the message? Why is this negative book in the cannon?

> Abraham asserts that “to have a canon of Scripture is to have a  sophisticated means of grace which is related to formation in holy  living in a host of ways. On this . . . reading, Scripture functions to  bring one to faith, to make one wise unto salvation, to force one to  wrestle with awkward questions about violence and the poor, to com-  fort those in sorrow, and to nourish hope for the redemption of the  world.”[18] This is helpful to remember in terms of the canonicity of  Ecclesiastes. Thiselton notes, “Such texts as Job, Ecclesiastes, and  the parables do not function primarily as raw-material for Christian  doctrine. . . . Their primary function is to invite or to provoke the  reader to wrestle actively with the issues, in ways that may involve  adopting a series of comparative angles of vision.”[19] Ecclesiastes is  one of those books that force us to wrestle with very difficult ques-  tions that are pursued relentlessly. In the process it leads us back to  the starting point of faith, but this time to know it more fully. Faith,  we might remind ourselves, is a gift, but Ecclesiastes reminds us that  it is not cheap.  
> Baker, p. 23

> Rashbam locates the essence  of the argument of Ecclesiastes in 1:2–11. Ecclesiastes here contrasts  the transience of human life with the permanence of nature, thus  showing the latter’s advantage. None of the experiments in Eccle-  siastes is successful in dispelling this melancholy; the only adequate  response is to live in conformity to traditional values, to enjoy life  calmly while resigned to providence. Present mysteries will be recti-  fied in the future life.  
> Baker, p. 27

> Nathan Rosenthal in his work on Ecclesiastes (1858) still main-  tains Solomonic author­ship.[45] In his view, Solomon wrote the  book to demonstrate that wisdom is only useful when combined with  the fear of God and the keeping of his commands.
> Baker, p. 28

> Contra Jerome, Luther, Melanchthon, and  Brenz insist that Ecclesiastes is fundamentally positive about civic  life even as it wrestles with the difficulties of poor leadership, a prob-  lem with which the Reformers were only too familiar. Luther read 
Ecclesiastes as a book about politics and the family, about human  existence in the context of creation order. He envisaged Solomon not  as a solitary but as a political figure deeply concerned about social  life. In contrast to Jerome’s allegorical and christological exegesis of  4:4–12, Luther read this text as a strong affirmation of communal and  civic life.
> Baker, p. 38

> Qohelethh demonstrates the futility of trying to find meaning in a fallen world apart from remembering one’s creator and starting with the fear of the LORD, but he also affirms life, and this tension is resolved at the conclusion of his journey precisely through his exhortation to remember one’s creator. Thus the futility Ecclesiastes exposes is that of trying to find meaning while embracing human autonomy in a world which depends at every point upon its creator.

> Remembering his creator is the solid ground to which Qohelethh finally returns and which enables him to affirm life—thereby granting the carpe diem passages the final say—without detracting from the brokenness of life as evident in the threefold “before” in 12:1–7.

> In my reading of Ecclesiastes, resolution comes through remembering your creator before … before … before … The decentering of the ego evoked by such remembrance puts one in a position of creature before the Creator and thus in a position to receive instruction and to obey, rather than relying on reason, experience and observation as the royal route to truth.

> The carpe diem passages in Ecclesiastes affirm feasting but within the context of a hallowing of the ordinary.

## Authorship

### Possibly Solomon?

Authorship of Ecclesiastes is often ascribed to Solomon.

> Ecclesiastes 1:1 — The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

Jewish and early Christian tradition attribute the book to Solomon. The author identifies himself as "the son of David, king in Jerusalem" (1:1). He also refers to himself as "the Preacher" (1:1,2,12; 7:27; 12:8,9,10). Many of the experiences spoken of in Ecclesiastes correspond quite well with what we know about Solomon's life. Internal evidences point to Solomon. Note the references to:

* His wisdom (1:16; cf. 1 Ki 3:12)
* His building activities (2:4-6; cf. 1 Ki 7:1-12)
* His wealth (2:7-9; cf. 2 Chr 9:13-28 - all the things he built would require the wealth of an exceptionally wealthy king)
* His activities after writing this book (12:9-10; cf. 1 Ki 4:30-34)

According to rabbinic tradition, Ecclesiastes was written by Solomon in his old age and possibly edited under Hezekiah. If Solomon is indeed the author, then the date the book was written would be around 945 B.C.

### Doubtfully Solomon?

Critical scholars have long rejected the idea of Solomon having written this book before the Babylonian exile. Part of the argument is that the presence of Persian "loan-words" and Aramaic figures of speech, point to a date sometime after the exile.

Some question whether certain conditions described in the book (3:16; 4:13-16; 5:8) existed during the reign of Solomon. But these conditions could have been noted by Solomon in neighboring countries, or in lower-level positions of his administration.

### Frame narrator

> A breakthrough for literal interpretation came with Rashbam  (1085–1155). He interprets according to the principle that the text has  only one meaning. Rashbam displays great sensitivity to the literary nature of Ecclesiastes and was the first to realize that Qoheleth  was set within a framework; 1:1–2 and the last seven verses were written by those who edited the book.
> Baker, p. 27

## Key Verse

> Ecclesiastes 12:13 — Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

## Key Words

Occurring more than 25 times:
* vanity
* under the sun

Life lived without good results, no matter how lived, is a waste and vain. "All is vanity" (1:2). This theme is repeated by the Preacher time and again:

* Prior to describing his search for meaning (1:14)
* Pleasure is vain (2:1)
* Labor is vain (2:11,22-23; 4:4)
* Human wisdom is vain (2:15)
* All life is vain (2:17)
* Leaving an inheritance is vain (2:18-21)
* Earthly existence is vain (3:19-21)
* Acquiring riches over family is vain (4:7-8)
* Political popularity is vain (4:16)
* Many dreams and many words is vain (5:7)
* Loving abundance is vain (5:10)
* Wealth without the gift of God to enjoy it is vain (6:2)
* Wandering desire is vain (6:9)
* Foolish laughter is vain (7:6)
* Injustice in this life is vain (8:14)
* The days of darkness is vain (11:8)
* Childhood and youth is vain (11:10)

* At the conclusion of the book (12:8)

Indeed, the key word in this book is "vanity." It occurs 35 times in 29 verses. It means "futility, uselessness, nothingness." But a key phrase to be noted is "under the sun." It is found 29 times in 27 verses. It suggests that this message of vanity is true when one looks at life purely from an earthly perspective. Leave God and eternity out of the equation, and life is truly vanity!

## Contents

The 12 Chapters of this book contains the reflections and experiences of someone whose mind is in conflict over the problems of life. What value or purpose is there for living?

After speaking of his disillusionments, he presents a materialistic view of life where there is nothing better than the carnal enjoyment of the pleasures of life.

Throughout the book the writer is struggling with this as though he would utter profound truths, he would often return to the materialistic theme. Koheleth is in conflict in his own mind throughout the book that thought he speaks great truths at time, he'll revisit the value of materialism and pleasure. He is struggling and confused himself until the final conclusion in 12:13. We live in an age of confusion. We must have our answer ready. 

* Our witness must be consistent and clear. 
* They are confused as they do not live for God. 
* Solomon was confused when he left off God's Word.
* The majority of our witness will be in flashes ... Just a word here or a smile there ... Rare are occasions to admonish for hours at a time ... More often will be the stressful moments and timely questions
* Not memorizing the answers but having an experience. (Like when taking a test in school and then the teacher randomizes or shuffles the test questions.)
* Our testimony should be outflow of our experience. Walking with Jesus. His person.

The book concludes with the author apparently emerging from his doubts and reaching the noble conclusion in 12:13. Therefore another message in this book is the importance of serving God throughout life. This is the message the Preacher would leave with the young (11:9-12:1), and is stated in his final words:

## Epicureanism and other philosophies in Ecclesiastes

Ecclesiastes prods us to consider our presentation of the Gospel. It is common for the upright to become flabbergasted by the logical gymnastics and deceptions used to justify sin, denial of God and explain life. The contrast of light and darkness is great and our thoughts may be "that's just stupid", but our Gospel presentation must be more evangelistic than that. 

Paul probably was dumbfounded internally by what he found at Athens, but his chosen action was a clear presentation of the Gospel.

> Acts 17:23 — For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.

The author of Ecclesiastes does this well as he suggests to the reader, "Ok, let us consider to the end what you have concluded about life." Does life have a point? If so, what is the point? How can we make sense of being here?

Ecclesiastes does not teach epicureanism or any of the several other philosophies suggested in it. Ecclesiastes is a mirror held up to humanity. This book is a self-look and inspection of the human condition and some common conclusions. Koheleth helps us consider who we are and why we are under the sun by walking down the different avenues common to man. 

One example of the philosophies considered in Ecclesiastes is epicureanism:

> "Epicureanism is an ancient school of philosophy founded in Athens by Epicurus. It rejects determinism and advocated hedonism (pleasure as the highest good), but of a restrained kind: mental pleasure was regarded more highly than physical, and the ultimate pleasure was held to be freedom from anxiety and mental pain, especially that arising from needless fear of death and of the gods."

> Ecclesiastes 2:24 — There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

> Ecclesiastes 3:12,13 — I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. 13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

The conclusion to epicureanism or any of the other human philosophies void of the one true God, is that these "streets" are "dead end streets." Knowing this from the beginning, we must be more prepared to reach out to the lost and better explain the gospel than just resorting to "bullying" and "manipulative" tactics.

How ready is our answer for those caught in the snare of the enemy? Some absurdities when humanity looks for fulfillment and meaning while shutting God out concern:

* Gender (Genesis 1:27)
* Marriage (Matthew 19:5,6)
* Truth is relative (John 18:37,38; John 14:6; 1 John 5:20)
* Do what feels good (Psalm 16:11; Proverbs 21:17; Galatians 5:19-21)
* Hypocrisy in religion (Matthew 7:5; James 1:26)
* Religion and violence (James 1:27)

## Quotable Book

* There is nothing new under the sun (1:9)
* To everything there is a season (3:1)
* Two are better than one (4:9)
* Eat, drink, and be merry (8:15)
* Time and chance happen to them all (9:11)
* He who digs a pit will fall into it (10:8)
* Money answers everything (10:19)

Ecclesiastes is one of the more quotable books of the Bible. But, should we? How should we interpret and use this book? Like the book of Job, the best counsel can be found at the end of the book. The advice in-between must be taken with caution.

Throughout the book, we will find what Koholeth later describes as "goads" and "nails."

> Ecclesiastes 12:11 — The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

These are wise sayings that will "prod" our thinking, and exhortations that will provide stability and direction for living. Ecclesiastes is certainly a book worthy of careful study!

<h2 id="under-the-sun-chapters-1-2-">Under the sun (chapters 1–2)</h2>
<p>In these two chapters, we have an introduction, the search for meaning in life, and some conclusions made from the search.</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-futility-1-3-11-">Examples of futility (1:3–11)</h3>

<p>With the curiosity of man and all his efforts, the more he learns the more questions he raises.</p>
<h4 id="absence-of-newness-1-9-11-">Absence of newness (1:9–11)</h4>
<h3 id="the-search-for-meaning-1-12-2-23-">The search for meaning (1:12–2:23)</h3>
<p>Those spiritully minded do not settle for &quot;life is vain&quot; but they search for meaning <strong>beyond</strong> this life. If the answer is not found beneath the sun, then it is found above the sun, beyond ourselves. In God, we find meaning in this life. In God, we learn how to live in this world that He created for us.</p>
<p>For every need of man there is a corresponding satisfaction (hunger—food, etc.). If we find a desire for which nothing in this world can satisfy, it is logical to assume we are made for another world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Christian says, &#39;Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well, there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing.<br>—C. S. Lewis</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="acquiring-wisdom-and-knowledge-1-12-18-">Acquiring wisdom and knowledge (1:12–18)</h4>
<p>The search of the natural man for satisfaction and happiness. Qoheleth explains how he reached the conclusions stated in 1:12–13. Qoheleth also expresses what he had learned in his searching:</p>
<ol>
<li>All lifestyles are meaningless (1:14)</li>
<li>Nothing can be changed (1:15)</li>
<li>Knowledge is useless (1:16–17)</li>
<li>Desire for knowledge brings much pain (1:18) </li>
</ol>
<p>Qoheleth is not anti-knowledge, but he is concluding rightly that human knowledge without reference to God is <strong>never satisfying</strong>.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes 1:18 says, &quot;For in much wisdom is much grief.&quot; But many other places in the Bible say that wisdom helps in our life. Why does this say it differently? Wisdom does help in our lives, but it also brings a burden. For example, before the radio, we did not know about the problems in other parts of the world. Now we can know about wars and other problems in every corner of the globe. The book of Proverbs teaches us that thieves get rich and wicked people rule&mdash;this is the hard truth that wisdom teaches us.</p>

<p>The main thought is that some answers will not be found here on earth. They answers are found &quot;beyond the sun&quot; and are spiritual in nature. Under the sun, you will not find the answer why you are under the sun. The answer is <strong>beyond</strong> the sun.</p>
<h2 id="god-controls-the-seasons-of-life-chapter-3-">God controls the seasons of life (chapter 3)</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This chapter shows us that there are many different seasons in life. These seasons are out of our control. We have to learn to trust God even if it is a season of difficulty. There are many ideas in this chapter that correspond to Jesus&#39; teaching about trust in God from Matthew chapter 6. We need to live for today and not worry about tomorrow. Instead of looking for a better time, we need to focus on the time we have now.</p>
<h3 id="there-is-a-time-for-everything-v-1-8-">There is a time for everything (v. 1–8)</h3>
<p>We know from other Scriptures that God is in control, and that He has a plan (Jer.29:11; Dan. 2:21; Amos 3:6; Job 1:10; Rom. 8:28; Matt. 5:45–48).</p>
<h3 id="man-s-god-given-task-v-9-15-">Man&#39;s God-given task (v. 9–15)</h3>
<p>God has created humanity and the world. He has given us work to do. We are to do that work, rejoice, do good, eat, drink, and enjoy the results of our labor.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-v-16-22-">Conclusion (v. 16–22)</h3>
<p>Qoheleth is discouraged because everywhere he looks he sees wickedness. But he knows that there is a season for everything, and though the wicked may have a season of prosperity, there will come a season of judgment.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-of-social-evils-chapter-4-">The problems of social evils (chapter 4)</h2>
<h3 id="oppression-v-1-3-">Oppression (v. 1–3)</h3>
<p>Qohelet notices that those that are in power use that power to oppress others. These verses are used by some to show that Qohelet is likely not Solomon, because Solomon had power to stop oppression, but here Qohelet cannot.</p>
<p>As Christians, we know that power and authority does not always have to result in oppression (2 Cor. 1:24; 4:5; 1 Peter 5:3).</p>
<h3 id="envy-as-motivation-for-work-v-4-6-">Envy as motivation for work (v. 4–6)</h3>
<p>We see here the observation that people will work hard because of envy. We see what other people have, and we want those things, too. We know that we can only have them if we work for them. </p>
<p>In verse 5, we see similarities with how the fool is described in Proverbs (Prov. 6:10; 24:33).</p>
<h3 id="loneliness-v-7-12-">Loneliness (v. 7–12)</h3>
<p>Loneliness is not something that God wants for man (Gen. 2:18), and He promised Israel that He would not leave them alone (Is. 41:10).</p>
<h3 id="government-problems-v-13-16-">Government problems (v. 13–16)</h3>
<p>Kings may be willing to listen when they are young, but when they are old, they no longer seek advice.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-worship-and-wealth-chapter-5-">Thoughts on worship and wealth (chapter 5)</h2>
<h3 id="worship-v-1-7-">Worship (v. 1–7)</h3>
<h4 id="sacrifices-v-1-">Sacrifices (v. 1)</h4>
<p>Qohelet warns about making the &quot;sacrifice of fools.&quot; &quot;The sacrifice of the fools should be thought of not as a denial of the value of sacrifice per se but as a critique of superficial religion that goes through the rituals with many words but no awareness of God.&quot;[1] There are other warnings in the Old Testament about offering vain sacrifices to God, such as 1 Samuel 15:22–23, Psalm 40:6, and Isaiah 1:11. These verses combined show us that God is not pleased with sacrifices if the heart of the giver was unclean.</p>
<h4 id="prayer-v-2-3-">Prayer (v. 2–3)</h4>
<p>In verse 1, there is instruction that those that go to the temple should be ready to listen. The idea is continued through verse 7. It is instruction to listen more than we talk, and specifically to listen more to God than we talk to Him. The principles of listening to instruction and controlling how much we talk are found often in the book of Proverbs (Prov. 2:2; 4:20; 5:1; 15:31; 18:15; 21:13; 22:17; 23:12; 25:12; 28:9). There is considerable similarities with Ecclesiastes 5:3b, which says, &quot;a fool’s voice is known by multitude of words&quot; and Proverbs 17:28, which says, &quot;Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise.&quot; Jesus also warned against praying with &quot;vain repetitions&quot; and thinking that your prayer will be heard because you use many words (Matt. 6:7).</p>
<h4 id="vows-v-4-7-">Vows (v. 4–7)</h4>
<p>Qohelet continues the idea of being careful with our words by giving advice on making vows to God. He said that it is better to not make a vow than to make a vow and break it. Jesus went farther with this teaching, and He said that we shouldn&#39;t make any vows at all (Matt. 5:33–37).</p>
<h3 id="oppression-and-wealth-v-8-17-">Oppression and wealth (v. 8–17)</h3>
<h4 id="oppression-by-government-v-8-9-">Oppression by government (v. 8–9)</h4>
<h4 id="the-burden-of-wealth-v-10-17-">The burden of wealth (v. 10–17)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wealth never satisfy (v. 10)</li>
<li>When you have more wealth, you have more problems (v. 11)</li>
<li>Wealth can cause anxiety, which robs you of sleep (v. 12)</li>
<li>We cannot take wealth with us to death (v. 13–17)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-gift-of-god-v-18-20-">The gift of God (v. 18–20)</h3>
<p>Wealth may not satisfy, but God does give blessings to every person. They can eat, drink and enjoy life. This is similar to statements in 2:24–26 and 9:7–10.</p>

<h3 id="some-cannot-enjoy-their-profit-v-1-2-">Some cannot enjoy their profit (v. 1–2)</h3>
<p>Qohelet now continues his observations on wealth. He talks about an &quot;evil&quot; thing, that is, that man works hard and gets wealth, but he cannot enjoy it. We do not know what the circumstances are that prevent him from enjoying his wealth, but we know that for some reason it is given to another to enjoy.</p>
<h3 id="long-life-does-not-guarentee-hapiness-v-3-6-">Long life does not guarentee hapiness (v. 3–6)</h3>
<p>Long life (Prov. 3:2) and many children (Psalm 127:4) were considered great blessings in ancient Israel, but Qohelet says that even these cannot bring rest to a weary life. He says that the stillborn baby who has never known life is better than the person who has long life. he says this because the stillborn does not have to face the troubles of life.</p>
<h3 id="appetite-is-never-satisfied-v-7-ndash-9-">Appetite is never satisfied (v. 7&ndash;9)</h3>
<p>We work hard for food, and then we eat it. Afterward we are hungry again. Hunger is a good thing, because it makes us to depend on God (Matt. 5:6).</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-to-the-search-for-meaning-v-10-12-">Conclusion to the search for meaning (v. 10–12)</h3>
<p>Thses verse conclude Qohelet&#39;s search for meaning. &quot;Here leaves his explicit search for meaning and in the second half of the book focuses on advice and commentary about the future.&quot;[1] Verse 10 says &quot;that which hath been is named already,&quot; and it is repeating the idea that there is nothing new under the sun (3:15).</p>

<h2 id="better-and-balanced-living-chapter-7-">Better and balanced living (chapter 7)</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-to-chapter-7">Introduction to Chapter 7</h3>
<p>In the remaining six chapters are a mixture of proverbs and narration designed to make the most of life &quot;under the sun.&quot; In other words, while life under the sun is &quot;vanity,&quot; how then should we live? Human Wisdom is limited in providing answers. Notice how skewed and limited wisdom is when God is not included in the equation.</p>
<h3 id="proverbs-on-better-living-v-1-13-">Proverbs on better living (v. 1–13)</h3>
<p>&quot;These proverbs are full of irony, and Qohelet often starts off sounding very much like Proverbs but then gives the proverb an ironic twist.&quot;[1] An example would be verse 1, which starts off by saying, &quot;A good name is better than precious ointment.&quot; This is very similar to Proverbs 22:1, which says, &quot;A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.&quot; But the next line in Ecclesiastes 7:1 is very different from anything in Proverbs. It says, &quot;and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.&quot; Why does Qohelet say this? &quot;Even if parallels to this proverb might be found in the broader wisdom literature, the appearance of it here, in light of Qohelet’s general teaching about death (3:18–21 and 12:1–7), supports an interpretation that this proverb indicates Qohelet’s world-weariness.&quot;[2] &quot;Qohelet attempts to answer the question as to the nature of the good life by looking again at traditional wisdom. Not surprisingly, therefore, the dominant form is that of the proverb. He starts with traditional wisdom and then problematizes this each time, so that we are left with no clear answer as to what constitutes the good life. The sort of wisdom that Proverbs offers would appear to be deeply problematic and to offer no secure place to stand.&quot;[3] Two themes that are prominent in this section are death (v. 1b, 2, 4, and perhaps 8) and wisdom and folly (v. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12).[4]</p>
<p>He concludes this section in verse 13 by saying that the world is bent and broken, but he cannot see any further than that. &quot;It is as though his world is confined to that ushered in by Gen. 3, the fall. It is true, as Qohelet finds again and again, that an empirical approach to our present fallen world makes life appear utterly enigmatic. But the larger context of Gen. 3, of creation and redemption through the line of Abraham, alerts us that God is at work making straight what has been bent and broken.&quot;[5]</p>
<h3 id="counsel-for-balanced-living-v-14-29-">Counsel for balanced living (v. 14–29)</h3>
<p>The second half of the chapter offers &quot;counsel for balanced living.&quot; These are challenging and difficult statements which should be understood in their context, and in the context of the Bible as a whole. It appears Qohelet is mainly warning against extremism and against the presumption that one can find the answer to every question in life.</p>
<h4 id="moderation-in-wisdom-and-folly-v-14-22-">Moderation in wisdom and folly (v. 14–22)</h4>
<p>In these verses Qohelet comes to the conclusion that it is not good to be too wise or too righteous. He says this because he sees the righteous, the wicked, the wise, and the fool all meeting the same end. &quot;The two case studies present us with a paradox, and Qohelet surely wanted his listener/reader to be shocked by what he said. He saw the righteous perishing and the wicked living long. This is the polar opposite of what some strands of biblical teaching indicate. For instance, certain legal portions of the Bible teach that observation of the law prolongs life (Exod. 20:12; Deut. 4:40), and the wisdom teachers instructed that righteousness led to life (Prov. 3:1–2), while the wicked suffered and died early (Ps. 1).&quot;[6] &quot;What could it possibly mean to be moderately righteous and moderately wicked?&quot;[7] There are two ways of interpreting this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Qohelet warns against seeking righteousness and wisdom with too much fervor</li>
<li>he guards against false pretense in righteousness and wisdom.[8]</li>
</ol>
<!-- Qohelet refers to cursing others, but one cannot help reflecting on how close he has come to calling evil good and good evil (cf. Isa. 5:20). In Isa. 5 such people are described as wise in their own eyes and ripe for God’s judgment, his curse.

<h3 id="civil-duties-v-1-9-">Civil duties (v. 1–9)</h3>
<p>Verse one asks, &quot;Who is like a wise man?&quot; Qoholet searched for a wise man, who knew the interpretation of a thing. Qoholet knew that wisdom makes a man happier. &quot;The shining face generally speaks of favour. Here it speaks of the wise man who is visibly gracious in his demeanour, and (as the next phrase says) whose gentleness is obvious in his facial expression.&quot;[1] Compare to Numbers 6:25.</p>
<p>In verse two, Qohelet advises to obey the command of the king. In Romans 13, Paul gives similar command to obey the government. Primarily, we honor government authority as part of our obedience to God. &quot;It appears that the Jewish princes and chiefs took an oath of fidelity to their kings. This appears to have been done to David, 2 Samuel 5:1–3; to Joash, 2 Kings 11:17; and to Solomon, 1 Chronicles 29:24.&quot;[2] We can agree with Qoholet&#39;s advice here, from both an Old Testament and New Testament perspective. Yet one must say that it sounds self-serving if Qoholet was Solomon, who was a king himself.</p>
<p>We also recognize that we are always to obey God rather than man if the two contradict (Acts 4:19). &quot;Many passages in the Old Testament witness to the limits which loyalty to God must set on courtly tact and submissiveness.&quot;[3]</p>
<!-- "The highest wisdom is submission to things as they are ... Yet in doing all this there will abide in the heart the recognition of abounding injustice." (Morgan)-->
<p>If the lack of wisdom discouraged Qoholet in Ecclesiastes 8:6–7, he found the powerlessness of man in the face of death to be yet more despairing. Under the sun, he saw that death allows no winners, and there is no release from that war. He knew that part of man&#39;s misery on this earth was to be ruled by others oppressively.</p>
<h3 id="the-certainty-of-just-judgment-v-10-13-">The certainty of just judgment (v. 10–13)</h3>
<p>Qoholet saw that the wicked die, and their evil is soon forgotten. With his <em>under the sun</em> thinking, Qoholet despaired that the wicked are not punished after death.</p>
<p>In verse 12–13 Qohelet says that it will be well with the righteous and not well with the wicked.</p>

<h3 id="the-despair-of-death-v-1-6-">The despair of death (v. 1-6)</h3>
<p>The righteous, and the wise, and their works, are <strong>in the hand of God</strong>. Qohelet observes that <strong>all people</strong> die, no matter who they are or what they have done. &quot;To all appearances, God is just not interested. The things that are supposed to matter most to Him turn out to make no difference—or none that anyone can see—to the way we are disposed of in the end. Moral or immoral, religious or profane, we are all mown down alike.&quot;<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<h3 id="the-hope-of-life-v-7-10-">The hope of life (v. 7-10)</h3>
<p>He then says that we may all die, but we should still enjoy life while we have it. He also says that we should work hard. &quot;Man was not created to be idle, he was not elected to be idle, he was not redeemed to be idle, he was not quickened to be idle, and he is not sanctified by God&#39;s grace to be idle.&quot;<sup>[2]</sup></p>
<h3 id="taken-in-an-evil-time-v-11-12-">Taken in an evil time (v. 11-12)</h3>
<p>No amount of wisdom or skill appears to prevent the evil time. Bad things happen as a result of humanity’s choices; as a result of sin and forsaking God. But none of them happen “accidentally” or apart from God’s will.</p>
<h3 id="wisdom-is-better-but-it-is-often-unnoticed-v-13-18-">Wisdom is better, but it is often unnoticed (v. 13-18)</h3>
<p>Qohelet tells the story of a wise man that saved his city, but was soon forgotten. He says that wisdom is better than many things, but it is not always beneficial because it is not heard.</p>

<h2 id="folly-and-wisdom-chapter-10-">Folly and wisdom (chapter 10)</h2>
<h3 id="folly-disgraces-v-1-7-">Folly disgraces (v. 1–7)</h3>
<h4 id="folly-disgraces-a-wise-man-s-honor-v-1-">Folly disgraces a wise man&#39;s honor (v. 1)</h4>
<p>This is an obvious statement: dead flies spoils the perfume. Compare it with 9:18, which says &quot;...one sinner destroyeth much good.&quot; So does a little folly to one respected for wisdom and honor.</p>
<h4 id="folly-disgraces-the-fool-by-revealing-itself-v-2-3-">Folly disgraces the fool by revealing itself (v. 2–3)</h4>
<p>The right hand was regarded as the side of strength, skill, good and favor and the left hand was regarded as weak and bad. &quot;To have one&#39;s heart at his left side is to have the &#39;springs of life&#39; (Proverbs 4:23) located in the realm of practical and spiritual incompetence.&quot;[1] He shows everyone that he is a fool.</p>
<h4 id="folly-disgraces-in-high-places-v-4-7-">Folly disgraces in high places (v. 4–7)</h4>
<p>Folly is set in great dignity. Some lowly men are unwisely exalted (servants on horses). Foolish men are promoted or accepted to positions of great leadership, while some noblemen are humbled (princes walk on the ground like servants).</p>
<h3 id="evidence-of-folly-and-wisdom-v-8-20-">Evidence of folly and wisdom (v. 8–20)</h3>
<h4 id="foolishness-in-action-v-8-11-">Foolishness in action (v. 8–11)</h4>
<p>The fool doesn&#39;t wisely consider the future, but wise use of one&#39;s time in the present can make for a much better future.</p>
<h4 id="the-babbling-talk-of-the-foolish-v-12-14-">The babbling talk of the foolish (v. 12–14)</h4>
<p>The fool is known by his many words, and by his presumption about the future when no man knows what is to be. Previously Qohelet had confidently stated that there is nothing beyond this life, and that this life should be lived with an under the sun premise. He now casts more doubt upon that premise.</p>
<h4 id="the-fool-at-work-v-15-">The fool at work (v. 15)</h4>
<p>Fools have no desire to work, or when they do work they quickly become wearied. They can&#39;t see that it is wise to work now in order to prepare for the future. The fool works hard to get out of work.</p>
<p>They do not even know how to go to the city! The fool has no sense of direction or goal. They live their life as if it were meaningless, directionless. &quot;In a fine note of sarcasm, this proverb says that a person may be so involved in arguing about the universe that he misses what the ordinary person is concerned about, namely, finding the way home.&quot;[2]</p>
<h4 id="how-foolishness-corrupts-a-nation-v-16-20-">How foolishness corrupts a nation (v. 16–20)</h4>
<p>Qohelet understood that a land was blessed by good, faithful leaders, but cursed under wicked and incompetent leaders. If Ecclesiastes 10:18 symbolizes the fall of a nation, then the following reasons give the reason for the fall: leaders who are foolish, selfish, and concerned only for their own pleasure and good. &quot;They do nothing in order; turn night into day, and day into night; sleep when they should wake, and wake when they should sleep; attending more to chamberings and banquetings, than to the concerns of the state.&quot;[3]</p>

<p><strong>Prudence</strong> is the skill and good judgment in the use of resources.</p>
<h3 id="the-prudent-person-invests-v-1-2-6-">The prudent person invests (v. 1, 2, 6)</h3>
<p>The counsel is &quot;do not hoard what you have, but sow so that you can get more.&quot; It is about careful investment.</p>
