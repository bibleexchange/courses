# The Psalms of Thanksgiving

[[I should move this chapter after the chapter on praise, because the major difference between these psalms and psalms of praise is that psalms of thanksgiving are for something specific, and psalms of praise are for the general goodness of God. Or I could combine them into one chapter and make two sections.]]

## Introduction

What are the psalms of thanksgiving? They express thanksgiving for what God has done or in anticipation of what He will do. They may be individual (Chapters 9, 10, 30, 32, 34, 40, 41, 92, 107, 116, 138), or national (Chapters 65-68, 118, 124).

Or individual: 30, 34, 41, 66, 92, 116, 118, 138 and national: 67, 75, 107, 124, 129, 136 (Psalms: A Guide to Studying the Psalter By W. H. Jr. Bellinger, p. 108)

> The two components essential to the genre are: (1) the psalmist’s report about his crisis, and (2) the statement or declaration that the crisis has passed and his deliverance is an accomplished fact. The latter element is that which distinguishes these psalms from the lament. Whereas the crisis of the lament is current in the poet’s life, the psalm of thanksgiving reports a crisis that, while it is still very real in the psalmist’s memory, has in fact passed. The following elements may be found in psalms of thanksgiving.

Let us not just read these Psalms, but do what is instructed! Ask yourself, "For what am I giving thanks?""

## Structure of the psalm of thanksgiving

### Introduction

The introduction is different in each of these psalms, as can be seen by comparing the introductions to Psalms 30, 92, and 118. In Psalm 30:1 the psalmist states that he will praise God, Psalm 92:1-4 shows that praising God is a good thing, and Psalm 118:1 is a call for others to praise God. Though they are different, all of them encourage praise to God.

### Narrative

#### Crisis

#### Plea for help

#### Report of Deliverance

This is what sets the psalms of thanksgiving apart from the other psalms.
