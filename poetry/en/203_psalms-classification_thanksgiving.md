## The psalms of thanksgiving

### Introduction

What are the psalms of thanksgiving? They express thanksgiving for what God has done or in anticipation of what He will do. They are very much like the psalms of praise, but what makes them different is that include a report of deliverance from a specific crisis. They may be individual (9, 10, 30, 32, 34, 40, 41, 92, 107, 116, 138), or national (65–68, 118, 124).

### Structure of the psalm of thanksgiving

The structure between these psalms can vary, but they usually contain an **introduction**, a **narrative**, and a **conclusion**.

#### Introduction

The introduction is different in each of these psalms, as can be seen by comparing the introductions to Psalms 30, 92, and 118. In Psalm 30:1 the psalmist states that he will praise God, Psalm 92:1–4 shows that praising God is a good thing, and Psalm 118:1 is a call for others to praise God. Though they are different, all of them encourage praise to God.

#### Narrative

This can contain the **crisis**, a **plea for help**, and a **report of deliverance**. The report of deliverance is what sets the psalms of thanksgiving apart from the other psalms.

#### Conclusion

Like the conclusion, this varies in the different psalms. Some of them end with a call to praise, and others such as Psalm 32: 8–10, 18:25–36, 32:8–10, and 92:12–15 end with instruction for those that are listening.

As an example, following is the structure of Psalm 30:

1. Introduction (v. 1–5)
2. Narrative
  1. Crisis (v. 6–7)
  2. Plea for help (v. 8–10)
  3. Deliverance (v. 11)
3. Conclusion (v. 12)

**Exercise:** find the structure of Psalm 116.

### Temple ceremony in the psalms of thanksgiving

We can see from Psalms 66:13, 92:13, and 116:19 that these psalms were said in the temple. Sacrifices and vows to make sacrifices are mentioned in 66:13–15, 107:22, 116:17–19, and 118:27. It is believed that these psalms were said before a sacrifice of thanksgiving was made.[1] We can read about this thank offering in Lev. 7:11 and 22:29. "116:13 also refers to the cup of salvation, which is usually thought to indicate a drink offering rather than being a mere metaphor."[2]

Since these psalms were sung in the temple, they were a part of public and not private worship. There are many references in these psalms to the people listening. They are called "those who fear God" (66:16), "God's people" (116:14, 18–19), "saints" (* 30:4; 31:23), and the "righteous" (32:11). The singer encourages those listening to thank God (such as in 118:1–4). It's possible that the congregation joined with the lead singer in 118:24–27, because it changes from using the singular pronoun "I" to the plural "we."

> But did every individual who escaped a life-threatening crisis compose a psalm as an expression and instrument of his gratitude? It is hardly possible that the capabilities of the common worshiper would have come up to that level of literary accomplishment. What we have in the Psalter is most likely samples of songs that accomplished composers had provided for use in the temple for the purpose of the thanksgiving ritual, even though some of these writers could have been common worshipers.

<!--Following are two other sets of classification for these types of psalms. There is no agreement among scholars about which psalms fit in this category.
Individual: 30, 34, 41, 66, 92, 116, 118, 138 and national: 67, 75, 107, 124, 129, 136 (Psalms: A Guide to Studying the Psalter By W. H. Jr. Bellinger, p. 108)
Individual: Psalms 18, 30, 31, 32, 40, 66, 92, 116, 118, and 120 (Encountering the Book of Psalms (Encountering Biblical Studies): A Literary and Theological Introduction By C. Hassell Bullock, p. 384)-->
<!--Mays has pointed out that the cycle of trouble-prayer-help is not complete without “specific and public acts of gratitude.” Gratitude is a spiritual virtue that opens the door of the soul to the world around us. It creates a centrifugal force that causes the individual to look away from the self to God and to fellow human beings. It is not self-generating but stems from something outside oneself.
