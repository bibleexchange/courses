## More Advice for "Living Under the Sun" (vs.1-9)

### Ecclessiastes 8:1-4 (Wisdom in Obeying and Honoring the King)

> 1 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed. 2 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God. 3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

#### 1. Who is like a wise man? 

Qoholet searched for a wise man, who knew the interpretation of a thing. Qoholet knew that wisdom makes a man happier, even in an under the sun premise (makes his face shine ... the sternness of his face is changed).

"The shining face generally speaks of favour. Here it speaks of the wise man who is visibly gracious in his demeanour, and (as the next phrase says) whose gentleness is obvious in his facial expression." (Eaton)

> Numbers 6:25 &mdash; The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:

#### 2. Keep the king's commandment for the sake of your oath to God.

The Preacher understood what the Apostle Paul would later write in Romans 13, that we should obey government authority as part of our obedience to God.

Primarily, we honor government authority for the sake of our oath to God. We do it as part of our obedience to God.

> "You have sworn obedience to him; keep your oath, for the engagement was made in the presence of God. It appears that the Jewish princes and chiefs took an oath of fidelity to their kings. This appears to have been done to David, 2 Samuel 5:1-3; to Joash, 2 Kings 11:17; and to Solomon, 1 Chronicles 29:24." (Clarke)

We can agree with Qoholet's advice here, from both an Old Testament and New Testament perspective. Yet one must say that it sounds self-serving if Qoholet was Solomon, who was a king himself.

We also recognize that we are always to obey God rather than man if the two contradict (Acts 4:19). "Many passages in the Old Testament witness to the limits which loyalty to God must set on courtly tact and submissiveness." (Kidner)

> JOHN CHRYSOSTOM &mdash; One of the most gifted speakers in church history was John Chrysostom. John was sent from Antioch to what was then Constantinople where he preached fearlessly in the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. His denunciation of the lavish extravagance of the rich and ruling class and his condemnation of excess infuriated many, including Empress Eudoxia who arranged for him to be exiled. When he was told of his fate, Chrysostom responded: “What can I fear? Will it be death? But you know that Christ is my life, and that I shall gain by death. Will it be exile? But the earth and all its fullness is the Lord’s. Will it be the loss of wealth? But we brought nothing into the world, and can carry nothing out. Thus all the terrors of the world are contemptible in my eyes, and I smile at all its good things. Poverty I do not fear. Riches I do not sigh for. Death I do not shrink from.”

#### Where the word of a king is, there is power; and who may say to him, "What are you doing?" 
This is a reason why it is wise to obey a king. Their power - though sometimes held unrighteously - makes it unwise to fail to keep the king's commandment or show him respect.

This also makes us reflect on our obedience to God as the Great King. 

> "If he be a King, then it is a solemn hazard to your soul if you come short of the least of his commandments. Remember that one treason makes a traitor; one leak sinks a ship; one fly spoils the whole box of ointment. He that bought us with his blood deserves to be obeyed in all things with all our heart, and mind, and soul, and strength." (Spurgeon)

### Ecclesiastes 8:5-9 (Reasons for Wise Living)

#### 1. He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful: Good will come to those who obey and honor the king.

#### 2. Because for every matter there is a time and judgment: Wisdom knows what Qoholet first poetically explained in Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 - that there is a time and purpose for everything under heaven.

#### 3. Though the misery of man increases greatly. For he does not know what will happen.

The Preacher understood that for every matter there is a time and judgment; but he also knew that we don't know what those times are. A wise man's heart may discern both time and judgment, but certainly not perfectly; and not all are wise.

> "The highest wisdom is submission to things as they are ... Yet in doing all this there will abide in the heart the recognition of abounding injustice." (Morgan)

#### 4. No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit, and no one has power in the day of death

If the lack of wisdom discouraged Qoholet in Ecclesiastes 8:6-7, he found the powerlessness of man in the face of death to be yet more despairing. Under the sun, he saw that death allows no winners, and there is no release from that war.

#### 5. All this I have seen ... there is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt

The Preacher knew that part of man's misery on this earth was to be ruled by others oppressively.

> "This may be spoken of rulers generally, who, instead of feeding, fleece the flock; tyrants and oppressors, who come to an untimely end by their mismanagement of the offices of the state. All these things relate to Asiatic despots, and have ever been more applicable to them than to any other sovereigns in the world. They were despotic; they still are so." (Adam Clarke)

## B. Even Wisdom Doesn't Answer the Big Questions. (vs. 10-17)

### Ecclesiastes 8:10-13 (Why are the deeds of the wicked soon forgotten?)

a. I saw the wicked buried … they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: Qoholet saw that the wicked die, and their evil is soon forgotten instead of being memorialized in infamy. With his under the sun premise, Qoholet despaired that the wicked dead are not punished after death.

i. "I have seen wicked men buried and as their friends returned from the cemetery, having forgotten all the dead man's evil deeds, these men were praised in the very city where they had committed their crimes!" (Living Bible)

b. Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men us fully set in them to do evil: If wicked men are often not punished after death, they also are often not punished in this life. All this added to the sense of life's meaninglessness for Qoholet.

i. This also speaks of the hardened response many make to the mercy and forbearance of God toward them. "Man's godless ingratitude is as deep a mystery as is God's loving patience. It is strange that, with such constant failure of His love to win, God should still persevere in it." (Maclaren)

c. I surely know that it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him. But it will not be well with the wicked: In context, we can suppose that the Preacher said this as a hope or a wish, rather than with real confidence. He wishes this were true, but cannot have confidence that it is while clinging to his under the sun premise.

### Ecclesiastes 8:14 (Why do the bad have it good and the good have it bad?)

a. There are just men to whom it happens according to the wicked: Qoholet, speaking from his eternity-excluding viewpoint, felt this made life meaningless (vanity). Why do good men and women suffer?

i. This was the great question of the Book of Job, and almost unanswerable apart from a life that appreciates eternity and our accountability in the world beyond.

b. Again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous: Perhaps even more of a problem to the Preacher was the question, "Why do wicked men seem to be blessed?" The strength of this question also made life seem meaningless (vanity).

i. One might say that this question is even more troublesome, because in a very real sense, there are no just men and all can be seen as wicked in some way. Why goodness is shown to the undeserving is a question that looks to the remarkable mercy of God.

### Ecclesiastes 8:15-17 (Live for the moment - and know there is more than what you can see.)

#### 1. So I commended enjoyment: 

With the meaninglessness of life so plain to the Preacher, all he could counsel was to make the best of a bad situation and enjoy life the best way possible.

#### 2. Then I saw all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: 

Here Qoholet begins to undermine his once-so-certain premise of life lived without an eternal perspective. He recognizes that man cannot find out the work of God in fullness; so what we see does not define what there actually is.

> The business that is done on earth, even though one sees no sleep day or night: "The very busyness of life worries us into asking where it is taking us, and what it means, if it does mean anything. We hardly need Qoheleth to point out that this is the very question that defeats us." (Kidner)

> He will not be able to find it: "His conclusion is that we must be content not to know everything. Neither hard work (toil), persistent endeavour (seeking), skill or experience (wisdom) will unravel the mystery. Wise men may make excessive claims; they too will be baffled." (Eaton)
