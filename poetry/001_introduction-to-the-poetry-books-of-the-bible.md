We need to follow instructions, and follow them very careful. 

Poetry covers from Job to the Song of Solomon. (Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon)

There will be memory scriptures, study questions, quizzes. 

Before the end of the year every student will be required to write a Psalm, from scratch.
