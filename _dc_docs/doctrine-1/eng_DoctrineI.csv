This study is also commonly called theology&#44; which means literally <i>a reasoned discourse about God</i>. Theology or doctrine may be defined as <i>a science which deals with our knowledge of God and His relations with man</i>. ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Tamko &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo; maona yake mafundisho, na tena imeweza kufasiriwa kama kweli ya ndani katika biblia yenye kutungwa katika utaratibu ya mbinu mafunzo hiyi imcitwa kwa ujumba &ldquo;theology&rdquo;, maana maarifa kamili kuhusu Mungu. Theology ao doctrine lime weza kufasiriwa kama maarifa kuhusu ufahamu wetu wa Mungu na kwambatana kwake Mungu na mtu. ",</span>,</p> <ul>

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Science is the systematic and logical arrangement of certified facts. <u>We describe theology/doctrine as a science because it consists of facts relating to God and Divine things arranged in a systematic and logical order.</u> ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Maarifa ni utaratibu kamili na yenye kitungwaa mbinyay yene kuhakikishwa, mambo.

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Theology is knowledge of God&#44; but religion is the practice of what is known. (John 13:17; James 1:27) You can be a theologian and not at all religious &mdash; i.e.&#44; not having any genuine spiritual experience. ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Theology ni ufahamu kuhusu Mungu, walakini, dini ni mazoezo za hiyo ambayo imefahamika. (John 13:17; james 1:27). Umeweza kuwa mwenye maarifa kamili kuhusu Mungu (theologian), lakini bado haujaambatana na dini-yani, badon haujapata ufahamu kamili za viroho. ",</span>,</p> <ul> 
<li>,"<span lang=""en"">",<b> What is the difference between a doctrine and a dogma? </b>,"</span><span lang=""swa"">",<b>Tofauti gain inayopatikana kati ya doctrine na dogma. </b>,</span>,</li> </ul> 
<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Dogma is man’s statement of the truth set forth in a creed; while&#44; doctrine is the fundamental truths of the Bible arranged in a systematic form. EXAMPLE: The Roman Catholic Church instructs men to call the pope <i>Holy Father</i> (dogma)&#44; whereas the Bible says in Matthew 23:9 &ldquo;<i>call no man your father&rdquo;. </i>(doctrine). The very context of Christ’s command is addressing the pride and arrogance of men that usurp honor and recognition that is not their own to claim. &ldquo;Our source is not in man&#44; but is in God&rdquo; is the doctrine Christ is emphasizing. The false doctrine that prefaces this particular dogma is that the pope is literally Christ on the earth. Pope Pius X (1903-1914) is quoted in a sermon on the authority of the pope: ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Dogma ni maneno ya kweli kutokea kwa mtu yenye kudhihirishwa kwa namna ya kusadiki, bali doctrine ni kweli wa ndani katika bibkia wenye kutungwa kwa ambinu. Kwa Mfano: kanisa ya katolika ya Rumi imeagiza watu kumwita pape &ldquo;Baba Mtakatifu&rdquo; (dogma), bali biblia imesema katika injili ya Mathayo Mtakaatifu sura yake ishirini na tatu, shairi ya tisa: Msimwite mtu Baba duniani. (doctrine). Maana kamili ya mafundisho ya kristo ni kuhusu kiburi na majivu ya watu ambaye wamepotonya ustahivu na shukrani isiyo kuwa ya kwao kwa kujipendelea wenyewe. Mwanza wetu siyo kwa mtu, bali kwa Mungu kwenye na fundisho ambayo Kristo ametetea. Mafundisho danganifu imetoa hiyo dogma kwamba Pape ndiye Kristo duniani. Pope Pius (ambae ali kuwako toka mwaka 1903 hadi 1914) aliiga kusema katika mafundisho kuhusu mamlakon ya Pope: ",</span>,</p> 
<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",<i> The Pope is not simply the representative of Jesus Christ. On the contrary&#44; he is Jesus Christ Himself&#44; under the veil of the flesh&#44; and who by means of a being common to humanity continues His ministry amongst men ... Does the Pope speak? It is Jesus Christ Who is speaking. Does he teach? It is Jesus Christ Who teaches. Does he confer grace or pronounce an anathema? It is Jesus Christ Himself Who is pronouncing the anathema and conferring the grace. </i> <i> </i> ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","<i>Pope siye tu msimamizi wa Yesu Kristu. Lakini, ni Yesu Kristo mwenyewe, Katika mwili na kwa kuwa mtu kama watu ame fuliza kubimiza kazi zake myongoni mwa watu… </i><i>Pope amesema ? Ndiye Yesu Kristo amenena. Amefundisha ? Ndiye Yesu Kristo amefundisha. Ametoa neema ao laana? Ndiye Yesu Kristo mwenyewe ametoa laana na neema. </i>",</span>,</p> 
<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",The <i>dogma</i> of the Roman Catholic church is based on <i>false doctrine</i> and therefore it is false. Doctrine could be understood as &ldquo;simply what the Bible says&rdquo; and dogma is man’s conclusions drawn from the text of the Scripture. Dogma <i>can be</i> true&#44; but is not necessarily true. ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Dogma ya kanisa za katolika ya Rumi umeketi juu ya mafundisho danganifu, na kumbe, imekuwa ya uongo. Mafundisho imesema &ldquo;na dogma kama neon la mwisho kutokea kwa mtu na yenye kupatikana katika maandikon takatifu. Dogma imeweza kwa kweli, balihaiwezi kwa mara yote kuwa kweli. ",</span>,</p>

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",<i>Authoritative </i>statements are so important that we may be able to <i>convince the gainsayers</i>(Titus 1:9). Doctrinal knowledge also helps the Believer understand at least three things: 1) Who we are (sinners/saints/loved/judged&#44; etc.)&#44; 2) where we came from (dust&#44; image of God&#44; etc.) and 3) where we are headed (heaven&#44; hell&#44; blessings&#44; curses&#44; etc.).,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","<i>Maneno ya mamlaka </i>ni ya muhimu kwa kuwashinda wenye kupinga.

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Every experience we enjoy with God is dependent on faith. (Faith is not a shot in the dark&#44; but is securely founded on the WORD OF GOD. Romans 10:17) Paul asks a significant question that establishes our point in verse 14 of Romans 10&#44; &ldquo;<i>how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?&rdquo;</i>CORRECT doctrinal knowledge is essential&#44; because it is not sufficient to just believe in <i>something</i>&#44; but we must possess that which is TRUTH. God does not respond to <i>hope-so’s</i>&#44; or <i>I’ve been told that…</i>&#44; but God does respond to <b>faith</b>in His Word. ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Kila ufahamu tunayo ya mungu imetegemea imani (Imani chanzo chake nikusikia, na kusikia huja kwa NENO LA MUNGU. Warumi 10:17). Paulo mtume ameuliza swali moja yenyi maana na yenyi kuhudhuru nukta yetu kwenye shauri 14 ya warumi 10 &ldquo;Basi wamwiteje yeye wasiyemwamini?&rdquo;.

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",EXAMPLE: Acts 17:22-34. The people of Athens had erected an altar with the inscription &ldquo;To the Unknown God.&rdquo; Paul declared on Mars Hill that this Unknown God whom they ignorantly worshipped was the God who made Heaven and earth. The people of Athens had not known SALVATION through ignorant worship&#44; but those that came to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and him crucified and resurrected from the dead did absolutely experience salvation! I Timothy 4:16 infers that the if we do not <i>take heed unto the doctrine</i>than we will be lost.,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","KWA MFANO: Matendo ya mitume 17:22-34.

Paulo akasimama katikati ya Areopago, akasema, Enyi Watu wa Athen, katika mambo yote naona ya kuisa minyi ni watu wa athene walipata wokovu kwa njia ya kwabudu bila kunijua, lakini wale waliyoyapata ufahamu ya Yesu Kristo ambaye alisulubiashwa na kufifuta katika wafu hawakuyapate wokovu! I timotheo 4:16 ametetea kwamba ikiwa hautunze mafundisho yote, hatuitunze mafundisho yetu, tutapotea. ",</span>,</p>

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Perfect&#44; that is&#44; <i>full development</i>. There is progressive development in the spiritual life as there is in the physical life. There are stages of perfection. Is a baby perfect? As a baby&#44; yes! But growth must take place or we would say something is wrong. I Peter 2:2 says&#44; &ldquo;<i>As newborn babes&#44; desire the sincere milk of the word&#44; that ye may <u>grow</u>thereby</i>:&rdquo; ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Kamili, ni maendeleo timilifu.

Lakini kukomoa kumefaa kwendelea ao kama sivyo, tumesema kuna shida. I Petro 2:2 amesema, &ldquo; <i>Kama vile watoto wachanga wanavyotamani maziwa, nanyi pia mnapaswa kuwa na hamu ya maziwa halisi ya kiroho, ili kwa nguvu yake mpate kukua na kukombolewa.&rdquo;</i>",</span>,</p>
<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",It is more important to live right than to know doctrine&#44; but you will <b><u>not</u></b>live right without right Christian doctrine.

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Can you truly love Jesus without knowledge of God’s Word? An understanding of doctrine is essential to growth in Christian character. It has been well said that &ldquo;Christian character is a fruit that grows only on the tree of Christian doctrine.&rdquo; Correct doctrine is to a Christian what a man’s backbone is to his body.

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",The term ‘s<i>pecial</i>creation’ refers to the doctrine that all living organisms were created according definite ‘species’ and that these species will produce after their kind. This principle defies the evolutionary hypothesis that each species is an evolved form of some earlier species. Biblically put&#44; special creation means that all living organisms will produce <b>after his kind</b>. A very simple example of this principle is that when you plant an orange seed&#44; it is most definite that an orange tree will develop and not any other kind of plant (i.e. apples&#44; watermelons&#44; cucumber&#44; etc.). ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Tamko &ldquo;umbo wa tofauti&rdquo; imeambatana na mafundisho ya kwamba viumbe vyote vyenye uhai viliumbya kutokana na ma haina Fulani na kwamba hiyo ma haina Fulani ina hali yenye mwendeleo ya ma haina ambayo ili kuako tangu awali. Kutokana na biblia, umbo wa tofauti (upekee) maana viumbe vyote vyenye uhai vitatoa uzao kwa mfano wake. Mfano mwepesi ya hiyo kamuni ni kwamba wakati umepanda punje za njimu, (mekuwa wazi kwamba mti wa njimu zita komaa kusi haina yake tu (kwa mbfano: apples, water melons, cucumber, na kadhalika) (Ndizi, hembe, mapela, muzeituni, na kadhalika).

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Genesis 1:26 says man was created in the image of God. To what does this &ldquo;image&rdquo; and &ldquo;likeness&rdquo; refer?,"</span><span lang=""swa"">",Mwanzo 1:26 imesema kwamba aliumbwa kwa mfano wake Mungu. Ufananisho na mfano hii imeambatana na nini? ,</span>,</p>
<h4>,"<span lang=""en"">",1. There may<u>be</u>reference here to physical likeness. There are some who believe that such scriptures as Psalm 17:15 teach that God has a visible form and that man in the garden bore that image.

Kumekuwa ambatano na ujananisho wa murlikuna wengine wamedhani kwamba hiyo maandiko, kama Zaburi 17:15 zimefundisha kwamba ana hali yenye kuonekana, hivyo mtu kwenye bustani alichukua kwa mfano wake. Angalia tena katika Isaya 6:1 na Matendo 7:55,56.",</span>,</h4>
<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",However&#44; we must be careful to remember that while God is capable of assuming human form<b>&#44; the essence of His being is Spirit.</b>(John 4:24) ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">"," Basi, afadhali ma tufanye angalisho ili kukumbuka kwamba Mungu ana uwezon ya kuivaa hali ya mtu.

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Opposed to special creation is the theory of evolution&#44; which teaches that all forms of life developed from one form and that higher species&#44; developed from a lower. So that&#44; for example&#44; what was once a snail became a fish; what was once a fish became a reptile; what was once a reptile became a bird&#44; and what was once an ape became a human being.,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Kinyume za umbo za tofauti ni mafundisho za maendeleo, ambayo imefundisha halizote za maisha yenye kupata maendeleo tangu hali moja na hiyo na haina ya hali za juu zaidi, yenye kupata maendeleo kutoka kwa ma traina za chini zoudi. Ili kusudi, kwa mfano, ile iliyo kuwa gorogoro ili kwa samaki; ile iliyokuwa samaki, ilikuwa wanyama wenye kutamboa; ile iliyokuwa wanyama wenye kutamboa ilikuwa ndege, ne ile iliyokuwa apepe ili kuwa mtu.

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Grace has been called &ldquo;pure unrecompensed kindness and favor&rdquo; <i>or</i>&ldquo;Unmerited favor.&rdquo; Grace cannot incur debt. What God bestows&#44; He bestows as a gift; we cannot pay for it. (Rom. 6:23) Christian service is not the payment for God’s grace; service is the Christians way to express devotion and love to God. &ldquo;We love Him because He first loved us.&rdquo; (I John 4:19),"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Neema iliitwa &ldquo;wema na fadhilisafi bila thsawabu&rdquo; ao &ldquo; fadhili ambao haistailiwe&rdquo;. Neema haiwegi kukopa deni. Ile Mungu ametoa, ameyatowa kama karama; hatuwezi kulipa kwa ajili ya hiyo. (warumi 6:23) Kazi ya kikristo siyo malipo kwa ajili ya neema la Mungu; Kazi ni njia ya kikristo ya kuonyesha utauwa na upendo kwa Mungu &ldquo;Tumemupenda, kwani yeye alitupenda mbele (Iyohana 4:19).

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",A misunderstanding should be avoided. Grace does not mean that sin is forgiven because God is big-hearted enough to remit the penalty. Redemption is through the blood. (Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:6-7) Pardoning sin is based on <u>strict justice</u>. In pardoning sin &ldquo;He is faithful and just&rdquo; ( I John 1:9) We are justified only because Christ PAID the debt.,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Kutokuelewa kumestaili kuepukika. Neema maana yake siyo kusamehewa dhambi, kwa sababu Mungu ni mwenye moyo mkuu kwa kusamehe adhabu. Wokobu ni kwa njia ya damu (warumi 3:24; waefeso 1:6-7). Kusamehe dhambi imeketi juu ya haki ngumu.

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",Justification is by faith. Since the law cannot justify&#44; man’s only hope is for a &ldquo;righteousness without the law&rdquo; (Rom. 3:21). This is not an unlawful unrighteousness&#44; or a religion that permits us to sin&#44; but is justification that changes our position with God based on the merits of Christ. This is the &ldquo;righteousness of God&rdquo; (a righteousness which God imparts)&#44; and it is a gift because man lacks the power to develop it or work it out. (Eph. 2:8-10) The three operations of faith are as follows:,"</span><span lang=""swa"">","Kuhesabuliwa kuwahaki ni kwa imani. Kwa sababu sheria haiwezi kuhesabu kuwa haki, taraja tu ya mtu ni &ldquo;Haki bila shema&rdquo; (warumi 3:21).

Hiyo ndiyo &ldquo;Haki ya Mungu&rdquo; (Haki ambao Mungu ametolea), na imekuwa kipawa kwa sababu mtu amekosa mamlaka ya kuikomalisha ao kuitimiza. (waefeso 2:8-10).

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",<strong>Answer: </strong>The Bible is clear that all people are God’s creation ( Colossians 1:16 )&#44; and that God loves the entire world ( John 3:16 )&#44; but only those who are born again are children of God ( John 1:12 ; 11:52 ; Romans 8:16 ; 1 John 3:1-10 ). ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">",,</span>,</p>

<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",The LDS church teaches a unique belief that answers this poignant question &mdash; are all children of a Heavenly Father who loves us. Our Father in Heaven created our spirits&#44; and we lived with him in a premortal world. Our existence on this world was not an accident or improvisation. He created the Earth specifically for us. We chose to be sent here&#44; to receive our physical bodies&#44; and to be tested preparatory for us receiving all that God has planned for us according to our faithfulness. ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">",,</span>,</p>
<p>,"<span lang=""en"">",While we are all the spirit offspring of God the Father&#44; and therefore the spiritual brothers and sisters to Jesus Christ (who was chosen from before the foundation of the world to be our Savior)&#44; Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten&#44; Flesh and Bone Son of God. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer&#44; who set the way for us to return to the presence of Our Father in Heaven. Only a family member would love us enough to offer himself as a sacrifice for justice and mercy. ,"</span><span lang=""swa"">",,</span>,</p>
