<h1>Chapter 9: The Ministry of an Apostle</h1>
<p>In the next few chapters of this book we will be looking at the separate ministries of the apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. We will be looking at them in the order given in Ephesians 4:11 not because this is necessarily their order of importance, but simply because this is the order in which the key verse mentions them.</p>
<p>The first task to complete in considering the ministry of an apostle is to decide upon a definition of an apostle. An apostle is one sent forth as a messenger, with a commission, under the authority of one doing the sending. This defers from the definition of a disciple since a disciple is a follower who follows with the intent of learning and putting what is learned into practice. All true Christians are disciples (including those who apostles).</p>
<p>In relation to the Christian faith, an apostle is one called out from among the disciples and sent forth as seen in Luke 6:13 &quot;and when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles&quot;. With these thoughts behind us, we will now look at New Testament Scriptures pertaining to the ministry of an apostle. In doing so we will observe the different examples of apostles. </p>
<p>The first example of an apostle is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself. Truly, he is our example in all matters pertaining to the Christian faith and ministry. In Hebrews 3:1 he is spoken of as: &quot;the Apostle and High Priest of our profession.&quot; These titles speak to us of his relationship to God and his ministry to man. He was definitely one sent forth with a Divine Commission. Thank God that he was not only &quot;sent forth&quot;, but that he was obedient to the end to carry out the fathers will. This is clearly illustrated in Christ&apos;s own words in John 17:3-8.</p>
<p>The next example of the ministry of the apostle is the calling and work of the original twelve as listed in Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:14-19, Luke 6:13-16. The original twelve apostles as well as all succeeding apostles were chosen from those who were already disciples.</p>
<p>As with any of the fivefold ministry, all apostles are personally chosen by the Lord Jesus Himself. It is not within the authority or choice of men to appoint apostles nor to appoint any of the others of the fivefold ministry. The most that man can do is confim those that God has chosen.</p>
<p>One important factor I would like us to notice in this all important decision of Jesus in choosing the twelve is that he spent the previous night in prayer (Luke 6:12). This within itself tells us that the Lord takes great care in His choice of leaders for his work.. IT should also speak to us of the necessity of, saturating major decisions with much prayer to God before coming to a final conclusion. This is also true in the practice of laying hands upon those to be set apart for the service of God in any special ministry.</p>
<p>The original twelve apostles (possibly with the exclusion of Judas Iscariot) were to have a place of permanence throughout the ages&mdash;along with the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel (Revelation 21:14). This in itself should cause us to move prayerfully as we work for God, for how much of what we are doing is of eternal value</p>
<p>The third category of apostle mentioned in the New Testament is the false apostle. Satan is not going to waste time, talent, and labor copying anything that is not genuine. Thus, when I see one of counterfeits around I know that there must also be the authentic, &quot;Real&quot; ministry being copied. This is also true of prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. God has the genuine and Satan has the counterfeit or false. Don&apos;t be disillusioned by the false but be encourage that the real is genuine enough for Satan to be willing to expand the effort to copy it.</p>
<p>There was on apostle who seems to have had a special call to establish the church among the Gentiles. This, of course, is none other than Paul, who was previously known as Saul of Tarsus (Romans 11:13, Acts 9:15). He speaks of Himself over twenty times as an apostle. He was the first man recorded to make any systematic effort to evangelize the Gentiles. Some have reason to believe that he is the Divine replacement of Judas Iscariot rather than the Matthias of Acts 1:26.</p>
<p>The ministry of an apostle is to be a continuing ministry throughout the Church Age. God gave this ministry, along with the other four, as a gift to the church to bring her to perfection. It is impossible to imagine that the ministry of an apostle could be discontinued before the church is brought to perfection, at the end of this Church Age. We still need every gift that God has given to the church. When the church has come to perfection, it will be presented to Christ without spot or wrinkle or any such thing (Ephesians 5:27). He is coming for a perfect bride. I, for one, feel the need for every provision he has made to bring me to perfection. Because certain fragments of the church have failed to recognize and utilize all the gifts and ministries that Christ provided her, they are in the poor condition they are in today.</p>
<p>There are various references in the New Testament to apostiles, other tha n Paul or the twelve as discusses previously. There were apostles with Paul in Iconium as well as in other places of miniustry (Acts 14:4; Romans 16:7; Galatians 1:19; I Thessalonians 1:1, 2:6). We find the word &quot;Apostle&quot; possibly applies to about twenty-five persons in the New Testament since it is also sometimes translated &quot;Messenger&quot;. Titus seems to have fit into this category since he was one who was establishing churches and setting things in order within the local churches (Titus 1:5).</p>
<p>Next, we will examine the ministry of the New Testament apostle. In any study of this nature, there are some questions that we must ask ourselves. First, who sent the apostles mentioned in the New Testament? Second, where were they sent? Third, what was the commission of these men?</p>
<p>In answering these questions we will begin with the original twelve. They were called, trained and sent by Christ Himself. They were sent to the worldwide church. This mission continues, even to the end of the Church Age, via their ministry of laying down the foundational truths for the entire Church Age. Paul wrote, in Ephesians 2:20: &quot;And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.&quot;</p>
<p>The ministry of the original twelve apostles seems to go even beyond the Church Age and into eternity (Revelation 21:14). Their writings were inspired and preserved as &quot;Gospel&quot;. They were truly a young church and a means of nurturing her to maturity. They set forth the early structure of the church, outlined the qualifications for the ministering body and took the initiative to see that proper leadership was set in place. They baptized converts, preached the gospel, taught doctrine, etc.</p>
<p>The ministry of apostle is an ongoing ministry for the church of all ages. The ministry of an apostle today is similar to that of the twelve. A modern day apostle must be chosen, trained, and sent by Christ just as the original twelve were. Ther are to ground the church in the truth that has already been laid down so that the church will not be blown about with every wind of doctrine. The twelve laid down the &quot;Foundational Truths&quot; which the apostles of today are to minister.</p>
<p>The vision of today&apos;s apostles goes beyond one local assembly since they are sent to the church at large. Their ministry will expand as pastors recognize the call of God upon their lives and call upon them for assistance. A man will never have to push his way to the front, &quot;(his) ministry will make room for itself&quot; (Proverbs 18:16). The ministry of the modern day apostle will be one of seeking to preserve unity and cooperation within and among local assemblies. We see this spirit vividly in the ministry of Paul, in his striving to write to those who are divisive, as in the church of Corinth.</p>
<p>Apostles are also to be concerned with the ministries of individuals. They will endeavor to nurture promising young men into their ministries, sometimes by taking them under their wing for a season of training. They will also, at times, as the Spirit leads, function via the gifts of the Spirit in confirming God&apos;s call upon specific members of the local assemblies.</p>
<p>The present day apostle may also be active in establishing new churches and setting the new churches in order, returning to them on occasion to nurture and strengthen them in their faith. We have not only the example of Paul and Barnabas but also of many modern missionaries who function along this line. It is possible these brethren are considered apostles in the eyes of the Lord.</p>
<p>It would not be correct to include all missionaries in this category since many serve as clerks, doctors, mechanics, pilots, etc. in the mission field. However, some are true apostles as well as prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. The ministry and works that follow a man will be proof of his calling. This is not true only for apostles. It is equally true for those who are called to other ministries (I Corinthians 9:2).</p>
