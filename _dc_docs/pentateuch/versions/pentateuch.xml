<text id='20' class='p'><eng>The word &quot;testament&quot; means &quot;will&quot; or &quot;covenant.&quot; The term &quot;Old Testament&quot;&#44; therefore&#44; refers to God&apos;s covenant or promise-law to bless mankind through the Jewish nation.

<text id='68' class='p'><eng>The five books of the Law (Jewish name: Torah) are also called &quot;the Pentateuch&quot;(a Greek name) which means &quot;five scrolls.&quot; At least some of this literature if not all was written by Moses (Luke 24:27; John 5:46). These books describe the creation of the world&#44; God&quot;s call to the Hebrews to be His special people&#44;their captivity and release from Egypt&#44; the laws which guided them on their way to the Promised Land and how God blessed the people when they obeyed and disciplined them when they disobeyed.</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='90' class='h2'><eng>See the Whole Picture of the Bible</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='91' class='p'><eng>A superficial reading of the Bible shows it to be a collection of sixty-six books written during a period of about 1600 years by about forty different authors&#44; among who were kings&#44; prophets&#44; priests&#44; a shepherd&#44; and fishermen. It appears to be a library rather than one book. A closer look at the Bible reveals it to be a unified work.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='92' class='p'><eng>Through the many stories and varied subject matter of the Scriptures runs one outstanding and predominant theme--the Redemption of mankind through a Divinely appointed Savior (and this is evidence to the fact that all the authors were under the direction of oneAuthor--The Holy Ghost.) This unity of the Scriptures is a stark contrast compared to the Islamic Koran&#44; which consists of a collection of 114 unrelated chapters organized according to their length (with the exception of Sura i.).</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='93' class='p'><eng>The story of Redemption is a dramatic story&#44; and not dead&#44; boring&#44; hastily combined pieces of literature. uThePentateuch sets the scene and palette for the entire picture of Biblical revelation.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='94' class='p'><eng>(Gen. 3:15; 6:18; Ex.12:13; Lev. 1:5; Num. 19:1-10; Deut. 1:8; uLuke 24:27)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='95' class='h2'><eng>General Details of the Pentateuch</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='96' class='h3'><eng>Pentateuch means &quot;5 Scrolls&quot; and is the Greek name given to the first five books of the Bible by the translators. These 5 books are known by the Jews as &quot;The Torah&quot; which means TheLaw. The Pentateuch is part of the Old Testament. &quot;Testament&quot; means will or covenant. This covenant was one of shadows and promises of better things to come. (Hebrews 8:6-13)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='97' class='bq'><eng>Hebrews 12:24--And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant&#44; and to the blood of sprinkling&#44; that speaketh better things than that of Abel.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='98' class='h3'><eng>At least some of the Pentateuch if not all was written by Moses and the Pentateuch is without question Divinely inspired Scripture. The Pentateuch&quot;s authenticity<a href='#2547' >[1]</a> is attested by the most indisputable evidence&#44; and it is cited as an inspired record thirty-three times in the course of the Scriptures. <a href='#2547' >[2]</a></eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='99' class='h2'><eng>A Description of each book of the Pentateuch</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='100' class='p'><eng>GENESIS is the book of origins--of the beginning of life&#44; and of ruin through sin. Its first phrase &quot;in the beginning God created&quot; is in striking contrast to its last phrase &quot;in a coffin in Egypt.&quot;</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='101' class='p'><eng>EXODUS is the book of Redemption--the first need of a ruined race.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='102' class='p'><eng>LEVITICUS is the book of worship and communion&#44; which is the proper exercise of the redeemed.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='103' class='p'><eng>NUMBERS speaks of the experiences of a pilgrim people passing through a hostile scene to a promised inheritance.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='104' class='p'><eng>DEUTERONOMY is retrospective and prospective. It is a book of instruction for the redeemed about to enter into their inheritance. (Retrospective -- relating to things of the past. Prospective -- relating to things of the future.) &quot;Remember&quot;is the key word.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='105' class='h2'><eng>Authorship of the Pentateuch</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='106' class='p'><eng>The author of the Pentateuch is nowhere designated in the collection itself. The testimony of the Bible&#44;however&#44; is that Moses was the author of the majority of the Pentateuch.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='107' class='h3'><eng>Passages Confirming this Conclusion </eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='114' class='h2'><eng>Depth of the Pentateuch</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='115' class='p'><eng>The Pentateuch is not merely a record of happenings&#44; but in thePentateuch we have a true and logical introduction to the entire Bible&#44; and an epitome<a href='#2547' >[4]</a>of the Divine revelation. The Pentateuch introduces in their embryonic stage such doctrines as:</eng><swa></swa></text><div class='ul'>
<text id='116' class='li'><eng>The Nature of God. God is the Source of all Things (Gen. 1:1)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='117' class='li'><eng>The Nature of Man. Man is Sinful (Gen.3:6; 4:8)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='118' class='li'><eng>The Nature of Satan. Satan is a Liar (Gen.3:4)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='119' class='li'><eng>The Nature of Sin. Sin brings Death (Gen.2:17)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='120' class='li'><eng>The Nature of Salvation Salvation through theCross (Num. 21:4-9)</eng><swa></swa></text></div>
<text id='121' class='h2'><eng>Historical Precedence</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='122' class='p'><eng>Babylonian and Assyrian monuments contain records bearing a grotesque resemblance to the majestic account ofCreation and of The Flood. Dennis Bratcher of CRI has observed&#44; &quot;...there aresimply too many similarities between the accounts to deny any relationship between the accounts.&quot; This fact confirms rather than invalidates Divine inspiration of the Mosaic account. Some tradition of creation and the Flood would inevitably be handed down in the ancient cradle of the human race. Such tradition&#44; following the order of all tradition&#44; would take on grotesque and mythological features over time&#44; and these abound in the Babylonianrecords.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='123' class='p'><eng>An example of such a tradition that has survived the ages is the uEnuma Elish (&quot;When on High&quot;). The uEnumaElish is seven Babylonian clay tablets uncovered in Nineveh (Mosul&#44; Iraq)by Henry Layard in 1849. The uEnuma Elish has about a thousand lines and is recorded in Old Babylonian on seven clay tablets&#44; each holding between 115and 170 lines of text. The tablets give us a good look at the Babylonian world view centered on their patron false god&#44; Marduk. These tablets date back to 7th or 8th century BC but the story contained in it may date as far back as the 12th or even the 14th century BC.</eng><swa></swa></text><div class='table' id='creation-enumaElish'><div class='tr'>

<text id='147' class='p'><eng>It is possible these tablets are older than any copies of Scripture that we have&#44; but this does not mean they are a more reliable record just because they are older. Of necessity&#44; the first task of inspiration would be to supplant the often absurd and childish traditions of men with a revelation of the true history (thePentateuch)&#44; and such history we find in words of matchless grandeur&#44; and in an order which&#44; rightly understood&#44; is absolutely scientific.</eng><swa></swa></text></div>

<text id='310' class='p'><eng>The Bible never attempts to prove the existence of God&#44; but merely acceptsHis eternal existence as a foregone conclusion. God is eternally existent and preceded all matter and persons. (Deut. 32:40; 33:27; Job 36:26; Psalm 9:7;Isa. 57:15; Rev. 1:8)</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='312' class='p'><eng>The foundation of Christianity is faith. In the fullness of time&#44; this faith can be confirmed by observable facts. Although filled with scientifically accurate material&#44; the intent of Scripture is not to give a world history or ascientific exegesis of all things natural. Only the first two chapters aredevoted to a synopsis of creation and it promptly proceeds to the maincourse--God&quot;s dealings with man and specifically&#44; the Hebrew people. All thebooks of the Old Testament concern themselves with this thought.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='313' class='p'><eng>As both Creationism and Evolution require faith&#44; It would seem the only necessity for the idea of evolution is to create a situation where man can be independent of God and free to establish his own rules of life. Evolution is the  religion of the atheist. To believe in the religion of evolution is to beanti-God in that it is in stark contrast to the record of Scripture&#44; God&quot;s HolyWord.</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='343' class='p'><eng>The sequential differences of the creative events recorded in chapters one and two have been the topic of much criticism. In chapter one&#44; the purpose of the writer is to give a brief summary of the highlights of creation.

<text id='374' class='p'><eng>Evolution is not a science&#44; however&#44; but is more of a religion that requires faith. As a theory&#44; it postulates for millions of transitional species that have never been seen. It does not even attempt to answer the question of origin&#44; but makesastronomically sized assumptions and moves from there. The only variations of species to be scientifically observed have been a)harmful and detrimental b)only differences within the species and not the development of new species altogether. </eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='377' class='p'><eng>Although God&apos;s existence is a foregone conclusion&#44; the nature of God is extensively detailed in Scripture. All that Christians know and doctrinally claim concerning God is revealed in the pages of the Bible. In the Hebrew Old Testament&#44; there are manynames<a href='#2547' >[9]</a> or titles referring to God&#44; and each is uniquely descriptive. Much of the nature of God can be understood by a look at these names.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='378' class='p'><eng>Jehovah (YVWH) -- the Covenant Name of God--is the most popular and widely used. It is used in conjunction with different words establishing the correlation of God&apos;s promises and God&apos;s name. (Heb. 6:13; 15:3; Ps 83:18; Mark 13:31; Ps. 138:2)The use of Jehovah is signaled in the KJV by the use of all capital letters: LORD.</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='502' class='h3'><eng>The name Adam means earthy; red</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='503' class='p'><eng>Earthy-- The Lord formed man out of the dust of the earth. (Gen. 2:7; 3:9; 18:27) Without God man is just dirt.It was not until God breathed into man the breath of His life that man became aliving soul. We are formed from the ground&#44; but God is the sourceof all ulife. In this lesson we see clearly the futility of humanitywithout God.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='504' class='p'><eng>Red is possibly a reference to red clay and earth&#44; but also brings our thoughts to blood. The life of the flesh is in the blood...(Lev. 17:11). More important than theblood that pumped through Adam&quot;s veins which was affected by sin is theinnocent blood of the Second Adam who would come and destroy the powerof the serpent. (Gen. 3:15)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='505' class='h3'><eng>Placed in the Garden of Eden and commanded to dress and keep it. 2:5&#44;15</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='506' class='p'><eng>Eden-- The beautiful paradise that God created was possibly situated somewhere between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted&#44; and became into four heads--Pison&#44; Gihon&#44; Hiddekel&#44;&amp; Euphrates. (Gen.2:10-14). It is important to note that the Flood may have dramatically rerouted the Euphrates River and the geographic picture we seetoday may be tremendously different from what was before the torrents of thegreat deluge.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='507' class='p'><eng>Dress and Keep-- In the garden utopia Adam was not free to lounge 247&#44; but was given great responsibility that accompanied his authority (Gen. 1:26). From this passage we may safelyconclude that labor and work was not the curse following sin&#44; but merely thesweat&#44; difficulty and futility of it. (Gen. 3:17-19) Also&#44; part of Adam&quot;sresponsibility was to keep the garden&#44; that is&#44; to protect; guard;preserve and also includes the idea of performing the part of a watchman.There was a serpent operating right under Adam&quot;s nose and he didn&quot;t even notice until it was too late. We have a great responsibility to take care of and guardthe gifts that God gives us. Let us not be slack in our duty&#44; but watchful.(I Peter 5:8) </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='508' class='h3'><eng>Adam and Eve were driven from garden. Gen. 3:22-24</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='509' class='p'><eng>The commandment was given to Adam.He was not deceived as Eve&#44; but made a wilful choice against God&apos;s command.(Gen. 2:16&#44;17; I Tim. 2:14) </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='510' class='p'><eng>It was because of his sin that they were driven from the garden and more importantly the close communion Adam enjoyed with God in the garden was lost. Sin separates man from God and bringsspiritual and physical death. Adam lived 930 years. He lived to be acontemporary of Lamech&#44; Noah&quot;s father. Although that is a long life by today&quot;sstandard&#44; death was not in God&quot;s will. Death is a result of sin</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='543' class='p'><eng>Following Adam and Eve&apos;s expulsion from Eden&#44; sin grew like leprosy on earth. In his jealousy&#44; Cain murdered his own brother. God judges Cain making him a fugitive&#44; but would not hold others guiltless in taking Cain&quot;s life (God set a mark upon Cain). The influence of sin was everywhere and growing every day. We see the degeneration of man (...every imagination of the thoughts of his [humanity] heart was only evil continually.-6:5) epitomized in &quot;Lamech I&quot; (4:18-24)&#44; a sixth generation descendant of Cain. He not only had two wives&#44; but he murdered two men.

<text id='595' class='h4'><eng>DIFFERENCES BEFORE AND AFTER THE FLOOD</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='596' class='p'><eng>Was the world different after the flood from how it was before the flood?</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='597' class='h5'><eng>CANOPY-- One possible difference in the world before the flood was water above the earth. During the second creative day the Bible says God separated the waters above the earth from the waters below the earth.Then God said to let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters&#44; and God called the expanse Heaven. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='598' class='p'><eng>This has been interpreted various ways. Some have seen this as referring to a water vapor canopy that enveloped the earth. Such a canopy would have produced a greenhouse effect keeping the climate at a moderate temperature worldwide. This would allow for rich vegetation as well as long life for the inhabitants of the earth.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='599' class='h1'><eng>RAIN CLOUDS-- A second school of thought concerning the firmament is that it may have consisted of ordinary rain clouds. This lineof thought argues against the idea of a canopy&#44; by quoting Psalm148:4-6. According to this passage&#44; the waters above were still in existencewhen the Psalmist wrote. Furthermore&#44; the psalm states that they would remainforever by the unalterable decree of God.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='600' class='h1'><eng>NO RAIN-- The Bible possibly teaches that there was no rain before the Flood (Gen. 2:5). But there went up a mist from the earth&#44;and watered the whole face of the ground.--2:6. There is no reference ofrain having fallen until the time of the deluge. The argument is essentiallyfrom the silence of the Bible&#44; for there is no definitive statement in eithercase&#44; for we merely assume that from the time of the creation no changetakes place until the Flood.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='601' class='h1'><eng>UNIFORM CLIMATE-- The climate before the Flood may have been more uniform than today&#44; that is&#44; not having the same extremes intemperature. The Bible seems to indicate that the seasons wereestablished after the flood.--Gen. 8:22. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='602' class='h1'><eng>VEGETARIANS-- Scripture possibly teaches that humankind and the animals were not meat eaters until after the Flood. This conclusion may be drawn from Genesis 1:29.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='603' class='h1'><eng>LONGEVITY-- Before the Flood&#44; the people lived much longer. This longevity created a scenario where Adam could have rehearsed thestory of the &quot;beginning&quot; directly to the ears of hisgreat-great-great-great-great-great grandson&#44; Lamech (Noah&quot;s father). The longlives of these Patriarchs definitely increase the probability of an accuraterecord of the beginning being preserved through the ages. Observation two: Adamlived long enough to witness the results of his fall in the Garden  unto eightgenerations. Observation three: The longevity of life before the flood may be attributed to possible factors: 1)The degeneration of all things that was the result of sin was not as developed until after the Flood and 2)the world beforethe flood was a much healthier environment and with a more uniform climatepossibly enhanced by the greenhouse effect of a protective canopy. </eng><swa></swa></text>

Nimrod was known by many names including &quot;Moloch.&quot; Babies were sacrificed in his honor. (Lev. 18:21; Acts 7:43) At this time&#44; we find thebeginning of confessions&#44; celibacy for priests&#44; &amp; motherinfantworship as we see in Roman Catholicism.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='730' class='p'><eng>When Nimrod was put to death&#44; the people wept. Semiramis moved quickly and took advantage of the situation.

He became the sun god&#44; Baal.(Halos)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='731' class='p'><eng>Semiramis became a goddess with many names.

He lived approximately from1996-1822 B.C. His family&#44; a branch of the descendants of Shem&#44; was settled inUr of the Chaldees&#44; beyond the Euphrates. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='736' class='p'><eng>Terah had two other sons&#44; Nahor and Haran. Haran died in Ur of the Chaldees&#44; leaving a son&#44; Lot. Sometime following Haran&quot;s death&#44; Terah took Abram&#44; with Sarai his wife and his grandsonLot&#44; and emigrated north to the city of Haran in Mesopotamia. Although the nameof his son &quot;Haran&quot; and the name of the city &quot;Haran&quot; are spelled identical inEnglish&#44; they are spelled differently in the Hebrew. Terah died while in Haran.br clear=all </eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='739' class='p'><eng>After the death of his father&#44;Abram&#44; 75-years-old&#44; with Sarai and Lot&#44; pursued the land of Canaan. It was byDivine direction and command he chose this course when he received the generalpromise that he would become the founder of a great nation in Genesis 12:1-3.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='740' class='p'><eng>He passed through the heart of the country by the great highway to Shechem. SichemShechem means &quot;the neck(between the shoulders); the place of burden.&quot; It was in Shechem where hereceived in vision from Jehovah the further revelation that this was the landwhich his descendants should inherit. Abram put his shoulder to the task andbared the responsibility of fulfilling the will of God. The Chrisitan life isnot all ease&#44; but is filled with duty and responsibility. We must take the workof God seriously and with earnestness.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='741' class='p'><eng>The next halting-place of the sojourner was on a mountain between Bethel and Ai where he built an altar. At the time&#44; the country was suffering from famine and Abram journeyed still southward to therich corn-lands of Egypt. There&#44; fearing that the great beauty of Sarai mighttempt the powerful monarch of Egypt and expose his own life to peril&#44; hearranged that Sarai should call herself his sister. Sarai was probably thedaughter of his brother Haran which made their story at best a &quot;half-truth.&quot;Sarai&quot;s beauty was reported to the king of Egypt&#44; and she was taken into the royal harem. The deception was discovered&#44; and Pharaoh with some indignation dismissed Abram from the country although with great possessions. Accompanied by tag-a-longLot&#44; Abram returned north to southern Palestine to his former encampmentbetween Bethel and Ai. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='742' class='p'><eng>Eventually&#44; Abram and Lot parted ways. The increased wealth of the two kinsmen was the ultimate cause of their separation. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='743' class='p'><eng>Genesis13:6&#44;7a--And the land was not able to bear them&#44; that they might dwell together: for their substance was great&#44; so that they could not dwell together.And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen ofLot's cattle:</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='744' class='p'><eng>Abram gave Lot the choice for a possession of land and he chose the fertile plain of the Jordan near Sodom. Abram continued his journey as a nomad in obedience to God.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='745' class='p'><eng>Genesis 13:17--Arise&#44;walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='746' class='p'><eng>While Abram had pitched his tent in the plain of Mamre (close to Hebron) where he built an altar&#44; Lot was being taken captive by Chedorlaomer king of Elam&#44; who had invaded Sodom. When news ofLot&quot;s abduction reached Abram&#44; he pursued the conquerors and utterly routed thefour kings that had defeated five other kings. God had blessed Abram with thisvictory not very far from Damascus. The captives and plunder were allrecovered&#44; and Abram was greeted on his return by the king of Sodom&#44; and byMelchizedek king of Salem&#44; priest of the Most-High God&#44; who mysteriously appears upon the scene to bless and receive from him a tenth of the spoil. The three-times-repeated promise that his descendants should become a mighty nationand possess the land in which he was a stranger was then confirmed with all thesolemnity of a religious ceremony. Abram refused even a &quot;shoe-latchet&quot; from thespoil of his victory so that none could say &quot;I have made Abram rich.&quot; Abramsecured his blessing from God in refusing every other source. All the glorybelonged to God.</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='749' class='p'><eng>Ten years had passed since he had left his father's house&#44; and the fulfilment of the promise was apparently more distant than at first. At the suggestion of Sarai&#44; who despaired of havingchildren of her own&#44; he took as his concubine Hagar. Hagar was Sarai&quot;s Egyptianmaid. Hagar bore Ishmael when Abram was 86 years old. Although Abram now had ason&#44; this was NOT the accomplishment of the Divine promise.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='750' class='p'><eng>Thirteen years elapsed&#44; during which Abram still dwelt in Hebron&#44; when the covenant was renewed&#44; and the rite of circumcision established as its sign. Here&#44; when he was 99 years old&#44; is Abram&quot;sname was changed to Abraham&#44; (meaning: father of many nations)and Sarai&quot;s name became Sarah. The promise that Sarah should have a sonwas repeated in the remarkable scene described in chapter 18. Three men stoodbefore Abraham as he sat in his tent door in the heat of the day. The patriarch&#44;with true Eastern hospitality&#44; welcomed the strangers&#44; and bade them rest and refresh themselves. The meal ended&#44; they foretold the birth of Isaac&#44; and wenton their way to Sodom. Abraham pleads with God for Sodom and through Abraham&quot;sintercession Lot and his family were saved.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='751' class='p'><eng>At length&#44; Isaac&#44; the promised son&#44; was born. Sarah was angered by the mockery of Ishmael at the &quot;great banquet&quot; which Abraham made to celebrate the weaning of his son. In Genesis21:10&#44; Sarah demanded that Ishmael and Hagar should be driven out.</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='762' class='p'><eng>For a time&#44; Abraham dwelt inBeersheba&#44; but we find him after a few years in his original residence atHebron&#44; for there Sarah died&#44; and was buried in the cave of Machpelah. Theremaining years of Abraham's life are marked by few incidents. After Isaac'smarriage with Rebekah and his removal to Lahai-roi&#44; Abraham took to wifeKeturah&#44; by whom he had six children&#44; Zimran&#44; Jokshan&#44; Medan&#44; Midian&#44; Ishbokand Shuah&#44; who became the ancestors of nomadic tribes inhabiting the countries south and south-east of Palestine. Abraham lived to see the gradual accomplishment of the promise in the birth of his grandchildren Jacob and Esau&#44;and witnessed their growth to manhood. At the goodly age of 175 he was&quot;gathered to his people&#44;&quot; and laid beside Sarah in the tomb ofMachpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael. </eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='928' class='p'><eng>Rachel was barren and very frustrated because of it. She even turned her frustration on her husband&#44; Jacoband blamed him for her barrenness. Out of their marital spat sprouted a plan inRachel&quot;s mind--they would borrow from Abraham and Sarah&quot;s idea ofsubstitutionary impregnation. This and further competitive efforts with Leahresulted in ten children for Jacob&#44; but failed to satisfy the heart of Rachelbecause the desire of her heart was to have a child of her own. Verse 22 saysthat God &quot;remembered&quot; Rachel and gave her a son. This does not infer that God forgot Rachel&#44; but emphasizes the point God recognized or was mindful of her at this ordained time. Rachel felt forgotten and worthless&#44; but God hada plan to bless her.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='929' class='p'><eng> Rachel&quot;s self-worth was wrapped upin her ability to give Jacob at least one son and she felt like a reproachbecause of her barrenness. Her testimony of victory was that God had taken awayher reproach in given her a son&#44; Joseph. Only God can take away the reproach ofsin. There is no ability in man to please God outside of the redemptive work ofChrist. No effort of the sinner can produce life&#44; but by the miracle ofsalvation is our &quot;barrenness&quot; and &quot;reproach&quot; removed! Not only did God heal herbarrenness and remove her reproach&#44; but he restored her faith. She called her son Joseph meaning may God add or increase; added because she knew theLord would add to her another son. She was right because she eventually gavebirth to Benjamin. Alas&#44; Rachel died from the difficulty of his birth.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='930' class='p'><eng>Joseph was one of the most outstanding men of the Bible because of his personal character and despiteintense difficulties overall excellence in life. Joseph was a youthful dreamer whosedreams came true even they he was initially rejected by his brethren. Hold onto the dreams God gives because they are the compass for life.

<text id='931' class='p'><eng>COAT: It was a coat of long sleeves which was the garment of a boss and not a worker.

Joseph resisted temptation and was silent amid foulaccusations and unjust punishment. Joseph the interpreter of dreams proved that&quot;prison walls do not a prisoner make.&quot; Joseph is a perfect type of Christ andof the Overcomer. Joseph manifested great wisdom&#44; brotherly love&#44; filialdevotion and utter submission to God. (Gen. 43:20; 45:8&#44;14&#44;23; 47:7.)

The introductory genealogy shows how in arelatively short time&#44; Israel and His family greatly multiplied literallyfulfilling God&quot;s promise to Abraham. The book of Exodus was probably onceconjoined as one book with Genesis and comprises a period of about one hundred and forty-five years&#44; from the death of Joseph to the construction of the tabernacle in the desert.  </eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1035' class='p'><eng>Pharaoh gifted the fertile landsand river delta of the mighty Nile River known as Goshen to Joseph&quot;sfamily.

<text id='1044' class='p'><eng>Pharaoh&quot; strategy to kill the malechildren failed utterly because the midwives chose to fear God over man. Godprotected and blessed the midwives&#44; Shiprah and Puah&#44; for their courage. &quot;Godmade them houses&#44;&quot; that is&#44; He protected them and allowed them to have manychildren themselves. Pharaoh responded to this rebellion by opening the chargeof murder to every Egyptian. It is upon this bloody and dangerous scene thatMoses made his entrance as an innocent Levite baby. This decree was probably given sometime after Aaron&quot;s birth and retracted very shortly after Moses&apos;birth.

The Scripture says that Miriam took notice thatMoses was a &quot;goodly&quot; child. A mother has ever seen an ugly baby&#44; but maybe thelooming edict of death caused Jochebed to appreciate her healthy baby boy alittle more. Every new life is so precious and a gift from God. Pharoah&quot;s edictwas horrendous and can only be compared to the hundreds of millions of abortions that that have been committed in the past 40 years. One look at that sweet&#44; happy baby and Jochebed was determined no one&#44; not even Pharaoh&#44; was going to kill her baby. For three months she hid him. She had to muffle everycry and perhaps cover him with blankets every time she heard voices or foot stepsoutside. Jochebed took every precaution and was a diligent guardian of herprecious cargo&#44; but she realized&#44; as her baby grew&#44; it was only a matter oftime before he would be discovered.</eng><swa></swa></text>

This was a bold move&#44; butbecause God was leading the way&#44; Moses was as safe as he possibly could be! Thebaby touched the heart of Pharaoh&quot;s daughter and because she drew him out ofthe water&#44; she named him Moses. Pharaoh&apos;s daughter (HistorianJosephus suggests her  name was Thermuthis) commissioned Moses&apos; own mother to nurse and care for him until he was weaned. In Pharaoh&quot;s house&#44; Mosesbenefited from the knowledge and luxuries of Egypt. After all the thoroughtraining Egypt had to offer&#44; Moses still had much to learn about following Godand leading God&quot;s people.</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1053' class='p'><eng>Moses heart was to deliver his people from their bondage&#44; but this was NOT God&quot;s method. God had a plan that involved the Egyptians sending off the Hebrews and giving them riches as apartial restitution. (3:21) Moses had to flee for his life to Midian because there were witnesses to his murder and Pharaoh sought for his life.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1054' class='p'><eng>2:16-22 Moses Rescues the Daughters of Reul and Dwells in Midian. Midian is a land of Arabia east of the Red Sea near Mount Sinai. When Moses reached Midian&#44; he witnessed thebullying of the seven daughters of the priest Reul. Moses plays the part of a hero and defends them against the brutish shepherds. As a reward for his heroics&#44; he was invited for supper and eventually given Zipporah to marry.Zipporah gave birth to Gershom whose name means a stranger here orrefugee. Moses also had a second son named Eliezar (18:4)&#44; but mysteriouslythere is no mention of him in this particular passage. The addition would be necessary here because Exodus 4:20 says that Moses took his wife and sons with him when he eventually returned to Egypt.Moses took up the vocation of shephered during his forty years in Midian.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1055' class='p'><eng>Exodus 3:1--NowMoses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law&#44; the priest of Midian:</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1056' class='p'><eng>When comparing Exodus 2:18 and 3:1&#44;there is some explanation necessary to justify the use of the two names &quot;Reul&quot;and &quot;Jethro&quot; for both of these names are seemingly given as names for Moses&quot;father-in-law. The identical Hebrew word we translate father-in-law in Exodus3:1 is translated son-in-law in Genesis 19:14. Many learned scholars of Hebreware puzzled by this word&#44; but it seems to be a general term for a relativeby marriage&#44; and the context of its use can only identify its precisemeaning. With this in mind&#44; some have speculated that Reul was the name ofMoses&quot; father-in-law and Jethro or Hobab was Reul&quot;s son&#44; and Moses&quot;brother-in-law. It is still possible that Reul&#44; Jethro&#44; Raguel&#44; Hobab&#44; Keyniare all names of one man&#44; Moses&quot; father-in-law. A third possibility is Ruel wasthe grandfather of Zipporah and Jethro was the immediate father of the sevensisters and Moses&quot; father-in-law. (Ex 2:18; 3:1; 4:18; 18:1; Nu 10:29; Judges1:16; 4:11) </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1057' class='p'><eng>2:23-4:28 God Sets His GreatPlan of Deliverance in Motion. About Forty years after Moses fled fromEgypt&#44; the king of Egypt died. Pharaoh&quot;s death made Moses&quot; return to Egyptpossible since he had made search for Moses for murdering the Egyptian. Also&#44;at this time the cry for deliverance among the Hebrew slaves was coming to a.climax. God heard their groaning and in remembrance of his covenant withAbraham&#44; Isaac and Jacob and had respect unto them&#44; that is&#44; God regardedtheir plight and did not ignore their cry. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1058' class='p'><eng>In response to Israel&apos;s cry&#44; God set in motion his miraculous plan of deliverance by making a most unusual visit to Moses. Moses&#44; who kept the flock of Jethro&#44; led the flock to the backside ofthe desert to the mountain of God (this mountain had two peaks named Horeband Sinai. Sinai is the most popular name since it means bush andmakes reference to the miraculous visitation of God.) As he made his climb upthe mount&#44; Moses was startled by the sight of a bush on fire that was notconsumed by the flame. The fact the bush did not burn up was a great curiosityto Moses and he turned aside to inspect it. The fire was not God&#44; but God spokeout of the midst of the fire. God is spoken of as a fire in many other versesof Scripture&#44; but only as a figure of speech. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1059' class='p'><eng>1)The Fire that Did not Consume theBush spoke of God&apos;s mercy. Just as the bush was not consumed&#44; Moses was able to speak with and look upon themanifestation of God without dying. The saints of God are not destroyed by thefire of God&#44; but are purified by it! Compare Psalm 68:2 and Luke 3:16.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1060' class='p'><eng>2)AConsuming Fire speaks of the intensity and heat of God&apos;s jealousy for His people. (Deut. 4:24;9:3; Eze. 36:5; 2 Thess. 1:8; Rev. 20:9)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1061' class='p'><eng>Moses had several questions and although they were evidences of his own weaknesses&#44; now was definitely the time to deal with them! If Moses waited until he stood before Pharaoh to count thecost and the ramifications of his quest&#44; he might have backed down to the kingand made a hasty retreat. There is never a benefit in being anything less than100% open to God because there is no escaping His judgment. We can either faceHis anger now while it is mixed with mercy or later when eternal judgment isset. It does not get any easier by trying to avoid correction. Moses istransparent before God with his questions and after some rebuke and instructionfrom the Lord&#44; he is all the better for it: </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1062' class='p'><eng>1Who amI? 3:11&#44;12 God not only ordained Moses to speak&#44; but gave him the very words to say. Moses was sent under the authority of Almighty God and not undersome birth right of his own.</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1064' class='p'><eng>3What if they do not believe me? 4:1-9 Two signs (The Rod &amp; Leprosy) were given to Moses. They spoke of the call&#44; will and authority ofGod.

<text id='1065' class='p'><eng>4Cansomeone else do this because I am not able to speak? 4:10-17 God responds with a very strong rebuke of Moses.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1066' class='p'><eng>In 4:18-26&#44;Moses learned a serious lesson: God requires implicit (exact) obedience. God will keep His Word and expects us to keep our end of the bargain. Mosesslackness almost cost him his life and he was only rescued by the action ofZipporah.</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1069' class='p'><eng>Nine times in this account we read the phrase &quot;let My people go.&quot; It was God&quot;s will that the Hebrews be free and He worked it out exactly as He had promised (3:21).

<text id='1216' class='p'><eng>Exodus 15:22--SoMoses brought Israel from the Red sea&#44; and they went out into the wilderness ofShur; and they went three days in the wilderness&#44; and found no water. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1217' class='p'><eng>Shur was a city on the north-eastern border of Egypt that was close to the location of modern Suez and it is alsothe name of its adjoining desert that stretches toward Canaan. The name Shurmeans &quot;wall or that which limits&quot; and was probably the last Arabiantown before entering Egypt.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1218' class='p'><eng>It is mentioned elsewhere inScripture: Hagar&quot;s Flight (Gen 16:7) Abraham dwelled between Kadesh and Shur(Gen. 20:1) and in Genesis 25:18; I Samuel 15:7; 27:8. It is also called&quot;Etham&quot; in Exodus 13:20 and Numbers 33:6-8; </eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1220' class='p'><eng>Israel&quot;s condition of having no water in the wilderness of Shur was magnified by the discovery of water that was undrinkable. Marah means bitter.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1221' class='p'><eng>Israel responds by murmuring for the second time since leaving Egypt (14:11&#44;12) and continues a habit of complaining and murmuring when faced with an obstacle. This was part of the&quot;slave mentality&quot; that God designed to work out of them in the wildernessbefore bringing them into their inheritance. They had been slaves accustomed todefeat and mistreatment for so long&#44; God had to teach them that they couldovercome and be victors in the face of difficulty.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1222' class='p'><eng>The miracle that occurs here is mysteriously suggestive of the cross of Christ. Moses casts a TREE into the waters which are sweetened and then God gives a mighty promise directly relatedto the sufferings of Christ on the cross.</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1227' class='p'><eng>It is amazingly apparent by the discovery at Elim that God is purposefully and sovereignly teaching Israel to trust Him. God knew what is was deep in their hearts despite all the singingand dancing after the Red Sea crossing. Immediately following that mountaintopexperience he leads them into a place with no water and then a place with waterthat cannot be drunk. After miraculously cleansing those waters&#44; Godprovidentially brings them to an oasis bursting with water.

<text id='1354' class='h2'><eng>INTRODUCTION</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1355' class='p'><eng>A.Leviticus--TheName</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1356' class='p'><eng>Levi was the third son of Jacob (Gen.29:34) and more importantly the tribe which produced Aaron (Ex.4:14) the first High Priest after the Levitical Priesthood. Thepriesthood and sacrifices&#44; although&#44; did not begin with Aaron(Heb. 7:11).When the Israelites left Egypt&#44; the ancient manner of worship was stillobserved by them&#44; the eldest son of each house inheriting the priest's office&#44;but this change was made at Mount Sinai conferring upon Aaron and his sons this office.<a href='#2547' >[15]</a></eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1357' class='p'><eng>And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother&#44; and his sons with him&#44; from among the children of Israel&#44; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office....--Ex. 28:1</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1358' class='p'><eng>The Hebrews refer to this book as&quot;The Priest&quot;s Law &quot; <a href='#2547' >[16]</a>.The book of Hebrews is the source for the Vulgate title of this book and is its best commentary1:</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1359' class='p'><eng>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood&#44; (for under it the people received the law&#44;)what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order ofMelchisedec&#44; and not be called after the order of Aaron?--Heb.  7:11; Ps. 110:4</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1360' class='p'><eng>NOTE: Paul is establishing  the paramount conclusion that as important as the Law and specifically the priesthood of the Old Testament was&#44; it was not established byGod as the end of His Divine purpose&#44; but a building block and lesson preparingthe way for a more perfect system of communing with God. Heb. 9:11; 10:1</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1361' class='p'><eng>B.Leviticus--TheSetting</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1362' class='p'><eng>This book is generally held to be the work of Moses&#44; though he was probably assisted by Aaron.  Its date is B. C.1490.  It contains the history of the first month of their second year afterleaving Egypt.sup1</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1368' class='p'><eng>The reaches of God&apos;s grace extend far beyond what the human mind can understand. We are speechless and amazed at the grace and mercy of God. There is no human effort that could be even closelycompared to God&quot;s actions of love toward his people. All humanity was guilty ofthe greatest treason against God and yet Christ has positioned himself as oursin bearer and substitute! God has made provision so that the enemy can bebecome friend&#44; the slave can be become a servant of love&#44; and the outcast canbecome a beloved member of the family. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1369' class='p'><eng>A student of the Bible and humanity must be puzzled with the same question as Nicodemus in John 3:9:</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1370' class='p'><eng>HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE?</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1371' class='p'><eng> &quot;Approved Unto God&quot; (II Tim. 2:15)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1372' class='p'><eng>&quot;Peace with God&quot; (Rom. 5:1)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1373' class='p'><eng>&quot;Come boldly unto the throne of grace&quot; (Heb. 4:16)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1374' class='p'><eng>&quot;Friend of God&quot; (James 2:23)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1375' class='p'><eng>&quot;Be with Me [Jesus]&quot; (Luke 23:43)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1376' class='p'><eng>&quot;Be Ye Holy&quot; (Lev. 20:7)</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1377' class='p'><eng>B.The Purpose of the Old Testament Sacrifices</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1378' class='p'><eng>It is absolutely imperative that it be established in our minds that the redemption and justification of mankind is possible only through the ublood of Jesus. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1379' class='p'><eng>Hebrews 9:12-14--Neither by the blood of goats and calves&#44; but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place&#44; having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if theblood of bulls and of goats&#44; and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean&#44;sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall uthe blood ofChrist&#44; who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God&#44;purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1380' class='p'><eng>In light of Christ&apos;s sacrifice on the cross&#44; the &quot;bloody&quot; book of Leviticus comes alive with relevance. Leviticus is not outdated because of Christ&quot;s death&#44; but stillserves the same purpose as it did before His death. The purpose of thesacrifices of Leviticus and the sum of the Old Testament is to point to Christ.The law is a school master that makes clear definition of right&#44; wrong&#44; andremedy. As we look into this great study of Leviticus&#44; keep in mind that eachsacrifice&#44; feast&#44; and ordinance given by God is a portrait of Christ and hisdealings with mankind.</eng><swa></swa></text>

This provisionmostly involves those sins committed in ignorance. The Trespass Offering is asubclass of the Sin offering.

<text id='1430' class='p'><eng> 7:35--uThisis the portion of the anointing of Aaron&#44; and of the anointing of his sons&#44;out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire&#44; in the day when he presentedthem to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office;</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1431' class='p'><eng>7:37--This is the  law of the burnt offering&#44; of the meat offering&#44; and of the sin offering&#44; and of the trespass offering&#44; and of the consecrations&#44;and of the sacrifice of the upeace offerings;</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1432' class='p'><eng>I.TheSeparation of the People of God</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1433' class='p'><eng>God&quot;s people were expected to keep the law of God and live lies free of sin. But&#44; a remedy was in place in the event the law was broken. This remedy ultimately is the atoning blood of Jesusbut initially was the sacrifice of animals (beginning back in the garden ofEden) which points toward Christ&quot;s ultimate sacrifice.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1434' class='p'><eng>The priests were to live separate in order to function in their priestly duties. Their very approval into the ministry required an implicit dedication and consecration to God.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1435' class='p'><eng>In 7:37&#44; the &quot;consecrations&quot;were the sacrifices and offerings which involved the dedication to God&apos;s service. The word &quot;consecrations&quot; literally means &quot;a filling up&#44; or filling ofthe hands.&quot; In Exodus 29:2&#44; eil milluim &#44; means the ram of filling up.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1436' class='p'><eng>A persons hands were filled with an offering to present to God&#44; when they were dedicated to God. The word consecration signifies the filling up or filling the hands. These class ofofferings were not only for atonement but were also a means for approachingGod. (The same principal is loosely paralleled in Esther 4:11.)</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1644' class='p'><eng>Remember&#44; the Bible is first a spiritualBook. No matter what section of the Holy Scripture we study its highest concernwill always be a spiritual one. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1645' class='p'><eng>The  Bible is useful for business&#44;reliable for history&#44; and a fascinating read&#44; but every precept laid out andrecorded account reveals a spiritual lesson: </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1646' class='p'><eng>-1Genesis&quot; creation is an elaborate revelation of salvation. Christ speaks life and light into our chaos and creates new life.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1647' class='p'><eng>-2The Hebrew Exodus parallels spiritual deliverance from the bonds of sin and this world.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1648' class='p'><eng>-3InNumbers&#44; the Israelites&quot; journey through the wilderness provokes thought concerning the spiritual themes of full reliance upon God and the life livedwalking in the Spirit.

<text id='1649' class='p'><eng>To the spiritual mind&#44; a study of the O.T. law is quickening and provocative&#44; but the carnal mind might find it lackluster.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1650' class='p'><eng>ICorinthians2:14-16--But the natural man receiveth not the things of theSpirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them&#44;because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he that is spiritual judgeth allthings&#44; yet he himself is judged of no man. 16 For who hath known the mind ofthe Lord&#44; that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1651' class='p'><eng>The study of the offerings and priesthood is insightfully rich in teaching us how to approach a holy God andour service to Him. The blood of goats point to the Savior Jesus Christ and theinstruction of Moses is council from the ALMIGHTY GOD.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1652' class='p'><eng>Do not study the Bible merely intellectually as a scholar&#44; but devour the spirit of Its message heartily!</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1707' class='p'><eng>This total does not agree with the particulars; for theGershonites were 7&#44;500&#44; the Kohathites 8&#44;600&#44; the Merarites 6&#44;200&#44; total22&#44;300.  Several methods of solving this difficulty have been proposed bylearned men; Dr. Kennicott's is the most simple.  Formerly the numbers in theHebrew Bible were expressed by letters&#44; and not by words at full length; and iftwo nearly similar letters were mistaken for each other&#44; many errors in thenumbers must be the consequence. Now it is probable that an error has creptinto the number of the Gershonites&#44; Nu 3:22&#44; where&#44; instead of 7&#44;500&#44; we shouldread 7&#44;200&#44; as K caph&#44; 500&#44; might have been easily mistaken for r resh&#44; 200&#44;especially if the down stroke of the caph had been a little shorter thanordinary&#44; which is often the case in MSS.  The extra 300 being taken off&#44; thetotal is just 22&#44;000&#44; as mentioned in the 39th verse. </eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1823' class='p'><eng>Numbers19:2 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORDhath commanded&#44; saying&#44; Speak unto the children of Israel&#44; that they bring theea red heifer without spot&#44; wherein is no blemish&#44; and upon which never cameyoke:</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1824' class='p'><eng>This chapter is only concerning the preparing and using of the ashes which were to infuse the water of purification. The people had complained of the strictness of the law&#44; whichforbade their near approach to the tabernacle&#44; </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1825' class='p'><eng>Num. 17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1826' class='p'><eng>In answer to this complaint&#44; they are here directed to purify themselves&#44; so as that they might come as far asthey had occasion without fear.  </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1827' class='p'><eng>I. The method of preparing these ashes&#44; by the burning of a red heifer&#44; with a great deal of ceremony&#44; Nu 19:1-10. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1828' class='p'><eng>II. The way of using them.</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1829' class='p'><eng>1. They were designed to purify persons from the pollution contracted by a dead body&#44; Nu 19:11-16. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1830' class='p'><eng>2. They were to be put into running water (a small quantity of them)&#44; with which the person to be cleansed must bepurified&#44; Nu 19:17-22. And that this ceremonial purification was a type andfigure of the cleansing of the consciences of believers from the pollutions ofsin appears by the apostle's discourse&#44; (Heb 9:13&#44;14)&#44; where he compares theefficacy of the blood of Christ with the sanctifying virtue that was in&quot;the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean.&quot; </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1831' class='p'><eng>In Numbers 19:1-10&#44; We have here the divine appointment concerning the solemn burning of a red heifer to ashes&#44;and the preserving of the ashes&#44; that of them might be made&#44; not a beautifying&#44;but a purifying&#44; water&#44; for that was the utmost the law reached to; it offerednot to adorn as the gospel does&#44; but to cleanse only. This burning of theheifer&#44; though it was not properly a sacrifice of atonementfor wrong done&#44; being not performed at the altar&#44; yet was typical of thedeath and sufferings of Christ&#44; by which he intended&#44; not only to satisfy God'sjustice&#44; but to purify and pacify our consciences&#44; that we may have peace withGod and also peace in our own bosoms&#44; to prepare for which Christ died&#44; notonly like the bulls and goats at the altar&#44; but like the heifer without thecamp.  </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1832' class='p'><eng>I.There was a great deal of care employed in the choice of the heifer that was to be burnt&#44; much more than in the choice of any other offering&#44; </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1833' class='p'><eng>Num. 19:2 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORDhath commanded&#44; saying&#44; Speak unto the children of Israel&#44; that they bring theea red heifer without spot&#44; wherein is no blemish&#44; and upon which never cameyoke:</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1834' class='p'><eng>a.It must not only be without blemish&#44; typifying the spotless purity and sinless perfection of the Lord Jesus&#44;</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1835' class='p'><eng>b.It must be a red heifer&#44; because of the rarity of the colour&#44; that it might be the more remarkable: the Jews say&#44;  </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1836' class='p'><eng>&quot;If but two hairs were black or white&#44; it was unlawful.&quot;</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1837' class='p'><eng>Christ&#44; as man&#44; was the Son of Adam&#44; red earth&#44; and we find him red in his apparel&#44; red with his own blood&#44; and red with the blood of hisenemies. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1838' class='p'><eng>c.It must be one on which never came yoke&#44; which was not insisted on in other sacrifices&#44; but thus was typified the voluntary offer of the Lord Jesus&#44; whenhe said&#44; Lo&#44; I come&#44; He was bound and held with no other cords than those ofhis own love. This heifer was to be provided at the expense of thecongregation&#44; because they were all to have a joint interest in it; and so allbelievers have in Christ. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1839' class='p'><eng>II.There was to be a great deal of ceremony in the burning of it.  The care of doing it was committed to Eleazar&#44; not to Aaron himself&#44; because it was notfit that he should do anything to render himself ceremonially unclean&#44; no&#44; notso much as till the evening Num. 19:3;:Num. 19:8; yet it being an affair ofgreat concern especially in the significancy of it&#44; it was to be performed byhim that was next to Aaron in dignity.  The chief priests of that time had theprincipal hand in the death of Christ. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1840' class='p'><eng>1. The heifer was to be slain without the camp&#44; as an impure thing&#44; which identifies the insufficiency of the methods prescribed by the ceremonial law to take awaysin. So far were they from cleansing effectually that they were themselvesunclean; as if the pollution that was laid upon them continued to cleave tothem.  Yet&#44; to answer this type&#44; our Lord Jesus&#44; being made sin and a curse forus&#44; suffered without the gate&#44; Heb 13:12. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1841' class='p'><eng>2. Eleazar was to sprinkle the blood directly before the door of the tabernacle&#44; and looking steadfastly towards it&#44; </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1842' class='p'><eng>Nu 19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger&#44; and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of thecongregation seven times:</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1843' class='p'><eng>This made it in some sort an expiation; for the sprinkling of the blood before the Lord was the chief solemnity in all the sacrifices ofatonement; therefore&#44; though this was not done at the altar&#44; yet&#44; being donetowards the sanctuary&#44; it was closely relatedthat the virtue and validity of it depended upon the sanctuary&#44; and werederived from it. This signified the satisfaction that was made to God by thedeath of Christ&#44; our great high priest&#44; who by the eternal Spirit (and theSpirit is called the finger of God&#44; (Luke 11:20) offered himself without spotunto God; directly before the sanctuary&#44; when he said&#44; Father&#44; into thy hands Icommit my spirit.  It also signifies how necessary it was to the purifying ofour hearts that satisfaction should be made to divine justice. This sprinklingof the blood put virtue into the ashes. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1844' class='p'><eng>3. The heifer was to be wholly burnt&#44; Nu 19:5. This typified the extreme sufferings of our Lord Jesus&#44; both insoul and body&#44; as a sacrifice made by fire. The priest was to cast into thefire&#44; while it was burning&#44; cedarwood&#44; hyssop&#44; and scarlet&#44; which were used inthe cleansing of lepers (Le 14:6&#44;7)&#44; that the ashes of these might be mingledwith the ashes of the heifer&#44; because they were designed for purification. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1845' class='p'><eng>4. The ashes of the heifer(separated as well as they could from the ashes of the wood wherewith it wasburnt) were to be carefully gathered up by the hand of a clean person&#44; andpounded and sifted&#44; and so laid up for the use of the congregation&#44; (Nu 19:9)&#44;not only for that generation&#44; but for posterity; for the ashes of this oneheifer were sufficient to season as many vessels of water as the people ofIsrael would need for many ages. The Jews say that this one served till thecaptivity&#44; nearly 1000 years&#44; and that there was never another heifer burnttill Ezra's time&#44; after their return&#44; grounded only upon the silence of theirold records in the later times of their church&#44; of which they had more fullrecords&#44; they find eight burnt between Ezra's time and the destruction of thesecond temple&#44; which was about 500 years&#44; These ashes are said to be laid uphere as a purification for sin&#44; because&#44; though they were intended to purifyonly from ceremonial uncleanness&#44; yet they were a type of that purification forsin which our Lord Jesus made by his death. Ashes mixed with water are used inscouring&#44; but these had their virtue purely from the divine institution&#44; andtheir accomplishment and perfection in Christ&#44; who is the end of this law forrighteousness. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1846' class='p'><eng>a. That the water of purification was made so by the ashes of a heifer&#44; whose blood was sprinkled before thesanctuary; so that which cleanses our consciences is the abiding virtue of thedeath of Christ; it is his blood that cleanses from all sin&#44; 1Jo 1:7. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1847' class='p'><eng>b.. That the ashes were sufficient for all the people.  There needed not to be a fresh heifer slain for everyperson or family that had occasion to be purified&#44; but this one was enough forall&#44; even for the strangers that sojourned among them (Nu 19:10); so there isvirtue enough in the blood of Christ for all that repent and believe thegospel&#44; for every Israelite&#44; and not for their sins only&#44; but for the sins ofthe whole world&#44; 1Jo 2:2. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1848' class='p'><eng>c. That these ashes were capable of being preserved without waste to many ages. No bodily substance is soincorruptible as ashes are&#44; these a very fit emblem of the everlasting efficacyof the sacrifice of Christ. He is able to save&#44; and able to cleanse&#44; to theuttermost.  </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1849' class='p'><eng>d. These ashes were laid up as a stock or treasure&#44; for the constant purification of Israel from theirpollutions; so the blood of Christ is laid up for us in the word as aninexhaustible fountain of merit&#44; to which by faith we may have recourse dailyfor the purging of our consciences; see Zec 13:1. </eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1850' class='p'><eng>e. All those that were employed in this service were made ceremonially unclean by it; even Eleazar himself&#44; thoughhe did but sprinkle the blood&#44; Nu 19:7. He that burned the heifer was unclean(Nu 19:8)&#44; and he that gathered up the ashes (Nu 19:10); so all that had a handin putting Christ to death contracted guilt by it: his betrayer&#44; hisprosecutors&#44; his judge&#44; his executioner&#44; all did what they did with wickedhands&#44; though it was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God (Ac2:23); yet some of them were&#44; and all might have been cleansed by the virtue ofthat same blood which they had brought themselves under the guilt of. Some makethis to signify the imperfection of the legal services&#44; and their insufficiencyto take away sin&#44; inasmuch as those who prepared for the purifying of otherswere themselves polluted by the preparation. The Jews say&#44; This is a mysterywhich Solomon himself did not understand&#44; that the same thing should pollutethose that were clean and purify those that were unclean. </eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1857' class='p'><eng>[The book of the wars of the Lord]  There are endless conjectures about this book&#44; both among ancients and moderns.  Dr. Lightfoot'sopinion is the most simple&#44; and to me bears the greatest appearance of beingthe true one.  &quot;This book seems to have been some book of remembrances anddirections&#44; written by Moses for Joshua's private instruction for the managementof the wars after him.  See Ex 17:14-16.  It may be that this was the same bookwhich is called the book of Jasher&#44; i. e.&#44; the book of the upright&#44; or adirectory for Joshua&#44; from Moses&#44; what to do and what to expect in his wars;and in this book it seems as if Moses directed the setting up of archery&#44; see2Sa 1:18&#44; and warrants Joshua to command the sun&#44; and expect its obedience&#44; Jos10:13.&quot;</eng><swa></swa></text>

<text id='1862' class='p'><eng>The idea of providing cities of refuge (Joshua 20:1-9) for capital offenses is rooted in the tension between customary tribal law (retaliation or revenge&#44; in which the blood relative isobligated to execute vengeance) and civil law (carried out less personally byan assembly according to a standard code of justice).</eng><swa></swa></text>
<text id='1863' class='p'><eng>Blood feuds are usually associated with nomadic groups;legal procedures&#44; with villages and towns.

Although it exists only in later copies&#44; it was probably composed at Babylon in the Kassite period to celebrate Babylon's victory (c.1450 BC) over the Sea land.
