<p><b><u>It&rsquo;s in the Valleys I Grow</u></b></p>
<p>Sometimes life seems hard to bear,</p>
<p>Full of sorrow, trouble and woe</p>
<p>It's then I have to remember</p>
<p>That it's in the valleys I grow.</p>
<p>If I always stayed on the mountain top</p>
<p>And never experienced pain,</p>
<p>I would never appreciate God's love</p>
<p>And would be living in vain.</p>
<p>I have so much to learn</p>
<p>And my growth is very slow,</p>
<p>Sometimes I need the mountain tops,</p>
<p>But it's in the valleys I grow.</p>
<p>I do not always understand</p>
<p>Why things happen as they do,</p>
<p>But I am very sure of one thing.</p>
<p>My Lord will see me through.</p>
<p>My little valleys are nothing</p>
<p>When I picture Christ on the cross</p>
<p>He went through the valley of death;</p>
<p>His victory was Satan's loss.</p>
<p>Forgive me Lord, for complaining</p>
<p>When I'm feeling so very low.</p>
<p>Just give me a gentle reminder</p>
<p>That it's in the valleys I grow.</p>
<p>Continue to strengthen me, Lord</p>
<p>And use my life each day</p>
<p>To share your love with others</p>
<p>And help them find their way.</p>
<p>Thank you for valleys, Lord</p>
<p>For this one thing I know</p>
<p>The mountain tops are glorious</p>
<p>But it's in the valleys I grow!</p>
