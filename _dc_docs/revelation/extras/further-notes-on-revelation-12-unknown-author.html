These notes are pages 13 to 17 of the printed document I found. It obviously is missing the 1st 12 pages. I do not know where they're from. Other than they belong to grandpa.

<h2>The Sun-Clothed Woman, continued.</h2>
<p>… And we have seen all the way through from Pentecost right on down through to this very hour. The Church is been existing, militant, and prosperous. The devil would come along and say the Church is never really accomplish too much. Brothers and sisters, I'm sure in the record of heaven you are going to find a different thing altogether. God keeps good books. The Church tonight has been insulted. It's been attacked. It's been put through the fire and burned at the stake. You read of the early disciples. Every one of them right on down through gave their lives. All was beheaded, but the Church went on. They crucified Peter upside down, but the Church 1st, because it wasn't Peter's Church. Jesus said, "I will build my Church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Brother, God himself is building the Church and, the gates of hell shall not prevail against it, even though the devil would try to come against it with every devilish thing that he can. He's tried to attack it from every side. He's tried to attack that which the Church is been built upon, the rock of revelation. Jesus said, "I'm going to build my Church." What is it that causes you to stand in your heavenly position are sick heavenly places? What is it that carries you above the power of darkness? It is the revelation of the word; the revelation of Jesus Christ. He has built his Church on revelation, and against this Church the gates of hell shall not prevail.</p>
<p>he is not just building a church in the same time, he has built it. The church is still in existence even though maybe as far as denominations and man's organization within the framework of the church, we become disgusted with what we see. Yes, God has a church tonight. Look at Ephesians 1:19 to 2###I think this is one of the most thrilling things that the Holy Spirit has come toward the believer.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:19 to 23--And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power.</p>
<p>we want the Lord to do great things in us. We want to see great things done. We say, "oh Lord, can you do great things for us?" The word of the Lord gives the answer. The Lord already has done great things.</p>
<p>and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us for which he rot in Christ, when he raised him from the bed, and set him at his own right hand and the heavenly places, far above all principality, empower, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and that for all things under his feet, and gave them to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body,</p>
<p>what is the church tonight? The body of Christ and he has put all things under his, we are his body. We are more than conquerors in the church tonight is more than a comical. The "moon is under her feet."</p>
<p>now, going into the last part of the verse, "upon her head a crown of 12 stars." There are a lot of folks that will say that these are the 12 apostles. Time to Ephesians 2:19 to 20.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:19, 20 "Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.</p>
<p>Also you will find that in the new city Jerusalem the stones will have the names of the 12 apostles recorded on them. Now then, the foundation stone sound to me a whole lot different than stars on a crown. I cannot fathom how foundation stones can be interpreted for 12 stars in a crown. The crown here has to do with the kingdom. The moment you think about a crown, you think about royalty, somebody was been crowned. Therefore there must be a kingdom, and when you have a crown or kingdom have old and authority and government. Also, a crown speaks of reward. Isn't this all true? Now when you begin to think of this in the light of Scripture and John already seen this one crowned, before the child is produced; then we look for someone in the Scripture was already entered into a crown position, was enrolled, was now governing. Now it's got to be in connection with the church because we just proved from the Scripture that the church is referred to here. But now it doesn't say upon her feet were upon her shoulder, but "upon her head a crown of 12 stars." Isn't it that what it says? Now look at Ephesians 1:22</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:22 "that he is the head of the church</p>
<p>Again look in Ephesians 5:23</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:23 "Christ is the head of the church.</p>
<p>so then, we are seeing something of a body composed of Jesus Christ the head and the great body of his people making up the body of the church. Now where is Christ tonight? Where is his position? Is he on the earth? He is in the place of authority. Isn't that right? He's already entered into the kingdom. He is an rulership tonight. He's already been crowned. 12 had to do with heavenly perfection. I'm sure it must have some significance, probably having to do with the greatness of the Lord. I'm sure it is something more than the fact that it speaks about 12 apostles. It has something to do with the office and function and the reward of the Lord Jesus Christ. He learned obedience to the things he suffered, and he became the capital of our salvation and was made perfect by these things. He brings 5:8; Hebrews 2:10.</p>
<p>This is his earthly life that we are talking about, and Jesus received a reward for this. He has already entered and and he is already crowned the King of kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
<p>one other thought with this: because he is the head of the church is part of his body, therefore he being the king, we must then also share in his rule and authority.</p>
<p>I Peter 2:9 "but ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, and a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</p>
<p>"royal priesthood…"</p>
<p>Revelation 1:6 " And hath made us kings, and priests unto God and his father; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever.</p>
<p>this is just the 1st step of the lesson, just trying to establish in your mind with this woman is. It's the church in a militant position, with the Lord Jesus Christ, and close relationship with them.</p>
<p>there is a cry and a travail in the church to bring forth a company of over commerce, the people that will live according to the truth of God, out of the church, out of this militant body.</p>
<p>you and I know tonight that the church is in a state different from what it was when it started at Pentecost. When Pentecost came over when the church started, it was like a young birds and going out to wrestling fight over common to conquer. But now it as she has come to the end of the age, it's a woman over grown and developed, producing something by the spirit of God. She has become weakened and in pain and agony, ready to be delivered. This is the state of the church tonight because she is getting ready to bring forth. Why do you think we're living in an age when the Holy Ghost is being poured out in the manner in which it is? You know what happens to woman in the last phases are stages of being with child? As the last days,, she becomes greatly enlarged. This is what you see here, a woman enlarged and in pain ready to be delivered. I believe that we are living in a time when the Holy Ghost and the church has leaped over the denominational barriers. We put them up, God didn't. The Holy Ghost isn't breathing men today bringing them into something, that he might bring out of them the most wonderful thing that has happened since the dawn of creation, which is a manchild that is going to shake loose creation itself; and manifestation of sons of God in these last days. Romans 8:19 " 23.</p>
<p>this is not going to be the whole church itself. The church will go into the tribulation hour just like this revelation declares.</p>
<p>there is a people that is going to come out and "escape all these things," "and stand before the Son of Man." Luke 21:3###You say what you want to…</p>
