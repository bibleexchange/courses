<h1>The Fifth Letter: Sardis</h1>
<p>Revelation 3:1-6</p>
<h2>Messenger - "Martin Luther"</h2>
<blockquote>"Unto the angel of the church in Sardis"</blockquote>

<p>Martin Luther was a brilliant scholar of gentle disposition. He had been studying to be a lawyer when the death of a friend caused him to become serious concerning the spiritual condition of his own life. He soon entered the Augustinian convent at Erfurt in 1505 where he studied philosophy and also the Word of God</p>
<p>Luther lived a life of severe penance but all his self affliction was in vain.</p>
<blockquote>I tormented myself to death to make peace with God, but I was in darkness and found it not. --Martin Luther</blockquote>
<p>Martin Luther became a priest. On a visit to Rome he saw the futility of the Church's works.</p>
<p>The Word of God struck his heart. "The Just Shall Live By Faith" Mixing the Word of God with faith, Martin Luther was Born-again into the Family of God</p>

<p>Luther fought against anti-scriptural teaching. When Leo X became Pope, and John Tetzel came to sell indulgences for sin, Luther first preached against it in his pulpit and then wrote his famous 95 thesis. On October 31, 1517 he nailed his 95 thesis to the door of the Wittenberg Cathedral. He preached emphatically the Doctrine of Justification By Faith</p>

<p>Luther translated the N.T. and gave it to the people in their own language. Aided by Hebrew scholars, he translated the O.T.</p>
<p>It was recorded in Sauer's History Vol. 3, p. 406 that Luther was:</p>
<blockquote>a prophet, evangelist, speaker in tongues, interpreter, in one person endowed with all nine gifts of the Spirit.</blockquote>

<h2>City - "Sardis"</h2>
<p>Sardis was the capital of ancient Lydia. At one time, it was very important commercially. Sardis was destroyed by an earthquake in AD 17, but it was rebuilt. It was one of the great cities of western Asia Minor until the later Byzantine period. It fell out of importance as newer networks of roads and commerce bypassed the city. Today it is a heap of ruins and largely uninhabited.</p>
<p>"Sardis" means The Escaped One. The age lasted from 1520 to 1750. The Sardis Church Age is called the Age of Reformation.</p>
