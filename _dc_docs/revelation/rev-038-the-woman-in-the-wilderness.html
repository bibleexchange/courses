<h1>The Woman in the Wilderness, Rev. 12:6; 13-16</h1>

<p>REVIEW: Verses 1 and 5 described the Woman as being "clothed with the sun", "having the moon under her feet", "upon her head a crown of twelve stars" and from out of her is produced the Man Child. We believe these details and the fact the this book is to be interpreted as prophecy identify this Woman as the Church or Body of Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2>The Flight of the Woman, vs. 6,13-16</h2>

<h3>The Reason For Her Flight, vs.13.</h3>

<blockquote>Revelation 12:12&mdash;Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</blockquote>

<p>She makes her flight to the wilderness because she is persecuted ("dioko" to put to flight, drive away, to pursue) by the Dragon. Satan being ejected from heaven, by the Man Child with the aid of Michael and his angels, turns his wrath and venom on the woman. Satan persecutes the woman for two reasons: </p>

<h4>Having been cast out of heaven the Man Child is out of his reach.</h4>
<h4>The woman is to be "blamed" for bringing forth the Man Child.</h4>
<p>Notice that the dragon's attention is on the Man Child and readies to pounce as soon as the Man Child is brought forth. The Dragon is not concerned with the Woman until He is defated and cast down to the earth. His attack on the Against the Woman is an act of defiant rage.</p>
