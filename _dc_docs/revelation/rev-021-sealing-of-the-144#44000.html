<h1>The Sealing of the 144,000. 7:1-8</h1>
<p>The judgment has begun, and has progressed through a number of its most important stages, but grace has not entirely departed. The sealing must take place before the judgment can continue. vs. 1-3</p>
<h2>Who The 144,000 Are vs. 4</h2>
<p>"Of all the tribes of the children of Israel. " They are Jews- not the Church. The sealed ones are one company, complete in itself; and the Elders and Living ones are 
another company complete in themselves. John sees them all at the same time, the one in the presence of the other.
12 thousand from each tribe:</p>
<h3>Judah -confession or praise of God</h3>
<h3>Reuben- behold a Son or viewing the Son</h3>
<h3>Gad -a company or a troupe</h3>
<h3>Asher- blessed or happy</h3>
<h3>Naphtali- obtained by wrestling</h3>
<h3>Manasseh -making to forget</h3>
<h3>Simeon -hearing or obeying</h3>
<h3>Levi -adhesion or cleaving to</h3>
<h3>Issachar -a reward</h3>
<h3>Zebulon- habitation or dwelling</h3>
<h3>Joseph -added or addition</h3>
<h3>Benjamin- Son of the right hand</h3>
<p>Look at them all together. Confessors or praises of God, looking upon the Son, a company of blessed ones, wrestling or fighting for what is ahead, forgetting these things that are behind, hearing and obeying the word, cleaving unto the reward of a heavenly habitation, an addition to what has already happened, sons of the day of God's hand, or the day of His Power, begotten in the extremity of the age.</p>
<p>One reason the names of Dan and Ephraim is left out. Dan means a judge. These 144,000 are not judges, and never become judges. Ephraim -double fruitfulness, or increase, or growth by multiplication. These are a fixed number 144,000. These are Israelites, living in the period of the judgment, who confess and look to Christ as their Messiah.</p>
