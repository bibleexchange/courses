<p>The whole course of the church: Prologue -- Interlude -- Epilogue</p>
<h2>The Truthfulness of These Writings</h2>
<p>"These sayings are faithful and true"</p>
<p>Said of the Lord Himself "Never a man spake like this man."</p>
<p>Thrice it is repeated --</p>
<p>Rev 19:9 21:5 -- 22:6</p>
<p>Thrice it is affirmed -- That these are from God.</p>
<p>Rev 1:1 " He sent and signified it by his angel unto His servant John:"</p>
<p>Also here. Rev 22:6</p>
<p>And Rev 22:16 "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things."</p>
<p>Either this book is nothing but forgery -- Or it is the most authoritative writings --</p>
<p>These Are Gods Own Words -- "Faithful And True"</p>
<p>We must take them --</p>
<p>We must build our faith on them -</p>
<p>We must testify to the Church + World of them.</p>
<h2>The Repetition of Benediction --</h2>
<p>Rev 1:3 here Rev 22:7</p>
<p>Is there another Book ?</p>
<p>So intense</p>
<p>So emphatic</p>
<p>So constant</p>
<p>Of the good to be gained --And the ill to be avoided.</p>
<p>The Effect Upon The Apostle</p>
<p>Vs. 8-9</p>
<h2>Direct Orders Concerning This Revelation Rev 22:10</h2>
<h3>"Seal not the sayings of The Prophecy of this book."</h3>
<p>Dan 8:26 12:4,9 Daniel was told to seal up the book. John is told not to seal the book.</p>
<p>From the beginning John was directed to write what he saw and heard, and to make it known to the Churches. Rev 1:11, 19 Prophetical messages to each church. Rev 2:1, 8, 12, 18, 3:1, 7, 14.</p>
<h3>"Seal up."</h3>
<p>In Chapter 10 he was about to write. The Seven Thunders He was to seal this up -- But the rest he was not to Seal. He was to record them. He was to make them known. He was to publish them to the Churches. These things where written both by Command and Revelation of God.</p>
<p>See the stress, Urgency, Importance. This Book is very important to us.</p>
<h2>The Effects of This Revelation --</h2>
<p>"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still."</p>
<p>There are two schools of thought here --</p>
<h3>One -- The idea of eternal fixedness of character. When these Revelations scenes have been fulfilled.</h3>
<h3>The other idea -- is the Effect of these Words -- or this Revelation.</h3>
<p>The meaning of the text has immediate reference to the context -- to the now -- sealing- writing and publishing. For a better understanding read it --</p>
<blockquote>"Let the unjust one do injustice more and more and the filthy one defile more and more, and the righteous one do righteousness more and more."</blockquote>
<p>II Tim 3:13 Heb 6:7-9</p>
<p>The same light of the Sun breeds pestilence in the marshland. Breeds life to all. It is an ill to the ill. Good to the Good.</p>
<h2>The Rewards To All --</h2>
<blockquote>"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."</blockquote>
<h3>To the wicked -</h3>
<p>Degrees of Reward -- More tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah</p>
<h3>To the Righteous --</h3>
<p>Degrees of Reward - Not Salvation but for works.</p>
<p>Wood -- hay -- stubble Gold- Silver -- Precious Stones.</p>
