<h1>The Two Witnesses - 11:3-13</h1>
<p>These two witnesses are not presented to John in vision. They are described to him by the glorious Angel, who is the Lord Jesus Himself. The account that is given here is not John's but Christ's, given in His own words.</p>
<p>Who, then, are these Two Witnesses?The connection in which the account is given may help to give us the answer. These Witnesses come upon us suddenly, in the midst of the scenes of the Judgment, and at a time when Christ is ready to take possession of the earth.</p>

<h3>They are not Gospel Times.</h3>
<h4>The Jew and his Temple.</h4>
<h4>Ministers- different from Gospel ministers. vs. 5.</h4>
<p>They kill -vs. 10 torment - deal out fiery judgment.Avenge the very wish to injure them. We are not to avenge ourselves.Not to smite and kill our enemies - but love them.
