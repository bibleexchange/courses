<p>Revelation 3:7-13</p>

<h2>Messenger</h2>
<blockquote>"To the angel of the church in Philadelphia"</blockquote>
<p>John Wesley was born at Epworth, June 17, 1703 and died at the age of 88. He was one of nineteen children born to Samuel and Susanna Wesley. John was a brilliant scholar. He was later born again. He preached with power. The Spirit was so mightily manifested that the people would fall to the ground crying in great distress over their sins. He believed in the power of God. He prayed for the sick with results. John and Charles, his brother, drew up a spiritual guide of works. For this they were called Methodists.</p>

<h2>City - "Philadelphia"</h2>
<p>It was the second largest city in Lydia.It was built upon several hills in a famous wine-growing district.Its duration was the longest of the seven cities. It still exists under a Turkish name - City of God.</p>
<p>The Age lasted from 1750 to about 1900.Called the Age of Brotherly Love. "Philadelphia" means: love of brethren.</p>
<h2>Commendation</h2>
<blockquote>Revelation 3:8 "I know their works"</blockquote>
<h3>Their works were good</h3>
<p>He knows whether they are good or bad.</p>
<h3>They had an open door</h3>
<blockquote>"I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it."</blockquote>
<p>The Missionary effort of that age. William Carey affected a missionary program.Out of this came Spurgeon, Parker, McClaren, Edwards, Bunyan, Mueller, Barnes, Bishop</p>
<p>Also- "I am the door of the sheep" At night they go home and leave the animals, but the shepherd of sheep takes them to the fold and then lays down and becomes the door.</p>
<h3>They had a little strength</h3>
<p>The Word was preached well but they lacked the mighty power of the Holy Ghost Baptism.</p>
<h3>They kept His Word</h3>
<p>"And hast kept my word"</p>
<h3>They did not deny His name</h3>
<p>"And hast not denied my name"</p>
<h2>Complaint</h2>
<blockquote>Revelation 3:9 -- Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I loved thee.</blockquote>
<h3>Hypocrisy "say they are Jews"</h3>
<h3>Falsehood "But do lie"</h3>
