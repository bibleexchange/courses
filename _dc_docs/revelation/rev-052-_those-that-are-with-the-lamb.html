<h1>Those that are with the Lamb (17:14)</h1>
<p>In the midst of judgment within a spiritual wilderness, we see a glorious promise.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 17:14—These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</blockquote>
<p>We see the action and the resulting end of the False church, Antichrist and the powers that rule with him. They make war with the Lamb and the Lamb will overcome them! For He is Lord of lords and King of kings. There are those who set themselves in opposition to the Great King, but in this verse we also see some are "with Him". Herein is a promise to some, that they can overcome WITH the Lamb. These are the Called, Chosen and Faithful of God. These are the army of the Lamb.</p>
