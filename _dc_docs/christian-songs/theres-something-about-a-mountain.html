    <h1>There's Something About A Mountain</h1>

<h2>Verse 1</h2>
<p>Though sometimes I'm disappointed by the friends that I hold dear, <br>
I refuse to be defeated by the ghosts of doubt and fear.<br>
I could think about my weakness, keep my eyes upon the sod,<br>
But my help comes from a mountain that brings me close to God.</p>

<h2>Verse 2</h2>

<p>This old wilderness holds nothing and I'm not content to stay<br>
For I've seen a land of riches, milk and honey every day.<br>
I'll not let those mighty giants blind my eyes to Canaan's land<br>
For there's a mountain to remind me that victory's close at hand.</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>

<p>Oh there's something about a mountain that reaches for the sky,<br>
That speaks of things eternal, of a hope that never dies.<br>
Like the blessed Rock of Ages, repose amid the din,<br>
I'll just go up to the mountain and keep my trust in Him.</p>
