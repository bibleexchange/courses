<h1>Chapter 7: He is the Water of Life</h1>
<p>By the time we reach the seventh chapter of John, almost everyone in the Jewish provinces had heard about Jesus. Since Jesus had performed great miracles and said wonderful things, many of these people believed Jesus was at least a prophet from God if not the Messiah Himself; at the same time, since Jesus also disrupted the Jewish religious system that had become insipid and corrupted, there was much confrontation and division over this Son of the carpenter.</p>
<p>The problem was this, with his carnal mind man cannot understand the things of God (Romans 8:7; I Cor. 2:11). Whenever man tries in his own intellect to make sense of the things of heaven, he only results in causing confusion rather than clarity. Those that were tender to the Spirit and had a heart after God received revelation from above and they knew exactly who Jesus was.</p>
<p>The seventh chapter of John reveals two things: what the people thought abut Jesus and what Jesus proclaimed Himself to be (the water of life).</p>
<h2>Jesus’ Person Questioned 7:1-13</h2>
<p>After Jesus had healed the lame man on the Sabbath day the Jews (that is, not the Hebrew nation as a whole, but the Jewish religious hierarchy) sought to kill Jesus (John 5:16) and they were even more angered when Jesus proclaimed that He was the Son of God (John 5:18); because of this known hatred, Jesus stayed primarily out of Jewry, which was, in general, Judea, and more specifically, Jerusalem. Jesus was not afraid of dying, for He knew that at one time He would submit to their persecution and execution, but this was not the “time” (John 7:6). Also, it must be noted that the Scripture says “would not” and not “could not.” Jesus had the power from God to hold back or defeat His enemies, so He could have entered Jerusalem without any problem, but because He did not manifest that type of power then, it was out of prudence that He did not spend much time in the Holy City.</p>
<h3>Questioned by His brothers 7:2-9</h3>
<p>Because of this prudence, Jesus chose not to openly attend the Feast of the Tabernacles even though His brothers chided Him to go. These “brethren” were in truth His half-brothers, since they may have shared Mary as a mother but Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit while the others were born of Joseph. These brothers were at least two if not all four of the names listed in Matthew 13:55 (James, Joses, Simon, and Judas).</p>
<p>Although these men grew up with Jesus, heard Him speak, and were exposed to the Spirit He bore, they did not believe the He was the person that He claimed to be, the Son of God. Now, in form of jest, they wanted Him to go to Jerusalem for the feast and openly proclaim His deity. Jesus did not give in to this peer-pressure and firmly told them that it was not His time to be revealed and then He encouraged them to go to the ceremony without Him.</p>
<h3>Questioned by the people of Jerusalem 7:10-13</h3>
<p>After His brothers left southward for Jerusalem, Jesus also departed for the feast, but He did not go openly, but in secret. The people were eager to see Jesus at the feast and were perplexed when He did not show up.</p>
<p>There was mixed feelings among the people about this man, Jesus of Galilee. Some were insistent that He was a good man. They had seen Him do good works of healing and feed the multitude with the few small fish and loaves of bread; they also heard His powerful, yet compassionate teaching, and they were convinced that such things could only come from a godly person. Though they were convinced of His human virtue, they did not comprehend His divine identity.</p>
<p>There were others that thought that Jesus was only deceiving the people. They might have thought that His miracles were only illusions and that He had people pretend to be sick so that it would appear that He healed them. Neither group was comfortable voicing their opinions in public for they were afraid of what the Jewish religious leaders would have said or done to them.</p>
<h2>Jesus’ Doctrine Questioned 7:14-24</h2>
<h3>Questioned because of His lack of schooling 7:14-18</h3>
<p>During the middle of the feast (probably the fourth or fifth day of the eight day ceremony) Jesus made Himself known to be present at the feast when He went to the temple and started teaching the people. As always, Jesus’ words were full of wisdom and power. This fact caused the people to question Him and His teaching for they thought Him to be the son of a simple carpenter that had never had a proper schooling, and yet He taught such great words.</p>
<p>Jesus answered them and explained that His doctrine was not learned from man, but from God. There was no doubt that many of the Jews present had a great head-knowledge of the Scriptures, yet they had little heart-knowledge of God’s will and desire. If they had possessed this, then they would have known who Jesus was.</p>
<h3>Questioned because of His precision of knowledge 7:19-24</h3>
<p>It would be thought that when a man says what you know deep down inside is right, then you would proclaim him to be a great man of truth indeed. Too often though, as it is the nature of man, we are offended when someone tells us that we are doing wrong and we proclaim him instead to be a liar even though we know that he is speaking the truth. This is reaction the people gave when Jesus revealed that they were seeking to kill Him because He healed the man on the Sabbath day. They went far enough to even say that Jesus was possessed with a demon.</p>
<p>Rather than refuting their accusation of being bedeviled, Jesus explained why it was right to do good on the Sabbath. If it was right for Moses to command the child to be circumcised on the eighth day even if it was the day of rest, then it was equally right for Jesus to heal the man under the same circumstances.</p>
<h2>Jesus’ Office Questioned 7:25-36</h2>
<p>The people were amazed at the boldness of Jesus to proclaim Himself to be the Son of God, but they were also amazed that the religious leaders said nothing openly as Jesus made these bold statements; this brought them to wonder if their silence was their approval that Jesus was really the Christ. Even if they thought that the rulers believed that Jesus was the Christ, some of the people did not believe that He was, for they knew the history and lineage of Jesus and they felt that the Messiah would have no such traceable records. Jesus refuted this argument by again saying if they had really known God, then there would be no doubt to as whom He was--the Son of God.</p>
<p>While there were some that did not believe that Jesus was the Christ, there were many that believed that He was, and this dedication of the multitude to Jesus caused the religious leaders to fear the loss of their position as spiritual guides. Rather than refuting the doctrines of Jesus orally to the people, they chose instead to try to have Jesus taken by force and then judge Him before their council. They sent guards out to bring Jesus to them and later we read that these men came back empty handed because they so awed by the manner and authority in which Jesus spake, that they could not continue to arrest Him.</p>
<h2>Jesus’ Circumstances Questioned 7:37-53</h2>
<p>On the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles, Jesus stood (some believe on the steps of the temple) and made a loud proclamation of who He was. As we have seen, up to this point there were many man made ideas of who He was, but now Jesus wanted them to know without a doubt that He was the water of life as He cried, “If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink” (John 7:37). Jesus knew that many people would still not believe in the reality of His person, but at least they had the chance to believe on Him and receive the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Despite this bold proclamation, there were still many doubts as why Jesus could not be the Messiah; this time the people questioned His circumstances that surrounded His place of birth and home town. The people knew from Micah 5:2 that the Christ would come from Bethlehem, but as far as they knew Jesus was born and raised in Galilee. They did not know that His mother brought Him forth in a lowly stable in the royal city of David.</p>
