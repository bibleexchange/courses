<h1>Chapter 17: He is The Great Intercessor</h1>
<p>This chapter is commonly referred to as “The High Priestly Prayer” of Christ because in it, Christ intercedes between God and man even as the Levitical priests in the Old Testament did. The main thought of this prayer, which is the longest recorded prayer of Jesus, is unity; Christ has interceded for mankind and has formed a bridge so that man can be one with God.</p>
<p>R. J. D. Utley said in The Beloved Disciple's Memoirs and Letters: The Gospel of John, I, II, and III John, “This chapter is difficult to divide into subjects because the same motifs are mentioned over and over again. This is like a tapestry of recurrent patterns. The key words are ‘glory,’ ‘give,’ ‘know,’ ‘sent,’ ‘name,’ ‘the world,’ and ‘one.’”</p>
<h2>Jesus Prayed for Himself 17:1-5</h2>
<p>The beginning section of this prayer is for Christ Himself. It is His desire that in this last hour of great tribulation that He would not follow His own will but that the will of the Father be done and that He would be glorified.</p>
<h3>Jesus lifted His eyes towards heaven 17:1a</h3>
<p>Jesus was not any less God than the Father was, but He aways has and always will operate in submission to Him. We see Him here lifting up His eyes towards heaven and He petitions the Father to work in this monumental hour.</p>
<h3>The hour is come 17:1b</h3>
<p>Jesus always operated according to the timeframe of God. We see from several verses in the book of John that the timing of the crucifixion was not haphazard but it was planned by God and known by Christ (John 2:4; 4:21; 7:30; 8:20; 13:1).</p>
<h3>This is life eternal 17:2, 3</h3>
<p>Knowing Jesus is not merely a part of life, but it is life (John 14:6; Phil. 1:21; I John 5:12). So often we allow God to move from the focus of our hearts and He is crowded out by religion and formality, but we need to keep the flame of His life burning in us everyday (II Cor. 4:16).</p>
<h3>The glory 17:4, 5</h3>
<p>This term “the glory” is one that has been very familiar to us as we have studied the book of John. It was used in the prologue when it says that, “We beheld His glory, the glory as the only begotten of the Father” (John 1:14). The word glory is used 12 times in John and variations of glorify are used 21 times.</p>
<p>To us, to glorify generally means to make great, but to Jesus it meant to reveal to humanity His greatness. Generally it speaks to us the manifestation of the divinity and power of Christ and it specifically speaks to us of the crucifixion. Christ always looked upon the cross as a means of glorifying God (John 12:23). Paul also saw glory in the cross (Gal. 6:14).</p>
<h2>Jesus Prayed for His Current Disciples 17:6-19</h2>
<p>While He began His prayer focused on Himself, He did not long remain there. We see that the majority of His prayer is for others. We can learn from His example and instead of always seeking for help for our own needs we should spend much of our prayer time interceding for the needs of others. Job found relief to his tribulation only when he prayed for his friends (Job 42:10).</p>
<p>This is not the only record we have of Jesus interceding for His disciples, for we see Him tell Peter in Luke 22:32 that He prayed for him. Even though He is no longer physically on this earth, He is still making intercession for His followers (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25).</p>
<h3>A prayer for protection 17:6-12</h3>
<p>Jesus recognized that the disciples had received and cherished the words that He had given them. He was confident that they now understood that the words He spoke were more than positive thinking or good philosophy, but they realized they were the words of God. Jesus wanted them to remain in this place of believing and trusting in God and He prayed that God would keep them after He physically left the world.</p>
<h3>A prayer for satisfaction 17:13-15</h3>
<h4>That they have joy 17:13</h4>
<h4>That they have the Word 17:14</h4>
<h4>That they might have peace 17:15</h4>
<p>Jesus did not pray that they would be taken out of this evil world, but that they would</p>
<p>have peace and be kept while they were in this world.</p>
<h3>A prayer for sanctification 17:16-19</h3>
<p>Jesus had a desire that they would come out of the world and be separated unto God and His service. The only way for the disciple to truly be sanctified, or set apart, is through the truth of the Word of God. It shows us the commandments of the Law, which tell us to separate from sin, and it tells us of the promises of grace and how we can be united with Him.</p>
<h2>Jesus Prayed for His Future Disciples 17:20-26</h2>
<p>Jesus knew that there would be more people that would become His followers besides the twelve disciples. There would be many other Jews that would see Him as the true Messiah. Moreover, soon many would realize that salvation was to the Gentile and not only the Jew and many would join the body of Christ. It is wonderful to think that while Jesus prayed that prayer that He looked ahead in time and prayed for us that live today!</p>
<h3>He prayed that they might be united 17:20, 21</h3>
<p>It has always been the plan and desire of God to have fellowship with man. He created Adam so that He could walk with him in the cool of the day and He still desires to share that union with us.</p>
<h3>He prayed how they would be united 17:22-26</h3>
<p>Being united with God is so much more than just proclaiming allegiance to Him, but every aspect of our lives must be intertwined with Him. As He closed His prayer, Jesus asked that our whole lives would be found in Him. We must remember that as we go through life that it is not our own ability and might that brings us victory, but it is the intercessory prayer and sacrificial death of Christ that keeps us spiritually well.</p>
<p>Jesus not only prayed that we would be united with Him and the Father, but that we would be united with each other. Many people that proclaim to be Christians cannot get along with other Christians. If we are going to be truly united with God, we must also be united with each other.</p>
<h4>In glory 17:22, 23</h4>
<p>The source of unity is God's glory, the very glory which Jesus Himself possessed.</p>
<p>It is the glory of God given to believers that unites believers and makes them one with Jesus</p>
<p>and His Father and one with each other. When believers experience the glory of God they</p>
<p>become one in character, and purpose.</p>
<h4>In position 17:24</h4>
<p>Jesus desired that we would be with Him where He was. To be united with Jesus we must truly follow in His steps and go where He goes. If we follow our own understanding we will find ourselves far from Him and disunited from God. We must not only follow in His example of well doing, but we must also be ready to suffer even as He suffered (Matthew 10:38).</p>
<h4>In knowledge 17:25</h4>
<h4>In love 17:26</h4>
<p>Our lives are not our own; It is His life in us. His life and love are given to us to help</p>
<p>love one another. </p>
