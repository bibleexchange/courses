<h1>Chapter 18: He is the Model Sufferer</h1>
<h2>Betrayal by Judas 18:1-11</h2>
<p>After Jesus finished praying, He led His disciples over the brook Cedron into the Garden of Gethsemane. This was not an unusual thing for Jesus to retreat here to pray with His disciples and this fact teaches us that we cannot just wait for the hard times to come before we pray, but we aways need to be praying (I Thess. 5:17).</p>
<h3>The arrest 18:1-9</h3>
<p>Because it was so predictable to find Jesus here that it was no problem for Judas to be able to lead the Jewish religious leaders to capture Him. There is no record in John of Judas conspiring with the Jews to betray Jesus, but we only see him leave the Last Supper when Jesus told him, “That thou doest, do quickly” (John 13:27) and now we see him come to betray his master.</p>
<p>John does not give any indication of how many men came with Judas, but we can see from Matthew 26:47 that it was a great multitude. It is strange that so many well armed soldiers came to attack a man that had been known for His peace; perhaps they were afraid that Jesus would escape from the midst of them as He did before (Luke 4:28-30; John 8:59) and they wanted to ensure the capture of their “foe.” We know that it was not their numbers or their weapons that enabled them to capture Jesus that day, but it was simply in the plan of God for it to happen, and so it did.</p>
<p>John gives an exclusive account of how that Jesus asked His attackers, “Whom seek ye?” They answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” When Jesus told them that He was the one they were seeking, then these men were knocked backward to the ground by the power of God. Probably out of amazement at the power manifested, they did not immediately approached Jesus to seize Him and so Jesus again asked them whom they sought. When they responded in the same manner as the first, Jesus reminded them that He clearly told them who He was and that they were planning to capture Him, then they should do so and let His disciples go free. Jesus always had the desire that His disciples should be kept in the midst of this trial as well as any other trial that they would fast later and that is why He prayed in John 17:11, 12 that the Father would keep them through His name.</p>
<h3>Peter’s resistance 18:10, 11</h3>
<p>At seeing this attack, Peter acted in impertinence and either somehow thought that he could take on this whole group of soldiers by himself or he figured that he would not go down without fighting and he took out his sword and cut off the ear of Malcus, who was a servant of the high priest.</p>
<p>Jesus clearly disapproved of this action and told Peter to put up his sword, and we see from Luke that Jesus healed the ear of this servant (Luke 22:51). Jesus told Peter that He needed to drink the cup that His Father had prepared for Him; He submissively drank the cup of woe pressed to His lips by the Father’s hand. Hebrews 5:8 “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;”</p>
<h2>Trial by the Jews 18:12-14, 19-24</h2>
<p>In the other three Gospels, we only have record of Jesus’ appearance before Caiaphas, but here in the book of John we have the singular account of Him appearing before Annas, who was the father in law of Caiaphas and who had previously been high priest. Besides these two Jewish hearings, we also know that Jesus was tried by Herod once and Pilate twice. Jesus was tossed about by the world. This is a tactic of men seeking help from others to disprove Jesus. Jesus’ life, doctrine and claims were cast back and forth in the minds of men who were seeking proof that He was not the Son of God.</p>
<p>There is some debate about whom the high priest is that is confronting Jesus in verses 19-23. If the translation of verse 24 is taken to be correct, then it is assumed that this conversation is with Caiaphas after, “Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.” If this is taken as true, then we have no details of what happened when Jesus was before Annas. Some believe that Annas did not even want to have a hearing with Jesus and immediately sent Him to his son in law. There are others that say the verse should have been more accurately translated, “Now Annas sent him...” and that this conversation was actually before Jesus went to Caiaphas. Since the content of these verses is unique to the book of John, then it is possible for it to be attributed to the man, Annas, who is also unique to the book. Either case is possible and who asked these questions to Jesus is not as important as what Jesus’ answers were.</p>
<p>From the other Gospels we see that Jesus was not alone before Caiaphas, but the Sanhedrin was also present (Matt. 26:57; Mark 14:53; Luke 22:66) and that they tried in vain to find two witnesses to agree against Him (Matthew 26:59-61; Mark 14:55-59). Though no two witnesses could agree, Caiaphas asked Jesus what He had to say about all the accusations, but Jesus did not give him an answer. Caiaphas then asked Him directly if He was the Son of God and Jesus told him that he spoke correctly and that He was the Son of God. Caiaphas was enraged at this and rent his garment. This was a part of the Jewish act of repentance (II Sam. 13:31; Ezra 9:5). He declared that because Jesus Himself proclaimed that He was the Son of God, which they thought to be an act of blasphemy, then they did not need any more witnesses. He then sent Jesus to Pilate to be judged by Roman law.</p>
<h2>Denial by Peter 18:15-18, 25-27</h2>
<p>Peter was so confident at the Last Supper that he would never deny Jesus and that he would even die following Him if that would be what it would take (John 14:36), but we see Peter so afraid that he would loose his life by being associated with Jesus that he was fearful of a little servant girl and he denied Jesus three times. The problem is that Peter was relying on his flesh and his own ability, which will always fail in the face of sever persecution (Job 8:13, 14). We can always be in the place of victory and success if we depend on the power of God (II Cor. 2:14).</p>
<h3>The first offense 18:15-18</h3>
<p>Peter and John followed Jesus from a distance. They watched the Jews bring Him to the house of the high priest. John apparently had some relation to the high priest and was granted entrance into the palace, but Peter waited until John went in and spoke to the young woman that kept the door. The girl recognized Peter and asked if he was one of Jesus’ disciples. Peter denied it and then joined some others as they warmed themselves around a fire.</p>
<h3>The second offense 18:25</h3>
<p>Matthew and Mark record that the next accusation against Peter was made by a woman, but Luke states that it was a man. This is likely because it was a group conversation among those around the fire and there were several people that made questions to Peter. John agrees with this theory by stating “they” instead of either a man or woman.</p>
<h3>The third offense 18:26, 27</h3>
<p>Peter could not cover his secret by his simple denials, for his accent was certainly that of a Galilaean. There was also a man present that was a relative of Malchus, whose ear Peter had cut off in the garden. Peter got angry because of all these people that recognized that he was one of the twelve. He was probably afraid that Caiaphas would hear of it and that he too would be tried and die along with Jesus. He was so angry that he began to curse and swear that he never even knew Jesus.</p>
<p>As soon as these curses had flown from Peter’s mouth, a sound was heard in the distance--it was the sound of the rooster crowing. Peter remembered the words that Jesus told him and how He prophesied that it would happen exactly like this. The thoughts were too much for him to bear and he ran out weeping bitterly (Luke 22:62). This was the same as the actions of Judas when he realized what he had done (Matt. 27:3, 4), but they went in separate directions after this initial weeping. Judas went out and hung himself (Matt. 27:5) but Peter went out and truly repented. There may be times when we make mistakes and fail God, but we should not give up for God has the power to restore us and help us get up again (Prov. 24:16).</p>
<h2>Trial by Pilate 18:28-40</h2>
<h3>Pilate tells the Jews to judge Him 18:28-32</h3>
<h3>Pilate questions Jesus 18:33-38a</h3>
<h3>Pilate gives the Jews the final choice 18:38b-40</h3>
<p>Pilate tried Jesus and found Him innocent – “I find in him no fault at all,” but Jesus</p>
<p>was tried by the circumstances and was found to be guilty of Love in the first degree.</p>
