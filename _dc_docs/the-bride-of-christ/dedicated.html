<h1><span lang="en">Dedicated</span></h1><p><span lang="en">First of all&#44; I dedicate this book to the Lord Jesus Christ who gave the vision and inspiration for the writing of the book. Also&#44; I would dedicate this to all that will read and reap from the truths that are presented in this book&#44; and to those whose lives will be changed and made ready for the marriage of the Lamb.</span></p>
