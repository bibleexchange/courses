<h1><span lang="en">Preface</span></h1><p><span lang="en">I have read that it has been said&#44; &quot;The book to write is the one that you would like to read and cannot find anywhere.&quot; One of the reasons for the writing of this book is the fact that I could not find one that presented these truths in a manner in which truth was not distorted. Many express men&#39;s opinions&#44; but it is my intent to express the truth itself. The primary reason for this book is that I believe God spoke to my spirit by HisSpirit to &quot;<i>write in a book the things&#44; which you have seen and heard.</i>&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">In this book I present to you the Truth as the Spirit of God revealed it to me through visions&#44; revelation&#44; study and information given tome by spirit-filled&#44; God-fearing people. The truth presented in this book is not the popular consensus of fundamental groups&#44; but is the only view that presents the truth in a consistent&#44; logical&#44; honest&#44; intelligent and comprehensible manner.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Beginning with the Reformation&#44; God began restoring &quot;<i>the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</i>&quot; That is&#44; the Faith which had been lost through tradition&#44; opinions and human ideas. Remember&#44; the Bible says&#44; &quot;<i>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them&#44; because they are spiritually discerned.</i>&quot; (I Cor. 2: 14) </span></p><p><span lang="en">Again&#44; the Bible says&#44; &quot;As it is written&#44; Eye hath not seen&#44;nor ear heard&#44; neither have entered into the heart of man&#44; the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us byHis Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things&#44; yea&#44; the deep things of God.&quot; (I Cor. 2: 9&#44; 10) This tenth verse in the Amplified NT reads&#44; &quot;Yet to us God has unveiled and revealed them by and through His Spirit&#44; for the (Holy) Spirit searches diligently&#44; exploring and examining everything&#44; even soundings the profound and bottomless things of God -- the divine counsels and things hidden and beyond man&#39;s scrutiny.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">Remember what Jesus said&#44; &quot;<i>If any man will do His will&#44;he shall know of the doctrine.</i>&quot; (Jn. 7: 17) There has to be obedience tothe truth already revealed to receive more truth.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Prov. 4: 18 &quot;The path of the just is as the shining light&#44;that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Several years ago&#44; while I was praying God gave me a vision. In the vision I saw a train moving rapidly through the night. While I was watching this vision&#44; I was trying to understand what God was saying tome. There was a night scene&#44; a fast moving train and a light shining out into the night. The Spirit spoke to me and said&#44; &quot;Watch the light.&quot; I was so taken up with trying to understand what God was saying to me by the vision of the train&#44;that I really did not grasp what the Spirit was saying. I watched the train as it raced through the night and came into a turn. As it began to make the turn&#44;the trees and grass were lit up along the tracks. The Spirit said again&#44;&quot;Watch the light.&quot; The train made the turn and headed down the track. I could see out into the night. The track was lit up by the light. Again&#44; the Spirit said&#44; &quot;Watch the light.&quot; Suddenly&#44; I saw the train slowing down and coming to a stop. When it stopped&#44; the Spirit said again&#44; &quot;Watch the light.&quot; Still I did not understand what God was trying to tell me. After a moment&#44; the train began to move again. As the big wheels on the engine began to move and the train began to move down the track&#44; the Spirit said again&#44; &quot;Watch the light.&quot; This time I was made to understand what the Spirit was saying. As the train moved&#44; the light moved. When the train stopped&#44; the light stopped.</span></p><p><span lang="en">We must move in the light that we have&#44; for God to give us more. If we stop moving on in the direction of the light (truth)&#44; the light will stop.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 6: 1 &quot;Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ&#44; 
<u>let us go on</u> unto perfection; not laying again the foundationof repentance from dead works&#44; and of faith toward God.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 4: 11--14  &quot;And he gave some&#44; apostles; and some&#44; prophets; and some&#44;evangelists; and some&#44; pastors and teachers; For the PERFECTING of the SAINTS&#44;for the work of the ministry&#44; for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith&#44; and of the knowledge of the Son of God&#44;UNTO A PERFECT MAN&#44; unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ: That we henceforth be no more children&#44; tossed to and fro&#44; and carried about with every wind of doctrine&#44; by the sleight of men&#44; and cunning craftiness&#44;whereby they lie in wait to deceive;&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">As we now approach this book&#44; I would admonish you to join your prayers with mine&#44; that God would grant you divine revelation and understanding. Without the inspiration and help of the Holy Spirit&#44; I question that you will understand the real meaning that is being presented in this book. There is much prejudice against the study and understanding of thisRevelation. I now endeavor to present the truths as God has given them to me&#44;earnestly praying God&#39;s blessing upon what is written and upon all those who read and desire to understand.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Rev.
