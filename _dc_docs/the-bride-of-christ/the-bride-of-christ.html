<h1><span lang="en">The Bride of Christ</span></h1><p><span lang="en">There is little knowledge among believers in this hour&#44;about the required scriptural qualifications to be a part of the overcoming company of believers that make up the Bride of Christ.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 7&#44; 8 &quot;Let us be glad and rejoice&#44; and give honour to Him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come&#44; and His wife hath made herself ready. And to herwas granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen&#44; clean and white: for thefine linen is the righteousness of saints.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">A Select Company of Believers </span></h2><h3><span lang="en">The Saved Are A Select Company</span></h3><p><span lang="en">The Saved are a company of people selected out of the world. Jesus said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Jn. 15: 16&#44; 19 &quot;Ye have not chosen Me&#44; but I have chosen you&#44; and ordained you&#44; that ye should go and bring forth fruit&#44; and that your fruit shouldremain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My name&#44; He may give ityou. If ye were of the world&#44; the world would love his own: but because ye arenot of the world&#44; but I have chosen you out of the world&#44; therefore the world hatethyou.&quot; </span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 1: 4 &quot;According as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world&#44; that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love:&quot;</span></blockquote><h3><span lang="en">The Church Is A Select Company</span></h3><p><span lang="en">The Church (the Body of Christ) is a company selected out of the Saved (the Born Again; the Family of God). The Church is not only the BornAgain&#44; but rather the Born Again believers who have been filled with the HolyGhost.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 12: 13 &quot;For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Church is not only born of the Spirit but also baptized with the Spirit. As on the Day of Pentecost&#44; the Church is filled with theSpirit proven by the sign evidence of speaking in tongues. Proof of this is inthe fact that four of the five places where believers were filled with the HolySpirit in Scripture states they spoke with tongues.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Acts 2: 4 &quot;And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost&#44; and began to speak with other tongues&#44; as the Spirit gave them utterance.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Acts 10: 45&#44; 46 &quot;And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished&#44; as many as came with Peter&#44; because that on the Gentiles also waspoured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues&#44;and magnify God...&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Acts 19: 6 &quot;And when Paul had laid his hands upon them&#44; the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues&#44; and prophesied.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 14: 18 &quot;I thank my God&#44; I speak with tongues more than ye all:&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The one place it does not say they spoke with tongues is inActs 8: 17. However&#44; Simon the sorcerer was willing to give money to have thepower to give the Holy Ghost to whomsoever he laid his hands on. Simon had tohave seen something very supernatural to be willing to give his money for whathe saw happen when the Apostles laid their hands on the people. (Acts 8: 18&#44; 19) Without question&#44; Simon saw them speak in tongues and glorify God as in theother places that speak of receiving the Holy Spirit.</span></p><h3><span lang="en">The Bride Is A Select Company</span></h3><p><span lang="en">The Bride of Christ is a company selected out of the Church&#44;the Body of Christ. Nowhere in the Bible is the Church called the Bride. Nowhere in the Scripture is Christ called the Husband of the Church. Instead&#44;the reference is to the fact that He is the Head of the Church. The Church isHis Body. The Bride will be a select company chosen out of the Church (theBody of Christ).</span></p><p><span lang="en">Jesus said in Matt. 20: 23&#44; &quot;...To sit on My right hand&#44; and on My left&#44; is not Mine to give&#44; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of My Father.&quot; The Father makes the 
<u>choice</u> of those that will sit with Him (the Son).</span></p><h2><span lang="en">A Prepared Company of Believers</span></h2><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 7 &quot;Let us be glad and rejoice&#44; and give honour to Him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come&#44; and His wife hath made herself ready.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">&quot;Hetoimazo&quot; -- &quot;Made&quot; -- to prepare -- make ready</span></p><h3><span lang="en">Prepared by the Revelation of the Word</span></h3><p><span lang="en">The Bride will make herself ready by the revelation of God&#39;sWord (revealed by the Spirit). She will apprehend every redemptive right theLord has made available to every believer that hath an ear to hear what theSpirit has to say to the churches. The sad thing is that not everyone willlisten.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 20 &quot;Behold&#44; I stand at the door&#44; and knock...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This letter is to a Church that has become lukewarm. TheLord is outside knocking. &quot;<i>...If any man hear My voice&#44; </i>(the revealedWord)<i> and open the door...</i>&quot; He is no longer addressing the whole Church&#44;but now He calls to individuals.  &quot;<i>...If any man...</i>&quot; that is in the Churchwill hear His voice&#44; answer the call&#44; open the door and let Him in&#44; Jesus said&#44;&quot;<i>...I will come in to him...</i>&quot; The idea is that He not only comes in&#44; but &quot;<i>...into him&#44; and will sup with him&#44; and he with Me.</i>&quot; The evening meal is theprincipal meal&#44; the chief meal of the day&#44; and the time when they eat meat andhearty foods. The Lord is saying that He wants to come in and share meat(Revelation of the Word) to develop the overcoming life in you&#44; that isrequired to sit with Him on His Throne.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 21 &quot;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in MyThrone...&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 24: 45 &quot;...To give them meat in due season.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This meat is revelation out of the Word by the Spirit&#44; notapart from the Word&#44; but out of the Word.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 24: 28 &quot;For wheresoever the carcase is&#44; there will the eagles begathered together.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Eagles do not eat carrion&#44; they eat fresh slain meat. Eaglesaints eat fresh revelation of truth. The Bride of Christ will make herselfready by eating the fresh revelation that God has&#44; and is revealing to her. InRev. 2: 17 the Lord said&#44; &quot;<i>...To him that overcometh will I give to eat of thehidden </i>(krupto -- kept secret)<i> manna...</i>&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">Paul said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 2: 9&#44; 10  &quot;But as it is written&#44; Eye hath not seen&#44; nor ear heard&#44;neither have entered into the heart of man&#44; the things which God hath preparedfor them that love Him.

This is righteousness acquired through appropriation by faith&#44; and through application of the truth by grace.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 4: 13 &quot;Till we all come in the unity of the faith&#44; and of theknowledge of the Son of God&#44; <b>unto a perfect man</b>&#44; unto the measure of thestature of the fulness of Christ:&quot;</span></blockquote><h3><span lang="en">The Bride will Run to Gain the Prize</span></h3><p><span lang="en">Not everyone will run&#44; for most have been taught that theyhave been given everything by grace and there is no need to exercise energy togain the prize. Salvation is a gift that can not be earned. This is a prizethat is only earned by running&#44; and not by running only&#44; but running accordingto the rules to win the prize. Therefore&#44; there are conditions that have to bemet in order to win.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 9: 24 &quot;Know ye not that they which run in a race run all&#44; but onereceiveth the prize?

To be an overcomer something has to be overcome. There are forces that will fight against thebeliever&#44; and for the believer to be an overcomer they must fight to keep whathas been given to them by grace. This is a fight of faith.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">II Cor. 10: 4 &quot;(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal&#44; but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 6: 12&#44; 13 &quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood&#44; but against principalities&#44; against powers&#44; against the rulers of the darkness of this world&#44; against spiritual wickedness in high places.

There has to be a connection between the character of those who profess Christ asLord&#44; and those who adorn themselves in a suitable life-style that pleases theLord. Like Enoch of old &quot;<i>...before his translation he had this testimony&#44;that he pleased God.</i>&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 7: 21 &quot;Not every one that saith unto Me&#44; Lord&#44; Lord&#44; shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Titus 1: 16 &quot;They profess that they know God; but in works they deny Him&#44;being abominable&#44; and disobedient&#44; and unto every good work reprobate.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Jas. 1: 22 &quot;But be ye doers of the Word&#44; and not hearers only&#44; deceiving your own selves.&quot;</span></blockquote><h3><span lang="en">The Bride will Make no Provision for the Flesh</span></h3><p><span lang="en">Flesh struggles desperately hard to survive in the best of men&#44; but with the help of the Holy Spirit the flesh can&#44; and will be overcome.

They were all wrapped-upin material goods; rich in earthly things&#44; but poor in spiritual things. Hiscounsel was to buy of Him spiritual wealth&#44; defined as &quot;<i>...Gold tried in thefire...</i>&quot; which is the very nature of God.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">II Pet. 1: 4 &quot;Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and preciouspromises: that by these ye might be partakers of the Divine Nature...&quot;</span></blockquote><h3><span lang="en">The Third Thing to Overcome is the Ignorance of Their Condition</span></h3><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 17 &quot;...And knowest not that thou art wretched&#44; and miserable...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Lord says they are &quot;<i>blind</i>&quot; to their condition. Therefore&#44; this requires a truthful and strict examination of ourselves. Paul said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">II Cor. 13: 5 &quot;Examine yourselves&#44; whether ye be in the faith; prove yourown selves.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Jesus said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Jn. 8: 32 &quot;...Ye shall know the truth&#44; and the truth shall make you free.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Lord&#39;s counsel was to &quot;<i>...anoint thine eyes with eyesalve&#44; that thou mayest see...</i>&quot; (Rev. 3: 18) The eyes must be anointed by the Holy Spirit with spiritual insight and revelations to not only see the &quot;<i>blind</i>&quot;condition&#44; but to see the provisions made for this condition.
