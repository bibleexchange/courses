That fact is that the <b>highest position of honor</b> is a reward for spiritual attainment and a Christ-like character.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 4: 13 &quot;Till we all come in the unity of the faith&#44; and of theknowledge of the Son of God&#44; unto a perfect man&#44; unto the measure of thestature of the fullness of Christ:&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 10 &quot;Because thou hast kept the Word of My patience&#44; I also willkeep thee from the hour of temptation&#44; which shall come upon all the world&#44; totry them that dwell upon the earth.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 21  &quot;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in MyThrone&#44; even as I also overcame<b>...<b>&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 7&#44; 8  &quot;Let us be glad and rejoice&#44; and give honour to Him: for the<b><b>marriage of the Lamb is come&#44; and Hiswife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted (given) that she shouldbe arrayed in fine linen&#44; clean&#44; and white: for the fine linen is therighteousness (righteous acts) of saints.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">The Body of Christ is The Church</span></h2><p><span lang="en">No where in the Word of God is the Church ever called theBride of Christ. This is simply assumed by men to be the meaning&#44; but there is no Scripture to support this theory. However&#44; repeatedly throughout theScripture the Church is called the Body of Christ. In this text&#44; Eph. 1: 22&#44; 23&#44; Christ&#39;s position is shown as the Head of the Church (which is His body). Thefifth chapter is the chapter&#44; the one chapter&#44; that they love to use in tryingto prove the Church to be the Bride of Christ. However&#44; if you will read itcarefully and honestly&#44; there is no reference to the Church as His Bride. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 5: 23 &quot;For the husband is the head of the wife&#44; even as Christ is theHead of the Church: and He is the Savior of the Body.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 5: 30 &quot;For we are members of His Body&#44; of His flesh&#44; and of Hisbones.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Scofield said&#44; &quot;Eve&#44; taken from Adam&#39;s body was truly boneof his bones&#44; and flesh of his flesh&#44; but she was also his wife.&quot; He says thisis &quot;...a clear type of the Church as the Bride of Christ.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">However&#44; when studying the Scripture and analyzing it&#44; byputting its parts into proper perspective&#44; the flaws are seen in this theory of making the Body to be the Bride.</span></p><p><span lang="en">First&#44; Eve was taken out the body of Adam&#44; but not untilafter his body had been completed. Therefore&#44; in fulfillment of this type theBride will not be taken out of the Church until the latter part of the Churchage&#44; which we are now in. </span></p><p><span lang="en">Secondly&#44; Eve was formed from a very small part of Adam&#39;sbody&#44; only a &quot;<i>rib</i>&#44;&quot; not the whole body. From that &quot;<i>rib</i>&quot; out ofAdam&#39;s body&#44; God formed a bride for Adam. </span></p><p><span lang="en">Thirdly&#44; Eve then existed apart from the rest of the body asa separate entity.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Lastly&#44; Eve was &quot;<i>bone of his bone</i>.&quot; However&#44; she wasnot all of his bones as Scofield&#39;s theory requires. After God took the &quot;<i>rib</i>&quot;and made Eve&#44; Adam awoke out of sleep and retained all his bones except onerib. It is very difficult&#44; in fact totally impossible&#44; to make Eve&#44; a &quot;<i>rib</i>&#44;&quot;to be the whole body of Adam. This is what you would have to do to make Eve(the type of the Bride of Christ) the type of the whole Church.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">The Church as a Whole is Lukewarm</span></h2><p><span lang="en">The Lord Jesus Himself stated that the Church is not fervent&#44; nor on fire&#44; nor overcoming but is in a state of lukewarmness.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 15&#44; 16 &quot;I know thy works&#44; that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art<b><b>lukewarm&#44; and neither cold nor hot&#44; (in a state of satisfaction and also astate of comfort) I will spue thee out of My mouth.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Church as a whole&#44; in this state of &quot;<i>lukewarmness&#44;</i>&quot;is not a fit example of an Overcomer ready to sit with Christ on His Throne. Jesus said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 17&#44; 18 &quot;Because thou sayest&#44; I am rich&#44; and increased with goods&#44;and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched&#44; andmiserable&#44; and poor&#44; and blind&#44; and naked: I counsel thee to buy of Me goldtried in the fire (there is a price for the gold&#44; it will cost you something)&#44;that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment&#44; that thou mayest be clothed&#44; andthat <b>the shame of thy nakedness<b> (spiritual nakedness before God) do notappear&#44; and anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see.&quot; </span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Church needs the &quot;<i>eye salve</i>&quot; of the Holy Spirit applied to its eyes to see its own condition. This &quot;<i>eye salve</i>&quot; of theHoly Spirit is also needed to see the revelations that God is making known tothose who love Him.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 2: 9&#44; 10  &quot;...Eye hath not seen&#44; nor ear heard&#44; neither have entered into the heart of man&#44; the things which God hath prepared for them that loveHim. But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spiritsearcheth all things&#44; yea&#44; the deep (hidden-mysteries) things of God.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 2: 17  &quot;...To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna...&quot; (covered -- concealed -- kept secret)</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">God has promised to reveal His truths to the Overcomer that cannot be understood by the natural mind. These truths must be&#44; and can onlybe&#44; revealed by His Spirit.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">The Church Has Been Deceived</span></h2><p><span lang="en">Jesus said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 24: 11&#44; 12 &quot;And many false prophets shall rise&#44; and shall deceive<b><b>many. And because iniquity shall abound&#44; the love of many shall wax cold.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">II Thes. 2: 3  &quot;Let no man deceive you by any means: for thatday shall not come&#44; except there come a falling away first...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">&quot;Apostasia&quot;-- &quot;falling away&quot; -- defection from truth -- toforsake the truth -- revolt</span></p><p><span lang="en">This is not a falling away in numbers&#44; but a falling away inprinciples. They are defecting from the truth once delivered to them.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Tim. 4: 1 &quot;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly&#44; that in the latter timessome shall depart from the faith&#44; giving heed to seducingspirits&#44; and doctrines of devils;&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">II Tim. 4: 3&#44; 4  &quot;For the time will come when they will not endure sounddoctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers&#44;having itching ears; And they shall turn away their<b><b>ears from the truth&#44; and shall be turned unto fables.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">&quot;Muthos&quot; -- &quot;fable&quot; -- fiction -- in which there isfalsification of facts.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Christ is knocking at the Church&#39;s door. (Rev. 3: 20) The 
<u>whole</u>Church will not respond. He now speaks to the individual that will hear His knocking (responds to His Word) and open the door (the door to his inner life --to his heart). He said&#44; &quot;<i>I will come in to him and will sup with him&#44; and he with Me.</i>&quot; Christ will share truth.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">The Church has Many Undeveloped Believers</span></h2><p><span lang="en">Some believers accepted Christ as their Savior and were born into the Family of God&#44; but they have never developed. They are still babes. They have never grown in their experience.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 3: 1--3  &quot;And I&#44; brethren&#44; could not speak unto you as unto spiritual&#44; but as unto carnal&#44; even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed youwith milk&#44; and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it&#44; neitheryet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among youenvying&#44; and strife&#44; and divisions&#44; are ye not carnal&#44; and walk as men.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Gal. 4: 1--3 &quot;Now I say&#44; that the heir&#44; as long as he is a child&#44; differeth nothing from a servant&#44; though he be lord of all. But is under tutors andgovernors until the time appointed of the father. Even so we&#44; when we werechildren&#44; were in bondage under the elements of the world:&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 4: 14 &quot; That we henceforth be no more children&#44; tossed to and fro&#44;and carried about with every wind of doctrine&#44; by the sleight of men&#44; andcunning craftiness&#44; whereby they lie in wait to deceive;&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 5: 11-- 6: 1 &quot;Of whom we have many things to say&#44; and hard to beuttered&#44; seeing ye are dull of hearing. For when for the time ye ought to beteachers&#44; ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principlesof the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk&#44; and not ofstrong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskillful in the Word ofrighteousness: for he is a babe. But strong meat belongeth to them that are offull age&#44; even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised todiscern both good and evil. Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrineof Christ&#44; let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation ofrepentance from dead works&#44; and of faith toward God.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">Some in The Church will be Saved as By Fire</span></h2><p><span lang="en">Not everyone that is in the Church is willing to do what isrequired to have an abundant entrance into the kingdom of God. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">II Peter 1: 10&#44; 11  &quot;Wherefore the rather&#44; brethren&#44; give diligence to makeyour calling and election sure: for if ye do these things&#44;ye shall never fall: For so an entrance shall be ministered unto youabundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">As Paul said in I Cor. 3: 12&#44; there are many that are building on the foundation that has been laid&#44; &quot;<i>wood&#44; hay&#44; stubble.</i>&quot; Hegoes on to say:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 3: 13--15 &quot;Every man&#39;s work shall be made manifest: for the dayshall declare it&#44; because it shall be revealed by fire: and the fire shall tryevery man&#39;s work of what sort it is. If any man&#39;s work abide which he hathbuilt thereupon&#44; he shall receive a reward. If any man&#39;s work shall be burned&#44;he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.&quot; </span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">Some in The Church have Committed Spiritual Adultery</span></h2><p><span lang="en">The believer is admonished by the Word of God to &quot;...come out from among them&#44; and be ye separate... and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you... saith the Lord...&quot; (II Cor. 6: 17&#44; 18)</span></p><p><span lang="en">James says:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Jas. 4: 4 &quot;Ye adulterers and adulteresses&#44; know ye not that the friendshipof the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of theworld is the enemy of God?&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">I Jn. 2: 15&#44; 16 &quot;Love not the world&#44; neither the things that are in theworld. If any man love the world&#44; the love of the Father is not in him. Forall that is in the world&#44; the lust of the flesh&#44; and the lust of the eyes&#44; andthe pride of life&#44; is not of the Father&#44; but is of the world.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">The Church will be Invited To the Marriage Supper</span></h2><p><span lang="en">The Lord will return at the midnight hour (the middle of the Tribulation hour) to Rapture the Church and welcome them to the MarriageFeast. The five wise &quot;<i>virgins</i>&quot; represent the Church that will awake out of sleep&#44; through the persecution of the first three-and-a-half years of theTribulation&#44; and will be invited to the Marriage Feast. Luke 12: 36-38 says the Lord will return <b>
<u>after</u></b> the wedding; the Church will be madeto sit down and the Lord Himself will come forth and serve them. Again in Rev.19: 9&#44; &quot;<i>And he saith unto me&#44; Write&#44; Blessed are they which are called unto the Marriage Supper of the Lamb...</i>&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">There is nothing in this world worth the loss of the soul and missing out on salvation. Neither the fleshly entertainment&#44; nor earthly pleasure could be worth spending an eternity without God in an eternal hell ofsuffering.</span></p><p><span lang="en">There is nothing worth missing the Rapture of the Church&#44; by which the Church will escape the last three-and-a-half years of theTribulation. This is known in the Scripture as the Great Tribulation&#44; which isthe time of the releasing of God&#39;s judgments on the earth. This includes the opening of the Seals&#44; the sounding of the Trumpets&#44; the releasing of the Vials&#44;and even the Thunders that John was told not to record. Most believe thesejudgments cover the whole seven years. They are very wrong&#44; for the Seals are not opened until after the Church has been Raptured in the middle of theTribulation and is seen around the Throne.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 5: 6 &quot;And I beheld&#44; and&#44; lo&#44; in the midst of the Throne and of the four beasts&#44; and in the midst of the elders&#44; stood a Lamb as it had been slain&#44;having seven horns and seven eyes&#44; which are the seven Spirits of God sentforth into all the earth.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Furthermore&#44; there is nothing in this whole world worth missing the Translation of the Bride of Christ. She will not only escape the seven years of Tribulation&#44; but will be honored in the Marriage of the Lamb asHis wife&#44; and will be seated with Him on His Throne. (Rev. 3: 21)</span></p><p><span lang="en">Remember&#44; Peter said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Pet. 4: 17 &quot;...Judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begins at us&#44; what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 11: 31 &quot;For if we would judge ourselves&#44; we should not be judged.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Only the Bride (the Overcomer) will judge herself by theWord&#44; and make herself ready. (Rev. 19: 7&#44; 8)</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Church will be judged by persecution in the first three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. The Saved (the Born Again; the Family of God) has allowed their garments to become spotted by the world andthe flesh&#44; and failed to repent under the persecution the Church endured. TheSaved will be judged in The Great Tribulation (the last three-and-a-half years). The Scripture states they will make their robes white by washing themin the Blood of the Lamb.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 7: 9&#44; 13&#44; 14 &quot;After this I beheld&#44; and&#44; lo&#44; a great multitude&#44; whichno man could number&#44; of all nations&#44; and kindreds&#44; and people&#44; and tongues&#44;stood before the Throne&#44; and before the Lamb&#44; clothed with white robes&#44; andpalms in their hands...
