<h1><span lang="en">Inspiration: Declarations</span></h1> 
<h2>The entire Bible is inspired of God.</h2>
<blockquote>II Timothy3:16--All scripture is given by inspiration of Godâ€¦</blockquote>
<p><b>The view that the Bible in its entirety is inspired of God is called plenary inspiration.</b>Plenary means full or complete. The Complete Bible from Genesis to Revelation is the inspired Word of God. All Scripture is equally inspired.</p>
<p>Because it is inspired of God,the Bible is infallible. Infallible means to be totally exempt from the possibility of mistake. This word is applied to God who is not capable of error or mistake. Used in reference to the Bible, infallible refers to theDivine Authorship of Scripture. The Divine Author is infallible and thereforeHis Word is infallible.</p>
<h2>TheOld Testament is inspired by God.</h2>
<p>Over and over again we can find the following phrases in the Old Testament:</p>
<p>"Word of the Lord"</p>
<p>"God said/spake"</p>
<p>"God commanded"</p>
<p> "God appeared"</p>
<p>"the Lord said/spake"</p>
<p>"thus saith the Lord"</p>
<p>These phrases affirm the inspiration of the Old Testament. The validity of these claims of inspiration is evident from the minuteness and detail as to names, times, and places which characterized their messages, and from the exact literal fulfillment of their prophecies.</p>
<blockquote>Acts 28:25--And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</blockquote>
<blockquote>2 Peter 1:21--For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hebrews 1:1--God,who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dt.18:18-22--v.22 <b>When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not,nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.</b></blockquote>
<h2>TheNew Testament is inspired by God</h2>
<p>The writers of the NT claim inspiration for OT writers as well as for themselves:</p>
<blockquote>Acts 1:16--â€¦this scripture must needs have been fulfilled,which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus..,</blockquote>
<h2>The Men were Inspired</h2>
<p> The Scripture declares that Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. -- 2 Peter 1:21 God breathed His Word through the men that were the human instruments to write the Bible. The prophet"s spoken words from God were used by God to communicate with His people. The Lord instructed many of these men to write down His Words. The men were inspired and instructed by God to give His Word to the people.</p>
<p>1 Thessalonians2:13; John 6:63; Eph. 3:8-9</p>
<h2>The Words were Inspired</h2>
<p>Not only were the men inspired by God, but the very choice of words came straight from the throne of God. God inspired the choice of the words of Scripture.<b> This is referred to as verbal inspiration.</b> The writers were not left absolutely to themselves in the choice of words that they should use. God guided the very wording of the Bible.</p>

<blockquote>Jude 17--But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of ourLord Jesus Christ;</blockquote>
<blockquote>2 Peter 3:2--That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets,and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour</blockquote>
<blockquote>John 12:48--He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</blockquote>
<h2>The Letters were Inspired</h2>
<p>The very letters of the words of the Bible are Divinely inspired. For example, let us look at the doctrine of"one seed and not many" through Christ which is established by the use of a single letter: "s."</p>
<blockquote>Galatians 3:16--Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.[comp. Gen.22:16-18]</blockquote>

<p>The "s" in this verse makes ALL the difference. The "s" makes the difference between singularity and plurality and most important the difference of stating that there is one mediator or stating there are many mediators. Had God said "seeds" instead of "seed" the promises could have come through Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed, the Pope or anyone else that chose this claim of fame. By definite use of singularity, God closes the door on false messengers and exalts Christ as the ONLY way to God. The promised seed could only be Christ and not Christ and Buddha or Christ and Mohammed. Jesus Christ alone was and is the promised seed.</p>

<h2>Every Iota was Inspired</h2>
<blockquote>Matthew 5:18--For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</blockquote>
<p>A jot could be equalled by an apostrophe (') and a tittle equalled by a hyphen (-).</p>
<p>"The Bible is none other than the voice of Him that sitteth on the throne. Every book of it, every chapter, every verse, every word, every syllable, every letter is the direct utterance of TheMost High."--Dan Burgon</p>
