 <h1><span lang="en">Inspiration: Definite Proofs</span></h1> 
<p>There are crystal clear proofs of the inspiration of the Bible. Besides the declarations of the text itself, multitudes of Biblical facts indicate that Scripture was Divinely inspired.</p>
<h2>Its Unbroken and Perfect Unity</h2>
<p>The Bible contains 66 books written by approximately 40 different men in four languages spanning a period of 1600 years, by men living as far as 1500 miles apart. The men used were from all walks of life; they were kings, doctors,prophets, shepherds, servants, fisherman, and even a tax collector. Yet there is unbroken and perfect unity throughout the entire Bible. This could only be the work of God.</p>
<h2>Its Fearless Foretelling</h2>
<p> The Bible foretells events many years and even centuries before they took place. The timing of the writing of the Old Testament prophecies can be historically documented because an accurate record of the history between theTestaments has survived. This historical record confirms the date of the ending of the Old Testament placing a four hundred year biblical silence between the last of O.T. prophecy and the start of N.T. fulfillments. The dates when the Bible books were written can be historically documented. TheSeptuagint, which is a Greek translation of the Old Testament, can be accurately placed at least two-hundred and fifty years before the birth ofChrist. Since the Greek Septuagint was translated from the Hebrew text there had to have been the Hebrew Old Testament in existence at least two-hundred and fifty years before the New Testament. This is historical proof that these prophecies were written hundreds of years in advance of their detailed fulfillment in the New Testament. There is no possible way that man could have made such accurate predictions. This is a definite and inarguable proof of theInspiration of Scripture.</p>
<p>EXAMPLES OF ACCURATELY FULFILLED PROPHECY:</p>
<h3>The Prophecies of Christ</h3>
<p>He would be of the seed of Abraham -- Gen. 22:18 -- Mt. 1:1</p>
<p>He would be a descendant of David -- Jer. 23:5 -- Mt. 1:1</p>
<p>He would come from the tribe of Judah -- Micah 5:2 -- Mt. 1:2, Heb. 7:14</p>
<p>He would be born in Bethlehem -- Micah 5:2 -- Mt. 2:1</p>
<p>There were 29 prophesies fulfilled in one day during the events of the crucifixion ofJesus which were accurately predicted in great detail centuries before His death.</p>
<p>There are over 300 Messianic prophecies that were fulfilled in Christ.</p>
<blockquote>Acts 3:18--But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</blockquote>
<p>Jesus fulfilled all the O.T. prophecies concerning Him despite improbability. No man is able to choose his lineage before he is born, yetJesus was born exactly according to the lineage as prophesied. There were other people involved in the fulfillments of these prophecies such as the Roman soldiers who parted Jesus garments among them and cast lots for His robe. Even the darkness that took place at the death of Christ can be historically documented and verified. The prophet Amos foretold of this darkness approximately 700 years before it occurred. There is no human explanation as to the accurate fulfillment of these Messianic prophecies. <b>This is a clear proof of the inspiration of the Bible!</b></p>
<h3>The Prophecies of Israel</h3>
<p>Moses prophesied of the future of Israel. -- Deut. 4:23-38.</p>
<p>They would become captives because of their sin. --Is. 22:17, Jer.20:6.</p>
<p>They would be scattered into all lands. -- Deut. 30:1-3.</p>
<p>They would be persecuted. -- Lk. 19:41-44.</p>
<p>Preceding the time of Christ"s return, Israel would be gathered again to her own land. (Luke 21:29-32; Eze. 36-37) This was fulfilled May 14,1948.</p>
<p>Ezekiel 36:24--For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.</p>
<p>God stated that He would watch over the people of Israel like a shepherd (Jeremiah 31:10). Less than 24 hours after Israel declared independence in 1948, its surrounding countries (Egypt,Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon) attacked Israel, hoping to replace the Jewish state with an Arab state. These countries are much larger than Israel, but tinyIsrael prevailed in that war and was able to capture additional land! Israel also prevailed in two other major wars that followed (Six-Day War, 1967 and YomKippur War, 1973).</p>

<h3>The Prophecies of Nations</h3>
<p>Babylon was overthrown and brought down like Sodom as prophesied (Isa. 13:19; Jer.51:37). Daniel 5 describes the transfer of power to the Medes and Persians.</p>
<p>The Grecian Empire was the third kingdom described in the prophetic dream in Daniel2:39 with Babylon being the first Kingdom. Alexander the Great conquered the world exactly as was foretold in this prophecy. (This prophetic dream is studied in depth in the 3rd year Prophecy course.)</p>
<p>The division of the Roman Empire is also foretold in the division of the legs of the same image in Nebuchadnezzar"s dream in Daniel 2.</p>
<p>Nineveh was laid waste by fierce nomadic peoples. Nahum (1-3, 3:7) foretold that the gates would be set wide open to thine enemies (3:13). The Tigris river flooded at the time of the attack and washed away much of the walls including the gates of the city.</p>
<p>Tyre was to be destroyed according to Ezekiel 26:3-14. This is a very specific prophecy given approximately 588 BC. The Scripture declares that many nations would come against Tyre. v. 3. God said he would bring the king of Babylon against them. v.7. The prophecy states that the stones, the timber and the dust would be cast into the water. v. 12. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did lay siege to Tyre for thirteen years. Alexander the Great took the city ofTyre on the Island in 332 BC by building a land bridge to the Island. They used stones, timber from the destroyed buildings and earthen fill to make what is called a mole (earthen bridge) in the water. The soldiers put the stones,timber, and dust into the water exactly according to the prophecy. This specific fulfilled event is beyond the mere speculation of man. The Bible is the inspired Word of God. The mole of Alexander the Great is still in existence today.</p>
<p>Jesus foretold of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. -- Mt. 24:1-2, Mk.13:1-3. The city of Jerusalem was destroyed in AD 70 under the Roman GeneralTitus. The temple was burned and the gold melted between the stones. The soldiers literally took apart the Temple stone by stone to retrieve the gold. Again the prophecy was fulfilled in detail exactly as Jesus said it would be.</p>
<h3>The Prophecies of the Last Days</h3>
<p>2Timothy 3:1-9--v. 1 This know also, that in the last daysâ€¦</p>

<p> There are numerous accurate descriptions of the last days found inScripture. These are just some of the prophecies that describe the condition of our day:</p>
<p>An increase of knowledge -- Dan. 12:4</p>
<p> Think of all the new innovations that have taken place within the last one hundred years. The Wright brothers " first flight was in 1903 and today air travel is a common mode of transportation. There has been so much advancement in technology in a very short time.</p>
<p>Many false prophets -- Mt. 24:5,11</p>
<p>Wars and rumors of wars -- Mt. 24:6</p>
<p>Famines, pestilences and earthquakes -- Mt. 24:7</p>
<p>Iniquity shall abound -- Mt. 24:12</p>
<p>Gospel preached in the entire the world -- Mt. 24:14</p>
<p>Eating, drinking and marrying -- Mt. 24:38</p>
<p>As it was in the days of Lot -- Luke 17: 28-29</p>
<p>(They drank, bought, sold, planted and built. This sounds a lot like the people today. There is also a rise of the sin of homosexuality today as it was in the days of Lot.)</p>
<p>A departing from the faith -- I Tim. 4:1</p>

<h2>Its Historical Accuracy</h2>

<p>Archaeology is about learning about the past by finding things that were used by ancient peoples. These ancient artifacts tell us information about the people that used them. There have been many archaeological finds that support the historical accuracy of the Bible. As a matter of fact, no archaeological find has yet to contradict the Bible. Critics have argued that the Bible is not historically accurate, yet archaeology continues to validate the Bible as true.</p>
<p>A Hittite library was discovered in Turkey in 1906 confirming the accuracy of the Biblical record of the Hittite people.</p>
<p>There have been skeletons found of giant people confirming the description of giants in the Bible.</p>
<p>The remains of a crucifixion victim were found in Jerusalem in 1968. The victim"s feet had one nail hole that penetrated through both feet and one nail hole in each of the lower arms. The man was believed to have been executed by the Romans in the Jewish uprising of AD 70. This confirms that crucifixion was indeed a means of execution used by the Romans as described in the Biblical account of the crucifixion of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Book of Acts has been confirmed to be historically accurate.</p>
<p>There have been inscriptions found containing the names of people described in the Bible in the locations the Bible places the people in.</p>
<p>There have been many archaeological finds that continue to confirm the historical accuracy of the Bible. This is more evidence that testifies to the inspiration of Scripture.</p>
<h2>Its Scientific Accuracy</h2>

<p>The Bible is scientifically accurate. There are things described in theBible that the men that wrote them would have no way of knowing. God is the author of Scripture and knows all things.</p>
<p>The descriptions in the Bible are true and scientifically accurate.</p>
<p>The dimensions of Noah"s Ark given to Noah by God are in perfect proportion for a most seaworthy vessel. Modern vessels that have been designed with advanced understanding of physics and the use of computer technology use the same proportions that Noah did. There is no way that Noah could have had access to this knowledge. The only logical conclusion is to believe theBiblical account that God give these dimensions to Noah.</p>
<p>The book of Job refers to the parting of light. Job 38:24 Light can be separated into parts with a prism. There is no way that Job which is the oldest book in the Bible could have known that light can be divided.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes refers to the circuits of the wind. There are wind currents and patterns that have been discovered by modern science with the aid of satellites and computers. The men of the O.T. times would not have had access to such information, yet again the Bible accurately refers to the circuits of the wind.</p>
<p>How did the writer of Ecclesiastes know that the rivers run into the sea.--Eccl. 1:7</p>
<p>Isaiah spoke of God sitting upon the circle of the earth. Is. 40:22. The earth was not proven to be round until Magellan"s expedition sailed around the world in the 1500"s. Isaiah did not have access to such information. This again is a testimony to the Inspiration of Scripture.</p>

<h2>Its Peerless Power</h2>

<p>Romans 1:16--For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
<p>The Bible is more than just a book. The Bible is the Word of God. TheBible was written by Holy men of God moved upon by the Holy Ghost. The Bible is to be understood by the Holy Ghost moving upon you. Those who earnestly read the Bible in faith can be changed by the power of God. God can use the Bible to change men"s lives. Many lives have been changed by the power of God by simply reading and believing the Bible.</p>
<p>The Bible has power to save people from all walks of life: drunkards, drug addicts, prostitutes, thieves, murderers, all sinners. All can be saved throughJesus Christ. Without exception, counsel and direction for every situation of life can be found in the Word of God. Unequalled and unrivalled, the Bible stands prominently above any and all other written works. Simply, the Bible is the only book God moved upon man to write for a pattern for eternity.</p>
