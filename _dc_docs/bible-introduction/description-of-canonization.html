	<h1><span lang="en">Description of Canonization</span></h1>
	<h2>The Old Testament Canon was divided into three categories.</h2> 
 
<h3>The Law â€“ the writings of Moses.</h3> 
 
<h3>The Prophets â€“ the writings of men who held the office of a prophet.</h3> 
 
<h3>The Writings â€“ with the exception of Ruth and Lamentations the writingsof men who did not hold the office of a prophet. This section is also referredto as the Hagiographa in many of the Jewish texts.</h3> 
<h2>TheMasoretic Text (MT)</h2> 
 
<h3>The word masoretic means traditional . Masoretic Text refers to the traditionally accepted Hebrew Scriptures. The Masoretic Textswere originally controlled by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes.</h3> 
 
<h3>The MT is the authoritative text of the 24 books of the Jewish canon ( Tanakh or Hebrew Bible ) complete with explanatory, grammar, pronunciation and spelling notations and significant textual details. (i. , the total number of letters on a given page could be found noted in the margin of a MasoreticText. )</h3> 
 
<h3>The goal of the Masoretes was to wholly preserve the very form, words and meaning of the Scriptures. Any loss or change at all was inexcusable.</h3> 
<h2>TheHebrew Scriptures were preserved by the priests.</h2> 
 
<h3>It was a priestly duty to preserve the written revelation of theScriptures. The priests were the divinely appointed guardians and teachers ofthe Law.</h3> 

<blockquote>Deuteronomy31:24-26--And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, that Moses commanded theLevitesâ€¦ Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.</blockquote> 
<p>The law was placed in the charge of the priests to be kept by them alongside the Ark of the Covenant. The priests were also commanded to read the law every seven years.</p> 

<h3>The priests oversaw the task of making correct copies of the law for the use of kings and rulers.</h3> 

<h2>Great care was taken to protect and preserve the inspired manuscripts.</h2> 

<h3>Christ was faithful to His promise that the OT Scriptures would not perish.</h3> 
<blockquote>Matthew 5:18--For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</blockquote> 
<h3>The scribes used various techniques to insure the accuracy of the copied manuscripts of the Hebrew text. They used tests such as counting vowelpatterns and checking for the placement of certain words within the text when checking the accuracy of a newly completed copy. The entire manuscript wouldbe discarded if it was found to contain an error.</h3> 
 
<h3>From the end of the first century until the Protestant Reformation, theHebrew Old Testament was preserved by the Jews.</h3> 
<p>Jewish scribes carefully copied and preserved the manuscripts of the Old Testament. Augustine said, the Jewish scribes were the librarians of the Christian Church. The earliest of these scribes were called Tannaim (teachers). They copied the text of the OT with great accuracy. The Tannaim were followed by a group of scribes called Amoraim (Expositors). These were scholars who worked not only as copyists, but also produced TheTalmud which is a book of exposition on the laws and traditions of the Jews.</p> 
<h3>The traditional (Masoretic) text was printed at the end of the medieval period. The Psalms were printed in 1477. And in 1488 the entire Hebrew Biblewas printed for the first time.</h3> 
<h2>The burial of the Hebrew manuscripts.</h2> 
<p>The Jewish Rabbis held the copies of the HolyScriptures in great esteem. When a manuscript was too old and worn to be of any further use, they were reverently retired. It was believed to be better to give them an honorable burial than to allow the risk of them to be improperly used or profaned. This is the reason that there are only so many surviving copiesof Old Testament manuscripts.</p> 
<h2>The division of the Hebrew text into chapters and verses.</h2> 
<h3>The division of the Scripture into verses is quite an early practice and were fixed by the Masoretic family of ben Asher about AD 900.</h3> 
<h3>This system divides the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament (as we reckon them in our English Bible) into 23,100 verses. The Hebrew text is also divided into paragraphs.</h3> 
<h3>The division into chapters was first done by Cardinal Hugh of St. Cherin 1244.</h3>
