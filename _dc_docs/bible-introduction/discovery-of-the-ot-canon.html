<h2> Tests of Old Testament Canonicity</h2> 
<p>There were tests used by the Jewish leaders to judge the canonicity of a book. These principals have been determined from the writers of Biblical and Church history. There was a systematic approach to the recognition of the Canonicity of a book. This section makes mention of theBiblical writers of the canonical books. These references are only in respect to the fact that they were the human tools of the Divine Author.</p> 
<h3>Was it written by Moses?</h3> 
<p>Mosaic authorship of a book was considered a valid test of Inspiration by the Jews from time immemorial. Moses is reverenced as the great prophet of the Jews. The books that were written byMoses were considered to be of Divine origin from the earliest of the Jewish historical record. The evidence of archaeology in Palestine strongly supports this traditional view. Jesus confirmed that Moses was the human vessel who received the Law. Did not Moses give you the Law â€“ John 7:19. As was already stated the Biblical account records the immediate acceptance of the books of the law as being given by God.</p> 
<h3>Was it written by a known prophet of God?</h3> 
<p>If the book was written by a known prophet ofGod who was considered to be an oracle of God; then the book was believed to be the Word of God.</p> 
<h3>Was its writer confirmed by acts of God?</h3> 
<p>The writer was considered to be a man of God ifhe had the witness of the power of God in his life. If the writer was considered to be a man of God then his writings were also considered to be fromGod. The sons of the prophets recognized the authority of Elisha when they saw him take up the mantle of Elijah and part the Jordan River. â€“ II Kings 2:15.</p>

<h3>Is it in agreement with the rest of Canonical Scripture?</h3> 
<p>There must be perfect unity of Scripture. Doctrine in one part of Scripture must agree with the truths contained in other parts of Scripture. As has already been stated some will argue that books were only chosen that agreed with the views of the leaders who chose them. Yet, a book could not be considered as Canonical if it was not in agreement with the rest of the received Scripture. A book was recognized as being Canonical because it was inspired. This as we can see was not the only test of theCanonicity of a book. And obviously a book of Divine origin would not contradict another book of Divine origin.</p> 

<h3> Does it tell the truth about God?</h3> 
<p>The book must be accurate in its description of God and the things of God. The book would be rejected as being divinely inspired if it contained error concerning theology.</p> 
<h3>Was it accepted by the Jewish leaders as being authoritativeScripture?</h3> 
<p>Some books were accepted by the Jewish leaders as being Canonical while others were not. This is a testimony that the Jewish leaders recognized the books that were included in their Canon to be authoritativeScripture.</p>
