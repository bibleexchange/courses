	<h1><span lang="en">Determination of Canonization</span></h1>
	<p>What determined which books would be included in the Bible and which books would not be included in the Canon of Scripture? This is an important question which must be able to be answered by the serious student of the Bible. You must know beyond doubt that the Bible in its current form is THE INSPIRED WORD OF GOD.</p> 
<h2>Incorrect Views on the Determination of Canonicity</h2> 
<h3>The religious leaders determined Canonicity.</h3> 
<p>Religious councils did not determine Canonicity. The councils of man can not make a book Scripture which in its own nature is not Scripture.</p> 
<h3>Critics will assert man had to decide which books to include in the Canon therefore placing doubt on the reliability of the Bible.</h3> 
<h3>It has been argued that men chose only books that were in agreement with their religious views to be in the Canon.</h3> 
<p>This is therefore said to be the only reason for the unity and harmony of the Scriptures. The argument is that men excluded books that did not agree with their views and included only books that did agree with their views. This false view places man as the determiner of theCanon.</p> 
<h2>CorrectViews on the Determination of Canonicity</h2> 
<h3>God determined Canonicity.</h3> 

<p>God gave to man the books that He wanted to be included in the Bible. God protected and preserved the books thatHe inspired and safeguarded their collection into the Canon.</p> 
<h3>TheDivine Inspiration of a book determined Canonicity.</h3> 

<p>A book was included in the Canon because it was recognized to be the Divine Inspired Word of God. A book thatwas not deemed to be of Divine authority was not included as part of the Canon of Scripture.</p>
