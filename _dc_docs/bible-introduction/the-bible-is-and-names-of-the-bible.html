<h2><span lang="en">The Bible Is...</span></h2> 
<h3><span lang="en">The Bible is God's written Revelation of His will to men.</span></h3> 
<p><span lang="en">God wrote no other book than the Bible. There is no other physical evidence of the details of God's will and His person than the Bible. Only by reading the Bible can we be sure of so many questions regarding God.</span></p> 
<h4><span lang="en">Who is God?</span></h4> 
<h4><span lang="en">What is God like?</span></h4> 
<h4><span lang="en">What does God want?</span></h4> 
<h4><span lang="en">What is God's plan?</span></h4> 
<h4><span lang="en">Why does God do what He does?, Etc.</span></h4> 
<p><span lang="en">In the Bible, God has provided the details of His will and the expression of His love for humanity. All other supposed revelation must harmonize with this great Book. The Holy Bible is the standard for all life--temporal and eternal!</span></p> 
<h3><span lang="en">The Bible is all about Salvation through Jesus Christ.</span></h3> 
<p><span lang="en">The Bible's central theme is salvation through Jesus Christ. ("central" main, chief, basic theme - a topic, as of a lecture.)</span></p> 
<h3><span lang="en">The Bible is Translated Today from Much Older Languages</span></h3> 
<p><span lang="en">The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew (with a small percentage in Aramaic.) The New Testament was originally written in Greek. The English King James Version is a translation from these original languages. To "translate" means to change from one language to another.</span></p> 
<h3><span lang="en">The Bible is ONE</span></h3> 
<p><span lang="en">The Bible is one book, one history, and one story--HIS STORY [God's Story]! We call it the HOLY Bible because it is God's Word and not merely the story of men. The word HOLY means sacred, pure, blameless, or religious, consecrated. The Bible is a divine book yet God used people to express His Divine truths. Holy men (human element) wrote as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost (Divine element). Because it is God's Word, we cannot dispose of one book or passage of the Bible.</span></p> 
<p><span lang="en">The Bible has 66 books, 39 in the OT and 27 in the NT. The Divine revelation of the Bible moves smoothly from the beginning in Genesis to its ending in Revelation. Genesis is a book of origins; Revelation is a book of endings. The books of the Bible in-between are God's redeeming words to a wrecked, ruined world. Each book of the Bible has its own message, yet in its entirety a complete message of salvation to man can be seen.</span></p> 
<h2><span lang="en">Names of the Bible</span></h2> 
<h3><span lang="en">Holy Bible</span></h3>The actual word bible appears nowhere within the text of the Bible. The word bible comes to us from the Greek word biblios which means "books". The word biblios was originally used to refer to the papyrus reed used in the making of ancient paper. The English word bible means "books". The Holy Bible refers to the collection of Holy books.

<h4><span lang="en">Scripture</span></h4> 
<p><span lang="en">The word scripture means "writings". This word is used to refer to sacred writings, and is usually used in connection with the Bible. Jesus refers to the writings of the prophet Isaiah as the Scripture (Lk. 4:21). Jesus questions the chief priests and elders: "Did ye never read in the Scripturesâ€¦" (Mt. 21:42) Jesus again used this word when talking to the Sadducces: "Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God". (Mt. 22:29) Other references: Lk. 24:27, Rom. 1:2, Rom. 15:4, II Tim. 3:15-16; I Peter 1:20</span></p> 
<h4><span lang="en">The Word of God</span></h4> 
<p><span lang="en">This is the most significant, powerful, and complete name for the Holy Bible. The Bible is the God's written and recorded word to man. The Bible is not the word of man. The Bible is the Word of God. References: Mk. 7:13, Rom. 10:17, II Cor. 2:17.</span></p> 
<blockquote><span lang="en">Hebrews 4:12--;For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</span></blockquote>
