<h3>A. The critics say there was none by the name Darius - Darias is a title.</h3>
<p>Darius I was King of Persia from 521 to 486? B.C.</p>

<p>He was assassinated by his brother-in- law- Neriglissar. He reigned for 4 years and was killed in battle.</p>
<p> Labashi-marduk (Laborosoarchod) who was Neriglissar's son was clubbed to death after reigning for only a few months.</p>
<p> Nabonidus reigned less than a year and was taken in battle. His son was Belshazzar. Belshazzar is ruler- second ruler or in command. Jer. 27:6-7.</p>

daniel 5:
sacrilege-- nothing sacred
king usually drank alone.
wifes and concubines usually were exempt from the party in eastern cultures.
Neb brings the temple vessels to the party to drink their wine.
finger of god appears NEXT to the candleabra probably from the temple as well.v.5 highlighting their offense.
 4  They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of --- while drinking from goods vessel's!!!!
In losing the fear of God we lose for for god and appreciation for that which is sacred.
--- but fear came--- 6  Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
Lev 19:8 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
Lev 20:3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
Lev 21:12 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD. 
Lev 22:32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,--
Jer 23:11 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD. -- the profanity doesn't end with the laity.
Eze 22:8 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths. 
Is their a difference?
Eze 22:26 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
Holy holy holy Lord God almighty. Early in the morning my song shall ride to thee!!!....
