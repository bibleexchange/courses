.l r-- II. As A Parable of the Present
';1. What does this teach?
"
1. The doctrine of the totalitarian state
Vs.4
"The State is all"
(1) Its needs are paramount
(2) It's demands imperative
(3) It's commands absolute
The individual is part of the state.
2. And the state is to be worshipped
They must bring religion into it.
Man is a religious being -incorporate religion into the state -make it
subordinate.
They command worship -"to you it is commanded."
~
(1) Found true in Germany -
Taken from "the Timeglfof 29th July, 1936."
"One cannot be a good German and at the same time deny God,
but an avowal of faith in the eternal Germany is at the same time an
avowal of faith in the eternal God. If we act as true Germans we
act according to the laws of God. Whosoever serves Adolf Hitler,
the Fuhrer, serves Germany, and whosoever serves Germany,
serves God."
(2) Also true of Communism -
Communism, at the beginning, set out to smash God. They would
stamp out religion altogether. But they learned by their mistakes,
and now instead of trying to destroy, they are trying to use it. Make
it subservient to the State. Communists allow religion but keep it
under their control.
(3) The Roman Catholic Church
Simply totalitarian tyranny.
ARE WE REALL y FREE?
