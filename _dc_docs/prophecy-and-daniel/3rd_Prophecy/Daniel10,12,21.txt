War in High Places
Dan. 10:12-21
There are two epochs in Hebrew history
When angels are specially prominent.
1. The time of the judges. Destitute
of direct Revelation or prophetic
guidance.
2. The times of captivity. Under great
stress and trial.
The Angel speaks to Daniel-
Words of encouragement.
vs. 12 "Fear not Daniel"
Perhaps the signs of terror \v~re
still manifested in Daniel, and the
angel spoke encouragingly to him.
vs. 19 "Peace be unto thee"
"Be strong, yea, be strong"
"When he had spoken unto me, I was
strengthened."

I. The Combatants -
1. The Opponents
(1.) They are Spiritual
vs. 13 "The Prince of the
Kingdom of Persia."
vs. 20 "The Prince of Grecia"
Psa. 2:2 "The Kings of the earth."
There is a spiritual king behind
the earthly.
Eph.6:12 "For we wrestle (fight-
struggle-battle) not against flesh
and blood -(contending only with
physical opponents) but against
powers, against the rulers of the
darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness inhi.&h places."
(2.) They Are Numerous --
There are many ranks of evil which are
leagued against us under the leadership
of Satan. These evil spirits have a
hierarchy of their own of different orders
and different ranks.
"Principalities -Powers -Rulers of the
darkness of this world -Spiritual
wickedness. "

(3.) They Are Deceiving -
Gen. 3:1 "The serpent was more
subtil than any beast of the field."
I Tim. 4:1 "now the Spirit speaketh
expressly, that in the latter times some
shall depart from the faith, giving heed
to seducing spirits, and doctrines of
devils."
II Tim. 3:13 "But ~ ~ ~ seducers
shal!L wax worse and worse, deceiving, and
being deceived."
2. The Proponents -
(1.) The Angels
vs. 13 "Michael, me of the chief princes,
came to help me." Gabriel
Heb. 1:14 "Are they not all ministering
spirits, sent forth to minister for them
who shall be heirs of salvation."
(2.) The Lord -
vs. 18 "Then there came again and touched
me one like the appearance of a man, and he
strengthened me."
Heb. 13:5 "He hath said, I will never leave
thee, nor forsake thee."
II. The Length of The Battle -
vs. 13 "Withstood me one and twenty days."
1. From the Time Daniel started to pray.
vs. 12 "From the first day that thou didst set
thine heart to understand"
2. For twenty one days
"Withstood me" vs. 13
Remember the devil sends his workers
to intercept the messenger of God, that
is coming with the answer to your prayer.
Keep praying -the answer is on the way -
though it tarry wait for it.
III. The Cause of The Battle
Hell wants to keep people in ignorance.
Keep them bound -keep them in unbelief.
1. The Revelation of God's Secrets
vs. 14 "I am come to make thee understand."
2. The Revelation of the Future
vs. 14 "What shall befall thy people in the
latter days."
3. The Revelation of Truth
vs. 21 "I will shew thee that which is noted
in the scripture of truth."
Jesus said -Ye shall know the truth and the
truth shall make you free."
The Advesary wants to keep us from the truth.
Paul was given a thorn -because of abundance of
revelation.
IV. The Consequence of the Battle
1. Daniel was Victorious -
He prayed through vs. 12 (last part)
He received the answer.
2. The Angel was Victorious
Would he have gotten through if Daniel
?
gave up.
3. The Enemy was Defeated
"Resist the devil and he will flee
from you."
, 4. God's Kingdom Advanced
What if Daniel had failed?
