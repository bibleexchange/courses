<h2>VI.Jacob’s prophecy - Gen. 49</h2>

<h3>3. Zebulum and Issachar -Zebulum - haven of the sea vs. 13 Refers to commerce. Issachar - a strong but burdened ass vs. 14. Picture of the Jews in the present age. Merchants but enslaved by business. Israel rejected after Christ as today.</h3>

<h2>VIII.Prophecies of Judgment and Dispersion -</a></h2>
<p>Literally fulfilled. Deut. 31:1617</p>
<p>Lev. 26-Dispersion - judgment upon the nations</p>
<p>Lev. 26:33-Became a byword - Deut. 28:37</p>
<p>Note verses 54-57 - all fulfilled in 70 AD.</p>
<p>Note verse 68 Josephus says that after 70 AD many went to Egypt to work in the mines. They became slaves - so many he says &quot;No man shall buy you.&quot; World-wide dispersion - vs. 64-67 </p>
<p>Jonah in the belly of the fish but not digested -type of Israel in all nations of the world but not absorbed by them. Lev. 26:44 Jer. 22:7-9. </p>
<p>Fulfillment of these Scriptures since Israel rejected their Messiah. Luke 23:28-31 Luke 21:24</p>
<p>Fires of persecution have burned fiercely in almost every century. Middle Ages - &quot;Black Death&quot; over 25 million perished.Spain France England Germany Russia etc.</p>
<p>Jews are the miracle of history. They never pass away.Moses at burning bush - it was not consumed. Type of Israel - amid fires of persecution yet are never annihilated. The Jews are the greatest witnesses that the Bible is the supernatural revelation of God.</p>
<h2>IX.The Great Tribulation -</a></h2>
<h3>Still future-before the promised blessings the Jews will pass through horrible times.</h3>
<p>·Moses predicted the day of &quot;Their calamity&quot;. Deut. 32:35-42</p>
<p>·Foretold by Jeremiah - 30:4-7 Day of Jacob’s trouble</p>
<p>·Daniel also - 12:1 &quot;time of trouble&quot;</p>
<p>·Foretold by Jesus also - Matt. 24:21 &quot;the great tribulation&quot; is yet to come.</p>
<p>·It will affect all nations. It will be world-wide.</p>
<p>Why does God allow it? On account of their apostasy.</p>
<p>God has promised Palestine to the Jews. Palestine is the  Land of Promise They are to be brought back and restored. Whole-hearted return to the Lord - Joel 2:23 Zionism is a nationally attempted restoration of Israel. It is a restoration in unbelief. God has something better. The temple and its worship restored.</p>
<h3>The Two Classes –.Rom. 9:6 Rom. 3:2829</h3>
<p>Seed of Abraham has always been divided into 2 classes:</p></div><div10>
<h4>·Isaac –Promise </h4>
<h4>·Ishmael—Flesh</h4></div><div11>
<p>In the O.T. the Israelites who turned away from Jehovah and worshipped idols God judged. </p>
<p>A remnant always believed (faith and hope). Ezekiel 9:4Godly remnant Mal. 3. Hope of the orthodox believing Jews has never died. During the tribulation this godly remnant will accept the Christ and suffer for Him.</p>
<p>Jew’s prediction - Matt. 24:14 The abomination of desolation in Israel’s land during the Tribulation. </p>
<p>They bear witness to Christ and His soon coming to judge.&quot;All Israel shall be saved&quot; does not include the idolatrous God-blaspheming part of the nation.&quot; </p>
<p>Ezek. 20:30; 13:89; 12:9-13:1</p>
<h2>X. Israel’s Future Restoration -</a></h2>
<p>The curses and threatenings the dispersion and the sufferings mean literal Israel and have been literally fulfilled. The predictions of the future blessing and glory have not been transferred to the church but will be fulfilled in Israel. Read Deut. 30:1-9. </p>
<h3>Outstanding facts in the above passage:</h3>
<h4>1. The future dispersion is assumed. Not the Babylonian captivity of 70 years nor the captivity of the 10 tribes. The dispersion of Matt. 21:24</h4>
<h4>2. If they return unto the Lord and obey He will have compassion upon them.</h4>
<h4>3. He will return.</h4>
<h4>4. They will be re-gathered.</h4>
<h4>5. They will be restored to their land and possess it.</h4>
<h4>6. National rebirth.</h4>
<h4>7. He will deal with their enemies.</h4>
<h4>8. The Lord will abundantly bless them.</h4>
<h3>These 8 facts are the basic facts of Israel’s future.</h3>
<p>Blessing and glory.</p>
<p>Key to all is His return.</p>
<p>Hosea 5:15  ß All this refers to His Second Coming.</p>
<p>Acts 3:19-21</p>
<p>Note - &quot;the restitution of all things&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;all the prophets have spoken&quot;</p>
<p>Acts 15:14-18</p>
<p>Note the new fact - The Gentile world is to receive the Gospel witness before Israel’s hope can be realized.</p>
<p>Calling of the church - when completed He will return.</p>
<p>Isa. 10:20-24; 11:1-4</p>
<h2>XI.Results of His Coming -</a></h2>
<h3>1.Change in the animal world.</h3>
<h3>2.Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord.</h3>
<h3>3.The Son of David will stand for an ensign.</h3>
<h3>4.The Gentiles shall seek Him.</h3>
<h3>5.His rest will be glorious.</h3>
<h3>6. Israel will be re-gathered and restored.</h3>
<p>Matt. 24:2930 - &quot;the elect&quot; refers to the Jews</p>
<p>Jer. 23:56 - Luke 1:32</p>
<p>Ezekiel 37 - valley of dry bones</p>
<p>1.838194444</p>

<h1>Ch. 1 – Message and Development of Daniel</h1>
<h2>The Message of Daniel</h2>
<p>Dan. 1:1-3; 2:46-49; 5:1112; 5:29-6:3; 8:27-9:4</p>
<p>1. The Truth of It</p>
<p>Porphyry a Syrian in the third century -Not written by Daniel B.C. 533 - it was a forgery written in the time of the Maccabees about B.C. 168. After Autiochus Epiphanes. It was written before B.C. 175-165 (if not) How did it get into the Septuagint Greek Trans; completed B.C. 285 or over 100 years before it is claimed to be written. </p>
<p>Josephus says - of Alexander the Great who is foretold in Dan. 8:5-8 came to Jerusalem B.C. 332 Juddua the High Priest showed him the reference to himself.</p>
<p>Ezekiel was a contemporary of Daniel - Eze. 14:1420; 28:3. Jesus - Matt 24:15</p>
<p>Ashpenaz - Dan. 1:3 (Rabsaris) has been found upon a brick preserved in the British Museum.</p>
<p>2. The Theme of It</p>
<p>What is it all about? The Universal Sovereignty of God &quot;God is still on the throne.&quot;2:28; 4:25 Notice 1:2; 2:37; 5:18</p>
<p>3. The Time of It</p>
<p>At the beginning of Babylonian conquest.This is how the book opens. &quot;In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim King of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylonunto Jerusalem and besieged it.&quot; Dan. 1:1</p>
<p>Jeremiah 25:1 places this captivity in the fourth year of Jehoiakim Daniel in the third. Is this an error? Is the Bible wrong? The Jews counted every bit of a year as one year. Jeremiah is writing to the Jews. Daniel is writing more for the Gentiles. (9th month of the next year.) Also - The Babylonian conquest was in three stages. The servitude - the captivity - the destruction.</p>
<p>This is at the servitude stage - (3 years 9 months) Nebuchadnezzar demanded submission - Judah lost their independence -Nebuchadnezzar returned to Babylon wit choicest treasures.Daniel was taken - at about sixteen years old.</p>
<p>The history of Daniel covers about seventy five years.</p>
<h2>4. The Aim of It -What does it set out to do? (They are in captivity.)</h2>
<p>(1) To encourage the people of God to the sovereignty of God</p>
<p>to see the purpose of God and to put their faith in God.</p>
<p>(2) To give them prophetic truth -</p>
<p>Speaks much of the future end-time Second coming.</p>
<p>(3) It is a missionary account -</p>
<p>To give a missionary vision.</p>
<h2>5. The Form of It - What form does this book take?</h2>
<p>Divided into two equal parts -</p>
<p>First six chapters history -</p>
<p>Second six chapters prophecy -</p>
<p>Ch. 1-6 Daniel revealing God’s secrets to kings</p>
<p>Ch. 7-12 Angels revealing God’s secrets to Daniel</p>
<p>What is history and what is prophecy? What is the difference between them? History is the record of events - present and past. Prophecy is history written in advance.</p>
<p>How did these men write prophetically? II Peter 1:21</p>
<h2>Why is the Book of Daniel different from the other prophetic books?</h2>
<p>God is not speaking to His own people. You don’t find &quot;Thus saith the Lord.&quot; You don’t find &quot;My people&quot; Isaiah - Hosea (Lo-Ammi - not my People.) In the closing chapters God says repeatedly &quot;Thy people&quot;&quot;Jehovah&quot; hardly ever occurs in Daniel -Only in Ch. 9 - Daniel is grieving for his own people.&quot;Jehovah&quot; is the covenant name for God. Not appropriate for Gentile world powers. The most usual name for God is &quot;Adonai-Elohim&quot; The Sovereign Lord God.</p>
<h2>Part of this book is written in Hebrew Ch. 1-2:3 - 8-12. Part in Aramaic - the ancient language of Syria Ch. 2:4 - end of Ch. 7 Why do you suppose it is written in two languages? What concerns the Gentile Empires is written in their language Aramaic and what concerns the Jews is written in Hebrew.</h2>
<p>6. The name of it -</p>
<p>(1) The book is like a diary of Daniel</p>
<p>&quot;I Daniel&quot; - No definite proof who wrote it. 7:15;8:1527;10:2 7</p>
<p>·Isa. 1:1 Written by Isaiah</p>
<p>·Jer. 1:1 Written by Jeremiah</p>
<p>·Eze. 1:3 Written by Ezekiel</p>
<p>(2) Believed to be written by Daniel when in Captivity</p>
<p>606 BC carried into the land of Babylon between 16-20 years old. Daniel was a great man. Became a great statesman of Babylon. Considered as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>(3) It is all about Daniel</p>
<p>How did Daniel get promoted so quickly? &quot;Daniel purposed in his heart&quot; 1:8</p>
<p>(a) Not to defile himself</p>
<p>(b) Not to disobey God</p>
<p>(c) Not to disappoint his people</p>
<p>God exalted him because of his obedience. Daniel is referred to as the revelation of Jesus Christ in the O.T.</p>

<h1>Ch. 2 – Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream</a></h1>
<p>Daniel 2:1-30</p>
<p>(There are three divisions to this chapter: Nebuchadnezzar vs.1-13; Daniel vs. 13-23; The Understanding of the Dream vs. 24-49)</p>
<h2>I.Nebuchadnezzar – vs. 1-13</h2>
<h3>A. The King’s Distress – vs. 1 &quot;And in the second year of…Nebuchadnezzar…&quot;</h3>
<p>Two explanations why this is only the 2<sup>nd</sup>year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign:</p>
<h4>1.He wasn’t king when he took Jerusalem.</h4>
<h4>2.The schooling had not finished. Ch. 1-5</h4>
<p>Why the king was distressed:</p>
<h4>1.He was worrying about the future vs. 29</h4>
<h4>2.He was troubled over dreams vs. 1; Ch. 4:45</h4>
<h3>B. The King’s Desire – vs. 2-4</h3>
<h4>1.He called the wisemen. -- vs. 2</h4>
<h4>2.The king told them his desire -- vs. 3 &quot;To know the dream&quot; and interpretation.</h4>
<h3>C. The King’s Dilemma – vs. 5</h3>
<h4>1.He couldn’t remember the dream &quot;the thing is gone from me&quot; vs. 5a</h4>
<h4>2.The wise men could not give an answer.</h4>
<h3>D. The King’s Demand – vs. 5b-7</h3>
<h4>1.To know the Dream</h4>
<h4>2.To the Interpretation</h4>
<h3>E. The King’s Disappointment – vs. 8-11</h3>
<h4>1.The king was aware of their tricks – vs. 8 (they were frauds)</h4>
<h4>2.He was disappointed in them.</h4>
<h4>3.He was disappointed in their answer. – vs. 9 (lying and corrupt words)</h4>
<h3>F. The King’s Decree – vs. 12-13</h3>
<h4>1.It was angry. – vs. 12</h4>
<h4>2.It was complete. – vs. 12b &quot;All wise men&quot;</h4>
<h4>3.It was immediate. – vs. 13 </h4>
<h2>II. Daniel – vs. 13-23</h2>
<h3>A. Daniel’s Predicament – vs. 13 (They sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.)</h3>
<p>Will history repeat itself? Will the politicians and the wise of this world have to call the men of God?</p>
<p>Daniel’s situation is very severe. Satan could be in this. The storms of Galilee. Ungodly men are tools in the devil’s hand.</p>
<p>II Thessalonians 3:12 Paul speaks of ‘man’s extremity is God’s opportunity.’ Remember Peter in prison. – Acts 12</p>
<h3>B. Daniel’s Poise – vs. 14-15 (Not panic but poise.)</h3>
<p>Daniel was in imminent danger. Without doubt others panicked but not Daniel. &quot;Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom&quot; [ASRV: prudence &amp; discretion.]</p>
<p>Arioch was the captain or &quot;chief of the executioners (slaughtermen)&quot; &quot;Why is the decree so hasty form the king?&quot; Arioch answered and made it known.</p>
<h3>C. Daniel’s Positivity – vs. 16 (Goes boldly to the king)</h3>
<p>&quot;Then Daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time.&quot; What optimism! Nebuchadnezzar in health and sleeping well was ferocious but with nightmares  not sleeping well on edge touchy whom the wise men had already engaged. And Daniel goes in. That is positivity; that is faith.</p>
<p>Also his positivity is seen—&quot;And that he would shew the king the interpretation.&quot; Faith that anticipates the answer is really faith. The faith of Abraham Elijah etc.</p>
<h3>D. Daniel’s Policy – vs. 17-18 (What is Daniel going to do?)</h3>
<p>What would religious leaders do today? Daniel and his friends went to prayer. What were the others doing while these were praying? Daniel’s policy was prayer. </p>
<p>&quot;The effectual fervent prayer&quot; (James 5) &quot;of a righteous man availeth much.&quot; </p>
<p>Also there are four of them – &quot;Two agree&quot; Matthew 18:19</p>
<h3>E. Daniel’s Prize – vs. 19 &quot;the secret [was] revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.&quot;</h3>
<p>Deliverance resembled the form of the distress. Distress came by a dream; deliverance came by a vision. A tree was the occasion of soul disease; a tree is the means of universal healing. People bitten by a serpent are poisoned; we are cured by looking to a ‘serpent.’ Sin brought death; death brought life.</p>
<p>Lot could not help Sodom because he was mixed in with them. Daniel was separated.</p>
<p>The revelation is given twice. First by dream and second by vision. Let everything be established by two or three. Matthew 18:16</p>
<h3>F. Daniel’s Praise – vs. 19-20 &quot;Then Daniel blessed the God of Heaven.&quot;</h3>
<p>Obtainment should be followed by acknowledgment. The one Samaritan out of ten lepers (Luke 17:15). Make us like Daniel.</p>
<h2>III.The Understanding of the Dream – vs. 24-49</h2>
<p>The King and Daniel together – vs. 24-47</p>
<p>The wisdom of the world comes to naught.</p>
<p>The humility of Daniel – vs. 30</p>
<p>&quot;But as for me&quot;</p>
<p>Look at the Dream in three ways—Detail Design Destiny.</p>
<h3>A. What the dream was in detail – vs.31-35</h3>
<p>There were two main features of it –  1) An Image and 2) A Stone.</p>
<h4>1. An Image – vs. 31-33</h4>
<p>As to the image it was a man characteristic Babylonian figure. The figure is in five distinct parts: head breast and arms belly and thighs legs and finally the feet.</p>
<p>In vs. 31-33 the five parts are clearly defined with each part being a different type of substance.</p>
<h5>a.The Head                   -Gold</h5>
<h5>b. The Breast and Arms            -Silver</h5>
<h5>c.The Belly and Thighs     -Brass (maybe copper)</h5>
<h5>d. The Legs                   -Iron</h5>
<h5>e.The Feet                    -Part Iron Part Clay</h5>
<p>The costliest and the heaviest substances are on top. A decrease in price and preciousness all the way down. There is deterioration from gold to silver etc. A decrease in value and weight: Gold 19.3; Silver 10.5; Brass 8.5; Iron 7.6; Clay 1.9</p>
<p>The last brittle top heavy on an insecure foundation.</p>
<p>Look at it from another point. There is an increase in strength and in hardness of metals. Gold is soft silver and brass are not so soft and iron is very hard and breaks and crushes.</p>
<h4>2.A Stone – vs. 34-35</h4>
<p>The second thing was the stone. The image was suddenly and completely destroyed by the stone.</p>
<p>The stone is cut out without hands. This was an act of God alone. It comes from heaven. </p>
<p>It smites the image on the feet. </p>
<p>The image disintegrates. Vs. 35 (The costly gold and the strong iron.)</p>
<p>The stone then becomes a great mount and fills the whole earth.</p>
<h3>B. What the Dream was in Design – What is it all about?</h3>
<h4>1. Given by God to Nebuchadnezzar. Vs. 28</h4>
<h4>2.It is concerning what shall be in the latter days. &quot;In the end days&quot; Nebuchadnezzar was worrying about the future. Vs. 29</h4>
<h4>3.It is all about kingdoms. Vs. 39-42 It is a vision of rule and government on a world wide scale. </h4>
<h4>4.The most important kingdom is the fifth. This is the one that the stone falls on.</h4>
<h4>5.The last thing to notice is the last kingdom God’s kingdom (vs. 44) that never shall be destroyed.</h4>
<h3>C. What the dream was in Destiny</h3>
<p>Daniel says to Nebuchadnezzar &quot;And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee.&quot; vs. 39</p>
<h4>1. The procession of the empires: Babylon àMedo-Persia àGreece àRome.</h4>
<h4>2.Decrease in value—a change in government rule.</h4>
<h5>a.Gold  à Autocratic(ruler-ship by one) 5:19</h5>
<h5>b. Silver à Oligarchic (Government of the few) 6:1</h5>
<h5>c.Brass  à Aristocratic(Government by the nobility)</h5>
<h5>Militarily noble that is chief men of war and not of blood or birth.</h5>
<h5>d. Iron à Imperialistic (Militant and ruthless like Germany under Hitler.)</h5>
<p>The two legs of the image: the Roman empire was split in two in 364 AD. This created the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople and the Western Empire with its capital at Rome.</p>
<p>There has never been another world empire since the Roman empire and that is why all our civilization is based on Roman laws.</p>
<p>Yet the Anti-christ is not going to be a Roman Emperor.</p>
<h5>e.Iron and Clay  à Imperialistic &amp; Democratic (Government by the people)</h5>
<h5>f.The Stone  à Theocratic (Ruler-ship by God)</h5>

<h1>Ch. 3 – Unbending and Unburned</h1>
<p>Daniel 3:1-30</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>We will deal with this third chapter in three ways:</p>
<p>I.A History of the Past        – As history in Nebuchadnezzar’s day.</p>
<p>II.A Parable of the Present         – As a parable in our day.</p>
<p>III.A Prophecy of the Future       – As prophecy in the time of the Anti-Christ</p>
<h2>I.A History of the Past</h2>
<p>Divided into four parts:</p>
<p>Vs. 1-7 The First Decree of the King-</p>
<p>Vs. 8-18 The Defiance of  the Three -</p>
<p>Vs. 19-27 The Deliverance of the Three -</p>
<p>Vs. 28-30 The Second Decree of the King-</p>
<h3>A. The First Decree of the King vs. 1-7</h3>
<h2>&quot;Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold.&quot; Why did he do this?</h2>
<h4>1. The Image he saw - himself -</h4>
<p>Strange shape 90 - 100 ft. high 9 - 10 ft. wide. 20 to 23 years elapsed between chapter two and three.</p>
<p>The strange thing about the chapter  is there is no mention of Daniel. Daniel is away - on kings business- etc. The image may not have been made had Daniel been there. Daniel exercised a restraint upon the King as Christians should on the world and do. (II Thessalonians 2:7)</p>
<h4>2.The downfall of his kingdom had been fore told - vs. 39 of chapter 2.</h4>
<h5>a.Do you suppose he feared this and tried to strengthen his kingdom?</h5>
<h5>b.Or was he lifted up in pride because his kingdom seemed so secure?</h5>
<h5>c.Do you think he thought he was especially favored with God and so this magnified his place? Nebuchadnezzar had come to admire God and the wisdom given to Daniel but he was not brought to repentance. Is this true of today? Many who admire God and the Gospel and the Church never put trust in Christ as Savior . </h5>
<p>In this image is set forth the power and the glory of man.</p>
<p>The image bears the number of man- 60 by 6 cubits - The number of man. Six instruments of music vs. 5</p>
<p>Whenever you see man exalting himself in his pride - it is always &quot;sixes.&quot;</p>
<p>The Anti-Christ Rev. 13:18; Goliath - I Sam. 17:4-7 - II Sam. 21:20</p>
<p>The Image was made of Gold- Some believe wood overlaid with gold. Outwardly imperishable inwardly inferior.</p>
<p>In the Plain of Dura ßAll by itself .</p>
<p>The Day of dedication - Those that attended -When the band played everyone was to worship.</p>
<h4>3.The Defiance of the Decree. Vs. 8-18</h4>
<p>This is a great story. It would be three out of about 300000. Can we stand alone? Why didn’t these bow down? The second commandment - Ex 20:4-5. If they bowed down they would be deliberately disobeying the command of their God. The Christian is to obey the law of the land until they have to do something contrary to the Word of God.</p>
<p>The king gives them another chance. They might have misunderstood the command so suggests the king. Vs. 14. &quot;Is it of set purpose or is it a mistake on your part? Vs. 16. &quot;Not necessary to give you an answer.&quot; </p>
<p>Vs. 17a The Principal of Faith - Knowledge</p>
<p>Vs. 17b The Persistence of Faith - Courage</p>
<p>Vs. 18 The Pledge of Faith - Dedication</p>
<p>Job said &quot;Though He slay me yet I will trust Him.&quot;</p>
<p>The King loses his temper. The old saying is - &quot;When a man gets full of fury he gets full of folly.&quot; The furnace heated 7x’s hotter. The king lost some of his best men.</p>
<h4>4.The Deliverance over the Decree. Vs. 19-27</h4>
<p>(1) Their Faith - Revealed- they defied the decree.</p>
<p>(2) Their Faith Tried - They all fell down bound in the furnace. </p>
<p>What was it that brought deliverance? -It wasn’t the fire. - It wasn’t themselves.- It wasn’t any human being. àIt was Jesus!</p>
<p>(3) Their Faith Honored - </p>
<p>&quot;Then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth of the mist of the fire.&quot; vs. 26 &quot;Upon whose bodies the fire had no power.&quot; vs.27</p>
<h3>B. The Second Decree of the King. Vs. 28-30</h3>
<h4>1.The King’s Confession v. 28</h4>
<h5>a.Recognition of God -</h5>
<p>&quot;Blessed be the God...who hath sent His angel and delivered His servants.&quot;</p>
<h5>b. Recognition of Faith.</h5>
<p>&quot;That trusted in Him&quot;</p>
<h5>c.Recognition of real Religion</h5>
<p>&quot;Yielded their bodies&quot; Not just their heart mind or Their Spirit. Rom. 12:1</p>
<h4>2.The King’s Command - vs. 29</h4>
<h5>a.Concerns all people.</h5>
<h5>b. Concerns speech.</h5>
<h5>c.Concerns severe punishment.</h5>
<h4>3.The King’s Conduct - vs. 30</h4>
<h5>a.There is no repentance-</h5>
<h5>b. He admires God.</h5>
<h5>c.He promotes the Three.</h5>
<h2>II. A Parable of the Present</h2>
<p>What does this teach?</p>
<h3>A. The doctrine of the totalitarian state. Vs.4 &quot;The State is all&quot;</h3>
<h4>1. Its needs are paramount</h4>
<h4>2.It's demands imperative</h4>
<h4>3.It's commands absolute (The individual is part of the state.)</h4>
<h3>B. The state is to be worshiped. </h3>
<p>They must bring religion into it. Man is a religious being - incorporate religion into the state - make it subordinate.</p>
<p>They command worship -&quot;to you it is commanded.&quot;</p>
<h4>1. Found true in Germany -</h4>
<p>Taken from &quot;The Times&quot; of 29th July 1936.&quot; &quot;One cannot be a good German and at the same time deny God but an avowal of faith in the eternal Germany is at the same time an avowal of faith in the eternal God. If we act as true Germans we act according to the laws of God. Whosoever serves Adolf Hitler the Fuhrer serves Germany and whosoever serves Germany serves God.&quot;</p>
<h4>2.Also true of Communism -</h4>
<p>Communism at the beginning set out to smash God. They would stamp out religion altogether. But they learned by their mistakesand now instead of trying to destroy they are trying to use it. Makeit subservient to the State. Communists allow religion but keep it under their control.</p>
<h4>3.The Roman Catholic Church</h4>
<p>Simply totalitarian tyranny. ARE WE REALLY FREE?</p>
<h2>III.Prophecy of the Future</h2>
<h3>A. The prophecy concerns the Anti-Christ -Rev. 13</h3>
<h3>B. Mussolini started to make an image but he was hung by the heels and shot.</h3>
<h3>C. Anti-christ –Abomination</h3>
<h3>Dan. 3:28; Rom. 12.</h3>
<h4>1.His nature -Peaceful beastly</h4>
<h4>2.His image -Speak and kill</h4>
<h4>3.His mark- Mark name number</h4>

<p>II. Hysterical Revelry</p>
<p>III. Humiliating Revelation</p>
<p>I. The Historical Review -</p>
<h3>A. The critics say there was none by the name Darius - Darias is a title.</h3>
<p>Darius I was King of Persia from 521 to 486? B.C.</p>
<h3>B. They say also that Belshazzar was not the son of Nebuchadnezzar.</h3>
<p>There is no word for &quot;grandfather&quot; in Hebrew or Chaldaic.. </p>
<p>About 20 to 30 years have passed between chapters 4 and 5. Nebuchadnezzar was followed by evil Merodach. </p>
<p>He was assassinated by his brother-in- law- Neriglissar. He reigned for 4 years and was killed in battle.</p>
<p> Labashi-marduk (Laborosoarchod) who was Neriglissar's son was clubbed to death after reigning for only a few months.</p>
<p> Nabonidus reigned less than a year and was taken in battle. His son was Belshazzar. Belshazzar is ruler- second ruler or in command. Jer. 27:6-7.</p>
<h3>C. About the city - </h3>
<p>Most magnificent and luxurious. Built in a square -15 miles each way. </p>
<p>The wall surrounding the city - 87 feet thick 350 feet high. Six chariots could ride abreast.</p>

<p>Daniel was about 80 years of age</p>
<h2>II. The Content of the Dream -</h2>
<h2>The popular interpretation and what it has been interpreted to be.</h2>
<p>1. &quot;The Four Winds of the heavens strove upon the great sea. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Striving&quot; - &quot;to burst forth against&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great Sea&quot; -Mediteranean Sea (Could well be people-nations)</p>
<p>Rev. 13: 17:15 Also vs. 17- Symbolic</p>
<p>2. &quot;Four Great Beasts came up from the Sea.&quot;</p>
<p>(1.) The First like a lion -Nebuchadnezzar - Babylon</p>
<p>(2.) The Second like a Bear -Medo-Persia</p>
<p>(3.) The Third like a Leopard -Greecian</p>
<p>(4.) The Fourth - Diverse from the rest - Roman Empire</p>
<p>II. Some Objections to this Interpretation -</p>
<h3>A.  (vs. 2) The Four World-Wide Empires did not - arise in times of Storm - of tremendous commotion. The disturbances were long and they were gradual.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>B. (vs. 16-17) The Angel says that these four kingdoms shall arise but at this time Babylon was in decline and was within a short time of::dissolution. </h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>C. (vs. 4) This is Nebuchadnezzar in reverse. This is a beast which is made to stand upon its feet - like a man and is given a man's heart. Nebuchadnezzar was the reverse of this - he was a man that was given a beast's heart -and made to go on a11 fours - and eat grass like an ox.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>D. (vs. 5) &quot;It raised itself upon one side&quot; &quot;It made for itself one dominion&quot; Medo-Persia was two.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>E. (vs. 6) Alexander's kingdom arose as one kingdom; divided into four after his death.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>F. (vs. 7) Rome was not so different than all the others. The word &quot;before&quot; not in time -but in position waiting to be devoured by it. Babylon was gone - Medo-Persia was gone.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>G. (vs. 12) &quot;As concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion taken away; yet their lives were prolonged. How can you fit this into history? Nebuchadnezzar reigned until he died. The Medo-Persian Empire came to an end at the death of their king. Alexander died before his kingdom came to an end.</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>H. (Chp.8) Medo-Persia - A ram with two horns - Alexander called a he-goat one horn- four came up. (vs. 20; vs. 21-22)</h3>

<p>There are two epochs in Hebrew history. When angels are specially prominent.</p>
<p>1. The time of the judges. Destitute of direct Revelation or prophetic guidance.</p>
<p>2. The times of captivity. Under great stress and trial. The Angel speaks to Daniel - Words of encouragement. vs. 12. &quot;Fear not Daniel&quot; Perhaps the signs of terror were still manifested in Daniel and the angel spoke encouragingly to him. vs. 19. &quot;Peace be unto thee&quot; &quot;Be strong yea be strong&quot; &quot;When he had spoken unto me I was strengthened.&quot;</p>
<p>I. The Combatants - </p>
<h3>A. The Opponents. </h3>
<h4>1. They are Spiritual. vs. 13 &quot;The Prince of the Kingdom of Persia.&quot; vs. 20.</h4>
<p>&quot;The Prince of Grecia&quot; Psa. 2:2 &quot;The Kings of the earth.&quot; There is a spiritual king behind the earthly. Eph.6:12.</p>
<p>&quot;For we wrestle (fight- struggle-battle) not against flesh and blood - (contending only with physical opponents) but against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot; </p>
<h4>2.They Are Numerous - </h4>
<p>There are many ranks of evil which are leagued against us under the leadership of Satan. These evil spirits have a hierarchy of different orders and different ranks. &quot;Principalities Powers Rulers of the darkness of this world Spiritual wickedness.&quot;</p>
<h4>3.They Are Deceiving -</h4>
<p>Gen. 3:1 &quot;The serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field.&quot; I Tim. 4:1 &quot;now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.&quot; II Tim. 3:13 &quot;But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived.&quot; </p>
<h3>B.  The Proponents -</h3>
<h4>1. The Angels vs. 13 </h4>
<p>&quot;Michael one of the chief princes came to help me.&quot; Gabriel. Heb. 1:14. &quot;Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.&quot; </p>
<h4>2.Gabriel- vs. 18</h4>
<p>&quot;Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me.&quot; Psa. 91:11; Heb. 13:5 &quot;He hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.&quot; </p>
<p>II. The Length of The Battle -</p>
<p>vs. 13 &quot;Withstood me one and twenty days.&quot;</p>
<p>1. From the Time Daniel started to pray. vs. 12</p>
<p>&quot;From the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand&quot;</p>
<p>2. For twenty one days &quot;Withstood me&quot; vs. 13</p>
<p>Remember the devil sends his workers to intercept the messenger of God that is coming with the answer to your prayer. Keep praying -the answer is on the way - though it tarry wait for it.</p>
<p>III. The Cause of The Battle.</p>
<p>Hell wants to keep people in ignorance. Keep them bound -keep them in unbelief.</p>
<p>1. The Revelation of God's Secrets vs. 14</p>
<p>&quot;I am come to make thee understand.&quot;</p>
<p>2. The Revelation of the Future. vs. 14 </p>
<p>&quot;What shall befall thy people in the latter days.&quot;</p>
<p>3. The Revelation of Truth vs. 21 </p>
<p>&quot;I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth.&quot; Jesus said Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.&quot; The Adversary wants to keep us from the truth. Paul was given a thorn -because of abundance of revelation. </p>
<p>IV. The Consequence of the Battle.</p>
<p>1. Daniel was Victorious - He prayed through vs. 12  He received the answer.</p>
<p>2. The Angel was Victorious. Would he have gotten through if Daniel gave up?</p>
<p>3. The Enemy was Defeated &quot;Resist the devil and he will flee from you.&quot; </p>
