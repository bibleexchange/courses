 </</> <p> A Rule for Correct Interpretation of Scripture
 </p> <p> There is perfect &amp; unbroken unity from Genesis to
 Revelation. When interpreting a portion of Scripture, we must
 study its context. Not only the verses before and after it, but
 Scripture from Genesis to Revelation. My interpretation of that
 portion of Scripture must not disturb this perfect unity and
 harmony of Scripture. Let Scripture be its own interpreter.
 Remember: We are fully dependant on the Spirit of God to
 understand His Word (John 16:13 / I Cor. 2:6-14). Ask God to
 show you His truth (James 1:5).
 </p> <p> When establishing one doctrine from a passage, you must never
 displace any other doctrine of Scripture.
 </p> <blockquote> 
 II Peter 1:20 - Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the
 scripture is of any private interpretation.
 </blockquote> <p> Private idios, id'-ee-os =
 </p> <p> Pertaining to self, i.e. one's own; by implication, private or
 separate:--apart, aside, his own, their own.
 </p> <blockquote> 
 I John 2:27 - But the anointing which ye have received of him
 abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as
 the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and
 is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in
 him.
 </blockquote> <h6> American Tract Society Dictionary:  </h6> <p> PAUL
 </p> <p> The distinguished "apostle of the Gentiles;" also called SAUL, a
 Hebrew name. He is first called Paul in Ac 13:12; and as some
 think, assumed this Roman name according to a common custom of
 Jews in foreign lands, or in honor of Sergius Paulus, Ac 13:7,
 his friend and an early convert. Both names however may have
 belonged to him in childhood. He was born at Tarsus in Cilicia,
 and inherited from his father the privileges of a Roman citizen.
 His parents belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, and brought up
 their son as "a Hebrew of the Hebrews," Php 3: Tarsus was highly
 distinguished for learning and culture, and the opportunities
 for improvement it afforded were no doubt diligently improved by
 Paul. At a suitable age he was sent to Jerusalem to complete his
 education in the school of Gamaliel, the most distinguished and
 right-minded of the Rabbis of that age. It does not appear that
 he was in Jerusalem during the ministry of Christ; and it was
 perhaps after his return to Tarsus that he learned the art of
 tent-making, in accordance with a general practice among the
 Jews, and their maxim, "He that does not teach his son a useful
 handicraft, teaches him to steal," Ac 18:3; 20:34; 2Th 3:8.
 </p> <p> We next find him at Jerusalem, apparently about thirty years of
 age, high in the confidence of the leading men of the nation. He
 had profited by the instructions of Gamaliel, and became learned
 in the law; yielding himself to the strictest discipline of the
 sect of the Pharisees, he had become a fierce defender of
 Judaism and a bitter enemy of Christianity, Ac 8:3; 26:9-1 After
 his miraculous conversion, of which we have three accounts, Acts
 chapters 9, 22 &amp; 26, Christ was all in all to him. It was
 Christ who revealed himself to his soul at Damascus, Acts 26:15;
 I Co 15:8; to Christ he gave his whole heart, and soul, mind,
 might, and strength; and thenceforth, living or dying, he was
 "the servant of Jesus Christ." He devoted all the powers of his
 ardent and energetic mind to the defense and propagation of the
 gospel of Christ, more particularly among the Gentiles. His
 views of the pure and lofty spirit of Christianity, in its
 worship and in its practical influence, appear to have been
 peculiarly clear and strong; and the opposition which he was
 thus led to make to the rites and ceremonies of the Jewish
 worship, exposed him everywhere to the hatred and malice of his
 countrymen. On their accusation, he was at length put in
 confinement by the Roman officers and after being detained for
 two years or more at Caesarea, he was sent to Rome for trial,
 having himself appealed to the emperor. There is less certainty
 in respect to the accounts, which are given of Paul afterwards
 by the early ecclesiastical writers. Still it was a very
 generally received opinion in the earlier centuries, that the
 apostle was acquitted and discharged from his imprisonment at
 the end of two years; and that he afterwards returned to Rome,
 where he was again imprisoned and put to death by Nero.
 </p> <p> Paul appears to have possessed all the learning which was then
 current among the Jews, and also to have been acquainted with
 Greek literature; as appears from his mastery of the Greek
 language, his frequent discussions with their philosophers, and
 his quotations from their poets-Aratus, Acts 17:28; Meander, I
 Co 15:33; and Epimenides, Titus 1:1 Probably, however a learned
 Greek education cannot with propriety be ascribed to him. But
 the most striking trait in his character is his enlarged view of
 the universal design and the spiritual nature of the religion of
 Christ, and of its purifying and ennobling influence upon the
 heart and character of those who sincerely profess it. From the
 Savior himself he had caught the flame of universal love, and
 the idea of salvation for all mankind, Gal 1:1 Most of the other
 apostles and teachers appear to have clung to Judaism, to the
 rites, ceremonies, and dogmas of the religion in which they had
 been educated, and to have regarded Christianity as intended to
 be engrafted upon the ancient stock, which was yet to remain as
 the trunk to support the new branches. Paul seems to have been
 among the first to rise above this narrow view, and to regard
 Christianity in its light, as a universal religion. While others
 were for Judaizing all those who embraced the new religion by
 imposing on them the yoke of Mosaic observances, it was Paul's
 endeavor to break down the middle wall of separation between
 Jews and Gentiles, and show them that they were all "one in
 Christ." To this end all his labors tended; and, ardent in the
 pursuit of this great object, he did not hesitate to censure the
 time-serving Peter, and to expose his own life in resisting the
 prejudices of his countrymen. Indeed, his five years'
 imprisonment at Jerusalem, Caesarea, and Rome arose chiefly from
 this cause.
 </p> <p> These various journeys of St. Paul, many of them made on foot,
 should be studied through on a map; in connection with the
 inspired narrative, in Acts, and with his own pathetic
 description of his labors, II Co 11:23-29, wherein nevertheless
 the half is not told. When we review the many regions he
 traversed and evangelized, the converts he gathered, and the
 churches he founded, the toils, perils, and trials he endured,
 the miracles he wrought, and the revelations he received, the
 discourses, orations, and letters in which he so ably defends
 and unfolds Christianity, the immeasurable good which God by him
 accomplished, his heroic life, and his martyr death, he appears
 to us the most extraordinary of men.
 </p> <p> The character of Paul is most fully portrayed in his epistles,
 by which, as Chrysostom says he, "still lives in the mouths of
 men throughout the whole world. By them, not only his own
 converts, but all the faithful even unto this day, yea, and all
 the saints who are yet to be born until Christ's coming again,
 both have been and shall be blessed." In them we observe the
 transforming and elevating power of grace in one originally
 turbulent and passionate-making him a model of many and
 Christian excellence; fearless and firm, yet considerate,
 courteous, and gentle; magnanimous, patriotic, and
 self-sacrificing; rich in all noble sentiments and affections.
 </p> <p> EPISTLES OF PAU-There are fourteen epistles in the New Testament
 usually ascribed to Paul, beginning with that to the Romans, and
 ending with that to the Hebrews. Of these the first thirteen
 have never been contested; as to the latter, many good men have
 doubted whether Paul was the author, although the current of
 criticism is in favor of this opinion. These epistles, in which
 the principles of Christianity are developed for all periods,
 characters, and circumstances, are among the most important of
 the primitive documents of the Christian religion, even apart
 from their inspired character; and although they seem to have
 been written without special premeditation, and have reference
 mostly to transient circumstances and temporary relations, yet
 they everywhere bear the stamp of the great and original mind of
 the apostle, as purified, elevated, and sustained by the
 influences of the Holy Spirit.
 </p> <p> It is worthy of mention here, that an expression of Peter
 respecting "our beloved brother Paul" is often a little
 misunderstood. The words "in which" in II Peter 3:16, are
 erroneously applied to the "epistles" of Paul; and not to "these
 things" immediately preceding, that is, the subjects of which
 Peter was writing, as the Greek shows they should be. Peter
 finds no fault, either with Paul, or with the doctrines of
 revelation.
 </p> <p> The arrangement of Hug is somewhat different; and some critics
 who find evidence that Paul was released from his first
 imprisonment and lived until the spring of 68, assign the
 epistles Hebrews, 1Timothy, Titus, and 2Timothy to the last year
 of his life. See TIMOTHY.

 </p> <p> Paul's Conversion and Call
 </p> <p> Paul's Conversion Acts 9:1-6 / 26:9-18
 </p> <p> Paul encountered the Lord on his way to Damascus. In this
 encounter, the Lord identified Himself to Paul, placed His call
 on his life, (Acts 26:16-1and instructed him to go into the city
 where he would be told what to do (Acts 9:6). Having been
 blinded in his encounter with the Lord, he was led by the hand
 into the city of Damascus (v.and stayed at the house of a man
 named Judas (v.11). He was blind for three days during which
 time he fasted (v.and prayed (v.11). During this time, the Lord
 showed him a vision of a man named Ananias coming and praying
 for him that his sight might be restored (v.12). The Lord sent
 Ananias, one of the disciples of Damascus, to Paul having
 instructed him to pray for him that he might receive his sight
 and be filled with the Holy Ghost (v.17). Paul's sight was
 restored, he was baptized in the Holy Ghost (v.1and broke his
 fast (v.19).
 </p> <p> Paul's time of learning the doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus
 Christ
 </p> <p> In the middle of verse 19, there appears to be space of time not
 mentioned in Acts. The latter half of Galatians 1:16 seems to
 pick up where the first half of Acts 9:19 left off. Paul says in
 Gal. 1:16b,17;"immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
 before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto
 Damascus." After his conversion, he did not consult with the
 disciples at Damascus or the Apostles that were at Jerusalem,
 but"immediately" went into Arabia. It is believed that he dwelt
 in the northern part of the Arabian Desert, the el-Badieh
 or"Great Wilderness" of the Arabs, which lays adjacent to the
 territories of Damascus. (American Tract Society Dictionary
 under"Arabia Deserta" &amp; Easton's Bible Dictionary
 under"Arabia".) While there, he received the doctrine of the
 Gospel of Jesus Christ by revelation from the Lord (Gal. 1:11-12
 / Acts 26:16b / II Co 12:2-4). After his stay in Arabia,
 he"returned again unto Damascus" (v.17b) where he spent"certain
 days with the disciples which were at Damascus" (Acts 9:19b).
 This was his first meeting with the disciples since his
 conversion and it was here that he began his public ministry
 preaching in the synagogues of that city (Acts 9:20,22/ 26:20).
 He preached in Damascus for"many days" (Acts 9:23),"three years"
 (Gal. 1:18), but when the Jews determined to kill him and laid
 in wait for him at the city gates, the disciples let him down
 from the wall in a basket by night and he went on to Jerusalem
 (Acts 9:23-27 / 26:20 / Gal. 1:18).
 </p> <p> Galatians 1:11-17
 </p> <blockquote> 
 11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was
 preached of me is not after man.
 </blockquote> <blockquote> 
 12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it,
 but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
 </blockquote> <blockquote> 
 13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the
 Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church
 of God, and wasted it:
 </blockquote> <blockquote> 
 14 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in
 mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the
 traditions of my fathers. </blockquote> <blockquote> 
 15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's
 womb, and called me by his grace,
 </blockquote> <blockquote> 
 16 To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the
 heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
 </blockquote> <blockquote> 
 17 Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles
 before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto
 Damascus. ?
 </blockquote> <p> II Corinthians 12
 </p> <blockquote> 
 2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in
 the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot
 tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
 </blockquote> <p> And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body,
 I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
 </p> <p> 4 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable
 words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.  </p> <p> 5 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory,
 but in mine infirmities.
 </p> <p> 6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for
 I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should
 think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he
 heareth of me.
 </p> <p> 7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the
 abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in
 the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be
 exalted above measure.
 </p> <p> Paul received further understanding and knowledge of the gospel
 of Jesus Christ by revelation from God in the wilderness of
 Arabia before beginning his public ministry.
 </p> <p> When the Lord first appeared to Paul at the time of his
 conversion, the Lord said to him:
 </p> <p> Acts 26:16 - I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make
 thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou
 hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto
 thee.
 </p> <p> Here, at the time Paul was converted, the Lord said that he was
 to be a witness of the things He had just revealed to him, but
 He also speaks of appearing to him in the future and that he is
 to be a witness of the things He would reveal to him then as
 well.
 </p> <p> Paul said that (Acts 9:1-6 / 26:9-1after he was converted,
 healed and filled with the Holy Ghost; (Gal. 1:16b,
 17)"immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: Neither
 went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me;
 but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus." It is
 evident that following his conversion, healing and baptism in
 the Holy Ghost; Paul, I believe by God's direction and leading,
 avoided meeting with any of the believers around him, but
 immediately left Damascus and headed into the wilderness of
 Arabia where God revealed to him more fully the doctrines
 concerning the gospel of Jesus Christ before he"returned again
 unto Damascus," met with the disciples there and began his
 ministry(Acts 9:19-20).
