#Heaven Opened

>Revelation 19:11&mdash;And **I saw heaven opened**, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

>Joh 1:51 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see **heaven open**, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

##I. What is Heaven?

###A. A Place to Go

> John 14:2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

Heaven is a wonderful place.

###B. A Treasure House to Share

God opening up and sharing those thing which are His with us.

>1 Corinthians 2:9-10&mdash;But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 10 **But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit**: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

>ILLUSTRATION: "**Feared for His soul and was born again**. 

>The afternoon after he was saved. Finney and a friend were engaged in removing the books and furniture to another office. We were very busy in this, and had but little conversation all the afternoon. He was at peace and everything appeared to be going right.

... **as soon as I was left alone in the new office, I would try to pray again**--
... **although I no longer had any concern about my soul**, still, I would continue to pray.

Just at dark his friend went to his home. Finney accompanied him to the door; and as I closed the door and turned around, 

**my heart seemed to be liquid** within me. 

**I want to pour my whole soul out to God**.' The rising of my soul was so great that I rushed into the room back of the front office, to pray.

"There was no fire, and no light, in the room; nevertheless it appeared to me as if it were perfectly light. As I went in and shut the door after me, it seemed as if I met the Lord Jesus Christ face to face. 

I fell down at His feet and poured out my soul to Him. I wept aloud like a child, and made such confession as I could with my choked utterance. It seemed to me that I bathed His feet with my tears; and yet I had no distinct impression that I touched Him, that I recollect.

"I must have continued in this state for a good while; As soon as my mind became calm enough to break off from the interview, I returned to the front office, and found that the fire that I had made of large wood was nearly burned out. But as I turned and was about to take a seat by the fire, **I received a mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost**. Without any expectation of it, without ever having the thought in my mind that there was any such thing for me, without any recollection that I had ever heard the thing mentioned by any person in the world, the Holy Ghost descended on me in a manner that seemed to go through me, body and soul. I could feel the impression, like a wave of electricity, going through and through me. Indeed it seemed to come in waves and waves of liquid love; for I could not express it in any other way. It seemed like the very breath of God. I can recollect distinctly that it seemed to fan me, like immense wings.

"No words can express the wonderful love that was shed abroad in my heart. I wept aloud with joy and love; and I do not know but I should say, I literally bellowed out the unutterable gushings of my heart. The waves came over me, and over me, one after the other, until I recollect I cried out, 'I shall die if these waves continue to pass over me.' I said, 'Lord, I cannot bear any more;' yet I had no fear of death."

##II. What Will Open Heaven?

###A. Sin Will Open Up Heaven in Judgment (our text)

####The Great Flood
>Genesis 7:11&mdash;In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

####Sodom and Gomorrah
>Genesis 19:24 ¶ Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;

###B. Obedience

Jesus being baptized by John
>Matthew 3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to **fulfil all righteousness**. Then he suffered him. 16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

The heavens had been closed for 400 years. No open vision or revelation from God, no manifestations of God-- 400 silent years.

--FULFILL ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS--

God promised a blessing if in the new land they continued to hearken diligently unto God's voice, God would open up his good treasure!

>Deuteronomy 28:1,12&mdash; ¶ And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God 12&mdash;The LORD shall **open unto thee his good treasure**, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.

###C.Prayer

Peter went up upon the housetop to pray.
>Acts 10:9-11&mdash;On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: 10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, **he fell into a trance**, 11 And **saw heaven opened**, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:

God help us to pray until Heaven opens.

###D. Being Filled with the Holy Ghost

>Acts 7:55 But he, **being full of the Holy Ghost**, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, 56 And said, Behold, **I see the heavens opened**, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.

We need to go higher in God. As we do, we will hear and see things in the spiritual realm.

>Revelation 4:1&mdash;After this I looked, and, behold, a **door was opened in heaven**: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, **Come up hither**, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.

God help me to become complacent, but **HUNGRY** for spiritual growth.

###E. Giving

>Malachi 3:10&mdash;Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not **open you the windows of heaven**, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall **not be room enough to receive it**.
