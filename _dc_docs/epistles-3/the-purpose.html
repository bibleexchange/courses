<h2>The Purpose of Writing</h2> <h3>Address all Believers</h3> <p>&quot;To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.&quot;  1:1</p> <p>To the brethren--including the entire church of Jewish Christians.</p> <p>1:1; 1:16; 2:1,5,14; 3:1; 4:11; 5:7,9,10,19</p> <h3>Encourage Perfection in Christian Character</h3> <p>The epistle of James is a manual of instructions for holy living and a practical guide to Christian life and conduct. As a guidebook for true religion, James gives a pattern showing the characteristics of true faith.</p> <h3>Warn of Vices</h3> <p>In encouraging the perfection of Christian character, James warns of many vices: fatalism, fanaticism, formalism, favoritism, falsehood, fierce spirit, foul talk and evil speaking, and fearlessness and boasting to name a few.</p> <h4>Fatalism, which threw its sins on God</h4> <blockquote>James 1:13—Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God...</blockquote> <h4>Fanaticism, which, under the cloak of religious Zeal, was tearing Jerusalem in pieces.</h4> <p>Many men do not have real convictions of their own and they try to live up to the standards of others and find themselves frustrated.</p> <blockquote>James 1:20—For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. </blockquote> <h4>Formalism consists in washings and outward ceremonies.</h4> <p>Whereas he reminds them that true religion consists in active love and purity.</p> <blockquote>James 1:27—Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. </blockquote> <h4>Favoritism - Respect of persons.  James 2:1-18</h4> <h4>Falsehood, which had made words and oaths play-things (3:2-12)</h4> <h4>Fierce spirit, Friendship with the world. Partisanship</h4> <p>If you&apos;re under the influence of a strong false view, fierce, unkind and contemptuous spirit, &quot;ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts.&quot; Attempting or pretending to defend true religion, and to boast of your works or success in silencing an enemy; is not pure religion, nor true wisdom, and to profess either without giving God the full Glory is to lie against the truth.</p> <blockquote>James 3:14—But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. </blockquote> <h4>Foul Talk or Evil Speaking</h4> <blockquote>James 4:11—Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. </blockquote> <h4>Fearlessness and Boasting</h4> <p>James 4:16—But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</p> <h3>Instruct in Patience</h3> <p>The great lesson which he teaches them as Christians is patience, and the ground of their patience is that the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh. We need to have full Revelation of God&apos;s Word that we may understand God&apos;s Eternal Purpose. Patience...</p> <h4>in trial (1:2)</h4> <h4>n good works (1:22-25)</h4> <h4>under provocation (3:17)</h4> <h4>though treated with fraud (5:4)</h4> <h4>under oppression (5:7)</h4> <h4>under persecution (5:10)</h4> <blockquote>James 5:7-9—Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain  8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.9 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. </blockquote> <h3>The book of James is not merely informative but inspirational, as well.</h3> <p>The object of the writer is to inspire men to enforce the practical duties of the Christian life. In James 1:2-12 James gives five urgent requirements of faith and in so doing he illustrates faith&apos;s spiritual vitality. WE NEED FAITH; without it we will die.  In order for faith to remain true and alive it must be added to. Faith can only be added to as it is exercised. Faith is to always be in action, not just in motion doing something, but doing the Will of God.</p>
