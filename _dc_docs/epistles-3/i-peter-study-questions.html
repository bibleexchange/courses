	<h3>End time salvation is a complete work of God redeeming (buying back) His people from sin, not only the penalty of sin (death) and the power of sin (its dominion in our lives), but also the nature of sin (that innate propensity to do wrong). By grace through faith we may completely overcome the sin nature in ourselves and be made &quot;partakers of the divine nature&quot; (II Peter 1:4).</h3>

	<h3>13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:</h3>
	<h3>14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</h3>
	<h3>15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:</h3>
	<h3>Matthew 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</h3>
