<h2>General Details</h2>
<h3>Who it was written to:</h3> <p>To believers in general</p>
<h3>Why written:</h3> <p>To warn them against apostates within the church who, though having denied the faith, still retained their membership.</p>
<h3>Theme:</h3> <p>The duty of Christians to keep themselves spotless and to contend earnestly for the faith in the midst of apostasy</p> <p>There is a similarity between Peter&apos;s second letter and that of Jude; they both deal with apostasy in the church and describe the leaders of that apostasy. Dealing with this subject it seems that Jude quotes from Peter. (Compare II Peter 3:3 and Jude 18) They both describe the same kind of false teachers â€“ men of loose morals and shameful excesses. Also Peter describes a future apostasy whereas Jude speaks of it as present. Peter describes the false teachers as godless and extremely dangerous but not at their worst. Jude describes them as depraved and as lawless as they can be. Also it is interesting to note that Jude quotes directly from the book of Enoch, which is otherwise not part of the Bible canon. He cites Enoch's prophecy that the Lord would come with many thousands of his saints to render judgment on the whole world. He also paraphrases an incident in a text that has been lost about Satan and Michael quarrelling over the body of Moses.</p>
