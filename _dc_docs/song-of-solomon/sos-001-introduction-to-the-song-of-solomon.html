<h1>Introduction to the Song of Solomon</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Song of Solomon 1:1 The song of songs, which is Solomon's.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Language of this Book</h2>
<p>We will introduce you to the book and give some background information, but before you begin to study this book, and or listen to these messages you should read the book in it’s entirety at least three times. Pr-reading the book will greatly benefit you in following in this study of this wonderful book called the Song of Solomon.</p>
<p>Many Christians live their entire lives without reading Song of Solomon. They know it is in the Bible, but they appear to be ashamed of its presence. It is a beautiful book and nothing to be ashamed of rightly interpreted and rightly understood.</p>
<p>READ: <a href="/bible/search?q=Song%20of%20Solomon%201:1-7" target="_BLANK">Song of Solomon 1:1-7</a></p>
<p>Some Bible scholars believe that this book does not belong in the Canon of the Bible, and many do not believe that the Song of Solomon is an inspired book. All they see is a demonstration of a love affair&mdash;an earthly feeling between a lover and her friend.</p>
<p>This is not an account of earthly feelings or expressions, but a relationship that is Heavenly and Holy. This book is not a story of the natural but the the spiritual. With that in mind, prepare yourself for some expressions that are found in this book. Again, these expressions are not to be interpreted in a carnal context, but in a spiritual and holy context. In this book, Christ is manifesting His divine affection for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 1:3&mdash;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We cannot afford to take out or edit any of the Scripture just because the language becomes difficult to understand. We should embrace the whole Word of God and through prayer, study and the ministry of the Holy Ghost endeavor to understand it.</p>
<p>God has left for us the &quot;whole loaf&quot;. It is all God's word, even the Song of Solomon. God's Word is always has life in it.</p>
<h2>God Desires a Close Relationship with You</h2>
<h3>Spend Time with Him</h3>
<p>The most important thing that you can do for someone you love, is spend time with them. God loves us and wants to be with us. We truly do not grasp the whole of how much he loves us and wants a relationship with us. </p>
<p>God makes many advances toward the one He loves in this book. The Lord wants to express Himself to you! He wants to Love you like you have never been loved before! </p>
<p>On inspection in this book are also our responses to His advances. He desires that the love He has for us to be mutual. Are we too occupied with other things to spend time with Him?</p>
<p>READ: <a href="/bible/search?q=Song of Solomon 5:2-6" target="_BLANK">Song of Solomon 5:2-6</a></p>
<h3>Share with Him</h3>
<p>Somethings a loving husband and wife share with each other, are not shared with anyone else. God has some great things He wants to share with us, but we have to get close enough so He can share them with us.</p>
<p>He desires to share divine secrets in the Spirit with those He truly Loves! <a href="/bible/search?q=John 15:15" target="_BLANK">John 15:15</a></p>
<h3>Love Him Our Best</h3>
<p>He loves us, but how is our love for Him? We want to love Him with ALL, but if we are honest we often do hold reservations. What could be more important than having time for the Lord?</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ wants us as His people to Love Him with out any reservation. <a href="/bible/search?q=Matthew 22:37" target="_BLANK">Matthew 22:37</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Mark 12:30" target="_BLANK">Mark 12:30</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Luke 10:27" target="_BLANK">Luke 10:27</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Deuteronomy 6:5" target="_BLANK">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Deuteronomy 10:12" target="_BLANK">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Deuteronomy 13:3" target="_BLANK">Deuteronomy 13:3</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Deuteronomy 30:6" target="_BLANK">Deuteronomy 30:6</a></p>
<p>You don't have to be a monk or nun in order to love Him. You can be in fellowship with Him while you are busy. But if you are too busy to fellowship with Him, that is when we get in trouble. </p>
<p>ILLUSTRATION: &quot;Forget the slippers and let me have you.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lord really Loves you. We cannot fully comprehend how much God loves us. You are Spiritually desired and loved more than you can comprehend. <a href="/bible/search?q=1 John 3:16" target="_BLANK">1 John 3:16</a> <a href="/bible/search?q=1 John 4:9-10" target="_BLANK">1 John 4:9-10</a></p>
<h3>Love Him Exclusively</h3>
<p>You must know that the Lord loves you if you are going to understand this book. No one will Love you any more than Jesus Does</p>
<p>God does not want the world to play around with you, nor you to play around with the world. We often get bit by the devil only because we have been fooling around with things a child of God should never touch. God is jealous for His people. </p>
<p><a href="/bible/search?q=Exodus 20:5" target="_BLANK">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Exodus 34:14" target="_BLANK">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Exodus 4:24" target="_BLANK">Exodus 4:24</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Exodus 5:9" target="_BLANK">Exodus 5:9</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Exodus 6:15" target="_BLANK">Exodus 6:15</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Nahum 1:2" target="_BLANK">Nahum 1:2</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Song 8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Three Main Interpretations for Song of Solomon</h2>
<p>There are three general lines of thought concerning this book.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Relationship of Jehovah with Israel</li>
<li>The Relationship of Christ with His Church</li>
<li>The Relationship of Christ with His Bride</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Relationship of Jehovah with Israel</h3>
<p>Some believe that this book is entirely an allegory that sets forth God's choice and guidance of Israel. This book is a revelation God's choice for Israel as a nation, God's guidance of Israel out of Egypt, God's providence over Israel in the wilderness and God's placing of them in the Land of Canaan awaiting the Messiah.</p>
<p>There is a definite parallel with this book and the history of the Jews, but that is because Israel itself is a type. All God's dealings with Israel are typical and are given for our example and instruction. <a href="/bible/search?q=Romans 15:4" target="_BLANK">Romans 15:4</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=1 Corinthians 10:11" target="_BLANK">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Hebrews 8:5" target="_BLANK">Hebrews 8:5</a></p>
<p>God loves Israel, but God does not love ONLY Israel. God's people are not born of natural Abraham, but they are born of spiritual Abraham&mdash;i.e., by faith. <a href="/bible/search?q=Romans 9:8" target="_BLANK">Romans 9:8</a></p>
<h3>The Relationship of Christ with His Church</h3>
<p>This is probably the most popular opinion regarding this book. Most believe this book concerns a relationship with Christ and His Church. On the premise, the beginning of the Song coincides with the time just after the birth of Christ and its end relates to the end of the time of the Gentiles. The church is now in a state of waiting for the Lord to come back to meet his Church/Bride.</p>
<p>I believe there are too many discrepancies created when we try to make the entire Body of the Church to be the Bride of Christ. This leads us to the third line of thought and the main one which we will follow in our study.</p>
<h3>The Relationship of Christ with His Bride</h3>
<p>Is the Church and the Bride the same thing? Is there a difference between the Church and the Bride? What is the difference?</p>
<p>The Church is the Body of Christ and the Bride is only a part of that Body. The Bride is a fragment of the Church, like the rib that was taken out of Adam’s side).<br />
The Bride will be taken out of the great Body of the Church. <a href="/bible/search?q=Acts 15:14" target="_BLANK">Acts 15:14</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Genesis 5:24" target="_BLANK">Genesis 5:24</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Luke 12:35-38" target="_BLANK">Luke 12:35-38</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=1 Thessalonians 3:13" target="_BLANK">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Matthew 25:1-13" target="_BLANK">Matthew 25:1-13</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Revelation 19:9" target="_BLANK">Revelation 19:9</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Genesis 2:22  And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</p>
