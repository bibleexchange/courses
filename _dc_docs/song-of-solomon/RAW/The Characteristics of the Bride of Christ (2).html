The Irish thoroughbred came from a very impressive stock, including My Charmer, which was the dam Seattle Slew, the 1977 winner of the Triple Crown; Nijinsky, the 1971 winner of the British Triple Crown; and Northern Dancer, which the National Thoroughbred Racing Association cited as one of the most influential sires in thoroughbred history. Among his major wins were the Gallinule Stakes and the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial, both in 1987. It then became a stud, serving in Kentucky, Ireland, Japan and Germany. It has sired 37 winners of various stakes.</span></p><p class="cs8C58E94"><span class="csA8FE4BF0">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs9349353B">

It was bought during the Fasig Tipton Calder sale in 2006.&nbsp; Its line includes Forestry, Storm Cat, Magical Masquerade and Unbridled. Unfortunately for the new owners, Green Monkey proved to be a racing flop, racing only three times with a third place finish being its best performance. It earned just a little over $10,000. It is now available for breeding, with the owners charging a stud fee of only $5,000.</span></p><p class="cs8C58E94"><span class="csA8FE4BF0">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs9349353B">

It also made for a very good show horse because it had a beautiful dark chocolate mane.</span></p><p class="cs8C58E94"><span class="cs9442764A">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="cs9349353B">
