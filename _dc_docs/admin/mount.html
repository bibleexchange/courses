<h1><span lang="en">Lessons from the mountain</span><span lang="swa">Masomo kutoka mlimani</span></h1>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matthew gives first the Beatitudes, the joyous shouts of exclamation over the attitudes and the activities of disciples in the kingdom: the "poor in spirit" recognize their helplessness and have no one to trust but God; "they that mourn" are keenly conscious of their sin and deeply sensitive to the needs of others; "the meek" are the teachable, those who are always willing to learn new truth and new ways; those who "hunger and thirst after righteousness" have an insatiable longing for a deeper relationship with God.--Teachers Bible Commentary</span><span lang="swa"> </span></blockquote>

<p><span lang="en">We need to separate ourselves from the distractions of this world long enough to be able to hear the lessons that God wants to teach to us.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>
<h3><span lang="en">When we are on the mountain we are away from the distractions of the world</span><span lang="swa">Wakati tukiwa mlimani tuko mbali na shughuli za Dunia</span></h3>
<p><span lang="en">Life is filled with distractions. There are many things in life that fight for our attention: work, responsibilities, ministry, family, friends, entertainment, news, politics, books radio, internet, and television. These things are not inherently evil, but they can be harmful to us if they distract us from hearing from God.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>

Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>

<p><span lang="en"><strong>Mark 6:46</strong> And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>
<h4><span lang="en">How do we "go up to the mountain?"</span><span lang="swa">Tunaendaje  " juu mlimani?"</span></h4>
<p><span lang="en">This does not mean that you need to climb Mt. Meru or Kilimanjaro to find a place close to God, but you do need to find a place where you can focus all your attention on Him.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>
<p><span lang="en"><strong>Matthew 6:6</strong> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>

<p><span lang="en">Sometimes we get so busy that we are like Martha and do not remember the reason we are working.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>
<p><span lang="en">We need to work, but we cannot forget why we work (to glorify God) and we cannot let work crowd out our prayer time.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>
<p><span lang="en">I will conclude this point with the illustration about the woman with the oil in 2 Kings 4:1-7. She was told go into her house and shut her door before the miracle happened.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>

Familiarity has made them palatable today; their stark challenge to our deepest notions about life is easily passed over. But that first time the challenge must have been almost overwhelming.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>

<blockquote><span lang="en">The biblical answer to the paralysis of low self-esteem is not high self-esteem; it is sovereign grace. You can test whether you agree with this by whether you can gladly repeat the words of Isaiah 41:13, "Fear not, you worm JacobÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel." In other words, God's way of freeing and mobilizing people who see themselves as worms is not to tell them that they are beautiful butterflies but rather to say, "I will help you. I am your redeemerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Go to Egypt now, and I will be with you."--John Piper</span><span lang="swa"> </span></blockquote>

For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>
<p><span lang="en">"When we are weak then we are strong. People often think they have not strength enough; the fact is we have too much strength.

<p><span lang="en">John 15:18-20 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</span><span lang="swa"> </span></p>
