<h1>Lessons from the mountain</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew gives first the Beatitudes, the joyous shouts of exclamation over the attitudes and the activities of disciples in the kingdom: the “poor in spirit” recognize their helplessness and have no one to trust but God; “they that mourn” are keenly conscious of their sin and deeply sensitive to the needs of others; “the meek” are the teachable, those who are always willing to learn new truth and new ways; those who “hunger and thirst after righteousness” have an insatiable longing for a deeper relationship with God.—Teachers Bible Commentary</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Lesson 1: Go up to the mountain</h2>
<p><strong>Matthew 5:1-2</strong> And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</p>
<p>We need to separate ourselves from the distractions of this world long enough to be able to hear the lessons that God wants to teach to us.</p>
<h3>When we are on the mountain we are away from the distractions of the world</h3>
<p>Life is filled with distractions. There are many things in life that fight for our attention: work, responsibilities, ministry, family, friends, entertainment, news, politics, books radio, internet, and television. These things are not inherently evil, but they can be harmful to us if they distract us from hearing from God.</p>
<h4>Examples of people that went up to the mountain</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Moses went up to the mountain to receive the Law of God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Paul was saved he went into the desert to be taught by God.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Galatians 1:15-18</strong> But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are many stories of great men who received help from God when they went into a closet to pray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even Jesus separated Himself to go and pray. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mark 6:46</strong> And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</p>
<h4>How do we &quot;go up to the mountain?&quot;</h4>
<p>This does not mean that you need to climb Mt. Meru or Kilimanjaro to find a place close to God, but you do need to find a place where you can focus all your attention on Him.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 6:6</strong> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</p>
<p>We need self-discipline—this is how we can hear God's voice even in the midst of our hectic surroundings. </p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule a time for prayer and study</li>
<li>Turn off the phone</li>
<li>Separate yourself from family</li>
<li>Take a break from work</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes we get so busy that we are like Martha and do not remember the reason we are working.</p>
<p>We need to work, but we cannot forget why we work (to glorify God) and we cannot let work crowd out our prayer time.</p>
<p>I will conclude this point with the illustration about the woman with the oil in 2 Kings 4:1-7. She was told go into her house and shut her door before the miracle happened.</p>
<h3>When we are on the mountain we are closer to God</h3>
<p><strong>Psalms 73:28</strong> But it is good for me to draw near to God…</p>
<h4>There are lessons we need to learn from God</h4>
<p>We do not know everything.</p>
<p>The things that Jesus said were new to the hearers. We have to be willing to accept that the way we think about things may be wrong and be also ready to hear the right things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New values (Matt. 5:1–12). When first heard by disciples, the familiar words of the Beatitudes must have sounded jolting and strange. Familiarity has made them palatable today; their stark challenge to our deepest notions about life is easily passed over. But that first time the challenge must have been almost overwhelming.</p>
<p>What Jesus did in these few verses was to set up a new system of values by which His people are to live. Implicit is a rejection of the values which lie at the core of human civilizations and which shape most individual personalities.—Teachers Commentary</p>
</blockquote>
<p>|Jesus' Values|Counter Values|
|-----|-----|
|BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO …|BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO ARE …|
|(v. 3) are poor in spirit|self-confident, competent, self-reliant|
|(v. 4) mourn|pleasure-seeking, hedonistic, “the beautiful people”|
|(v. 5) are meek|proud, powerful, important|
|(v. 6) hunger for righteousness|satisfied, “well adjusted”, practical|
|(v. 7) are merciful|self-righteous, “able to take care of themselves&quot;|
|(v. 8) are pure in heart|“adult,” sophisticated, broad-minded|
|(v. 9) are peacemakers|competitive, aggressive|
|(v. 10) are persecuted becuase of righteousness|adaptable, popular, “don’t rock the boat&quot;|</p>
<p>(Chart from Teachers Commentary) </p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 1:5</strong>  A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>
<p><strong>2 Peter 3:18</strong> But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ…</p>
<p>Paul said, &quot;that I may know Him!&quot; (Philippians 3:10)</p>
<h4>We need a time of preparation before we can minister to others.</h4>
<p>We need these lessons before we can help people.</p>
<p>Jesus spent time alone in the wilderness before He started His public ministry.</p>
<p>Moses had to spend time  on the mountain before he could lead the people.</p>
<h2>Lesson 2: Blessed</h2>
<h3>A definition of <em>blessed</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Strong’s: supremely blest; fortunate or well off because of [addition]: blessed, happy(happier).</li>
<li>Bro. Reynolds: Happy, spiritually prosperous, one to be envied</li>
<li>Simply put: One that is blessed is one that received blessings.</li>
<li>YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS LIKE</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Every one of these Beatitudes is prefaced with the word “Blessed,” which is really a shout of joy: “Oh, the happiness!”—Teachers Bible Commentary</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>These blessings are spiritual ones.</h3>
<p>So often we focus on prosperity and physical blessings, but all the blessings in this list are spiritual ones. Can you put comfort or mercy in your pocket? No. We should not be so greedy of gain that we forget the true treasures.</p>
<p><strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:</p>
<h3>Spiritual blessings are better than physical blessings.</h3>
<p><strong>Matthew 6:19-20</strong> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 8:11</strong> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>
<h3>Examples of people that were blessed.</h3>
<h4>Abraham</h4>
<p><strong>Genesis 24:1</strong>  And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age:and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.</p>
<p>If any man was blessed, it was Abraham. God called him out of paganism, gave him a new inheritance in another land, gave him a son when he was 90 years old, and called him &quot;friend.&quot;</p>
<h4>The Israelites</h4>
<p><strong>Numbers 22:12</strong> And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.</p>
<p>The Israelites were delivered out of Egypt and on their way to receive their inheritance. </p>
<h4>Samson</h4>
<p><strong>Judges 13:24</strong> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson:and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.</p>
<p>Samson was given supernatural strength. </p>
<h4>Mary</h4>
<p><strong>Luke 1:28</strong> And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</p>
<p>Mary was chosen to give birth to the Messiah.</p>
<h2>Lesson 3: The blessing of the poor in spirit</h2>
<h3>The description of the poor in spirit</h3>
<p>What does it mean to be poor in spirit?</p>
<h4>The poor in spirit are those that realize they are nothing</h4>
<p><strong>Matthew 5:3</strong> Great blessings belong to those who know they are spiritually in need. God's kingdom belongs to them. (Easy to Read Version)</p>
<p>Poor—beggars-those that have nothing of their own</p>
<p>John Wesley described them as: They who are unfeignedly penitent, they who are truly convinced of sin; who see and feel the state they are in by nature, being deeply sensible of their sinfulness, guiltiness, helplessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “poor” are those who have God as their only resource.—The Apologetics Study Bible</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Romans 12:3</strong> For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If life were stable, I’d never need God’s help. Since it’s not, I reach out for Him regularly. I am thankful for the unknowns and that I don’t have control, because it makes me run to God.—Francis Chan</p>
<p>Throughout time, somewhere between forty-five billion and one hundred twenty-five billion people have lived on this earth. That’s 125,000,000,000. In about fifty years (give or take a couple of decades), no one will remember you. Everyone you know will be dead.—Francis Chan</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalms 73:26</strong> My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 57:15</strong> For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</p>
<p>This same saying is recorded in Luke along with a rebuke to the rich.</p>
<p><strong>Luke 6:20</strong> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said,
Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>Luke 6:24</strong> But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.</p>
<p>Let us compare these two Scriptures with the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-25. Lazarus was a poor beggar, but his heart was right so he received eternal life. The other man was rich and it seemed he trusted in those riches more than he trusted in God. Because of this, he received eternal damnation. </p>
<p><strong>Luke 16:25</strong> But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>
<p>It is a dangerous thing to be confident in yourself and think that you are rich. The fact is that without Christ, we are all spiritually poor.</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 3:17</strong> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:</p>
<h4>The poor in spirit are those that realize God is everything</h4>
<p><strong>Psalms 71:19</strong> Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high,
who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!</p>
<p><strong>Psalms 86:10</strong> For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.</p>
<h4>The poor in spirit are those that realize that “With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.”</h4>
<p>Philippians 4:13</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The biblical answer to the paralysis of low self-esteem is not high self-esteem; it is sovereign grace. You can test whether you agree with this by whether you can gladly repeat the words of Isaiah 41:13, &quot;Fear not, you worm Jacob… I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.&quot; In other words, God's way of freeing and mobilizing people who see themselves as worms is not to tell them that they are beautiful butterflies but rather to say, &quot;I will help you. I am your redeemer…Go to Egypt now, and I will be with you.&quot;—John Piper</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Psalms 84:5</strong> Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.</p>
<p>David had the victory over Goliath not because he was strong or because he thought he was great. No, David's victory was because he knew that &quot;the battle is the Lord's.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 30:26</strong> The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</p>
<p><strong>2 Corinthians 12:7-10</strong> And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</p>
<p>&quot;When we are weak then we are strong. People often think they have not strength enough; the fact is we have too much strength. It is when we feel that we have no strength of our own, that we are willing that God should use us, and work through us. If we are leaning on God's strength, we have more than all the strength of the world.&quot; --D. L. Moody</p>
<h3>The blessing of the poor in spirit—the Kingdom of Heaven</h3>
<p><strong>Romans 14:17</strong> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Not physical blessings “not meat and drink”</p>
<p>Spiritual blessings—The things of God</p>
<h4>The Kingdom of Heaven is righteousness</h4>
<p>We realize that we are poor and that we have no righteousness of our own. This puts us in the position to receive the righteousness of God.</p>
<p><strong>Philippians 3:9</strong> And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</p>
<p>If we think we are able to make our own righteousness, then we will fall even as Lucifer did. But if we know that only God is able, then He will raise us up in righteousness.</p>
<p>It was pride that changed angels into devils; it is humility that makes men as angels. -St. Augustine</p>
<h4>The Kingdom of Heaven is peace</h4>
<p>We are not trusting in our ability, but in God's ability. This means we do not have to worry about problems because we know that He will take care of them.</p>
<p>Peace is the absence of mental stress or anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Psalms 4:8</strong> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep:
for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.</p>
<p><strong>Psalms 29:11</strong> The Lord will give strength unto his people;
the Lord will bless his people with peace.</p>
<p><strong>John 14:27</strong> Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you:not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</p>
<h4>The Kingdom of Heaven is joy</h4>
<p><strong>Psalms 21:1</strong> The king shall joy in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!</p>
<p><strong>Psalms 32:11</strong> Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous:
and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.</p>
<p>1 Peter 1:8 calls it joy unspeakable and full of glory.</p>
<p>John 16:22 says that no man can take the joy of  the Lord away from us. </p>
<h2>Lesson 4: The blessing of the mourners</h2>
<p>Isaiah 61:3
To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,
the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness;
that they might be called trees of righteousness,
the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes 7:2-4
It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting:for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. Sorrow is better than laughter:for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</p>
<p><strong>Luke 6:25</strong> Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</p>
<h3>David—Crying because of his sin</h3>
<p>The story of David and Bathsheba</p>
<p>David carried his sin for a least nine months (we know this because Bethsheba's baby was born). Why did he wait so long?</p>
<p>Because they have sinned</p>
<p>If you do something wrong, then you need to make it right.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 7:10
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of:but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>
<p>James 4:8-10
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep:let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</p>
<h4>They feel the need</h4>
<ul>
<li>Guilt if it was their sin</li>
<li>Sorrow</li>
</ul>
<h4>They seek for a cure</h4>
<ul>
<li>Repentance</li>
<li>Prayer</li>
</ul>
<p>How are they comforted?</p>
<p>They will be granted forgiveness in response to their repentance.</p>
<p>Some people want the comfort, but don't want the repentance. </p>
<h3>Job—Crying because of difficulties in the world</h3>
<p>Job 16:20
20 My friends scorn me:
but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</p>
<p>Why are they mourning?</p>
<h4>Because there is tribulation in the world</h4>
<h4>Because of their human frailty</h4>
<p>Job got help when he prayed for his friends. He first cared for his friends, and then God comforted him.</p>
<h3>Jeremiah—Crying because other people are in need</h3>
<p>2 Corinthians 2:4
4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 9:1
Chapter 9
 Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears,
that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!</p>
<p>Luke 19:41-42
And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p>
<h4>Because there are people that are lost</h4>
<p><strong>Psalms 126:5-6</strong> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed,
shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.</p>
<h4>Because there are people with needs</h4>
<p>There needs to be a seriousness in our lives. </p>
<p>There are many people that are lost, people that are hurting, and people that have great needs. We need to have compassion on them. We need to be considerate.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 12:15</strong> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</p>
<p><strong>Galatians 6:2</strong> Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Hebrews 12:12</strong> 
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees</p>
<p>It's not all about me!</p>
<p>We need to not be selfish and instead be concerned with the needs of others. </p>
<h2>Lesson 5: The blessing of the meek</h2>
<h3>The meek exhibit restraint over their actions.</h3>
<p>Meekness is having power, but not abusing it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meekness is when Jesus did nothing when the servant of the high priest smoke Him.</li>
<li>Meekness is when Jesus said nothing as He stood before Pilate.</li>
<li>Meekness is when Jesus did nothing as the Roman soldiers mocked Him as King of the Jews.</li>
<li>Meekness is when Jesus did not protect Himself as they pulled at His beard and spat on Him.</li>
<li>Meekness is when Jesus did not call a legion of angels to rescue Him as He hung on the cross. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proverbs 25:28</strong> He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 16:32</strong> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p>
<p>Better than Hannibal, Alexander, or Napoleon is the man that can rule his spirit. Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini--These great men could conquer nations, but they could not control their own spirit.</p>
<h3>Meek are submissive to the will of God.</h3>
<h3>The meek endure offenses with patience.</h3>
<h3>The meek are teachable.</h3>
<h3>The meek shall inherit the earth.</h3>
<h2>Lesson 6: The blessing of the hungry</h2>
<h3>There should be a desire for God.</h3>
<p>When you are hungry, your stomach growls. It's asking you for food.</p>
<p>If you are not earnest in seeking God, then you will not find anything</p>
<p>We have to seek for it like treasure.</p>
<p>Psalms 42:1-2
 As the hart panteth after the water brooks,
so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God:
when shall I come and appear before God?</p>
<p>Psalms 84:2
2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord:
my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.</p>
<h3>We should seek Him all day long.</h3>
<p>You get hungry for food more than one time each day.</p>
<p>Psalms 63:1
 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee:
my soul thirsteth for thee,
my flesh longeth for thee
in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</p>
<p>Psalms 63:6
6 When I remember thee upon my bed,
and meditate on thee in the night watches.</p>
<p>Proverbs 8:17
 I love them that love me;
and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p>Psalms 25:5
5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me:
for thou art the God of my salvation;
on thee do I wait all the day.</p>
<p>Psalms 55:17
17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
and he shall hear my voice.</p>
<h3>God will reward those that seek</h3>
<p>Matthew 7:7-8
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p>
<p>James 4:2
Ye lust, and have not:ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</p>
<h2>Lesson 7: The blessing of the merciful</h2>
<h3>What does it mean to be merciful?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Forgive people</li>
<li>Have compassion on people</li>
<li>Help people who don't deserve it</li>
<li>help people even though they can't repay you</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Romans 12:8</strong> Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. </p>
<h3>Why should we be merciful?</h3>
<p><strong>Psalms 41:1</strong> Blessed is he that considereth the poor:
the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>2 Samuel 22:26</strong> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful,
and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 11:17</strong> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul:
but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.</p>
<p><strong>Mark 11:25</strong>
And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any:that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 6:14-15</strong> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>
<p>The parable of the unforgiving servant. Matthew 18:21-35</p>
<p><strong>James 2:13</strong>
For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we do not extend mercy, we are demonstrating that we have not received mercy. —David Platt</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Luke 6:36</strong> Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</p>
<p>Matthew 25:40
And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 12:20-21</strong>
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. 21  Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. </p>
<p>Romans 15:1-3
Chapter 15
 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification. For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.</p>
<h2>Lesson 8: The blessing of the pure in heart</h2>
<h3>Why so much concern for the heart?</h3>
<p>God is concerned with the heart. It is the source of all our actions.</p>
<h4>Our actions are a meter of what is in the heart.</h4>
<p>Matthew 12:33-35
Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt:for the tree is known by his fruit. O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things:and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.</p>
<p>Matthew 15:18-19
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</p>
<h4>Looks can be deceiving</h4>
<p>1 Samuel 16:7
But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him:for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.</p>
<p>Matthew 23:25-28
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</p>
<p>Proverbs 4:23
23 Keep thy heart with all diligence;
for out of it are the issues of life.</p>
<h4>God is never deceived about men's hearts</h4>
<p>Psalms 44:21
21 Shall not God search this out?
for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</p>
<h3>How is it purified?</h3>
<p>We cannot make our hearts pure on our own. We need God's help. He gives us righteousness. But we still need to want it and believe for it.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 10:3</strong> For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. </p>
<h3>The sight of God</h3>
<p>To be in His presence.</p>
<p>To commune with Him.</p>
<p>To have a revelation of who He is</p>
<h3>Keeping the line of sight clear</h3>
<p>If we have things between us ands God, we will not be able to see Him.</p>
<p>Psalm 26:1 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.</p>
<h4>Constantly Cry for God to Search Your Heart “Judge me, O LORD”</h4>
<ul>
<li>Examine me v. 2</li>
<li>prove me v.2</li>
<li>try my reins and my heart v. 2</li>
</ul>
<h4>Maintain Moral Purity “I have walked in mine integrity”</h4>
<ul>
<li>thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes v. 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Philippians 4:8
8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have walked in thy truth v. 3</li>
<li>I have not sat with vain persons v. 4</li>
<li>neither will I go in with dissemblers v. 4</li>
<li>I have hated the congregation of evil doers v. 5</li>
<li>and will not sit with the wicked v. 5</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Psalms 1:1</strong> Blessed is the man
that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
nor standeth in the way of sinners,
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>
<p><strong>Psalms 1:3</strong> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
that bringeth forth his fruit in his season;
his leaf also shall not wither;
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 13:14</strong> But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. </p>
<ul>
<li>I will wash mine hands in innocency v. 6</li>
<li>so will I compass thine altar, O LORD v. 6</li>
<li>LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house v. 8</li>
</ul>
<p>Isaiah 26:3
3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on thee:
because he trusteth in thee.</p>
<h4>Tenaciously Trust in God “I have trusted also in the LORD”</h4>
<pre><code>Tenacious—holding fast; characterized by keeping a hold
</code></pre>

<p>Synonyms—determined, inflexible, persevering, persistent, relentless, resolute, steadfast, unshakable, unwavering</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men v. 9</li>
<li>redeem me v. 11</li>
<li>be merciful unto me v. 11</li>
</ul>
<p>Psalm 27:13 I had fainted, unless I had believed…</p>
<p>Conclusion: We can avoid backsliding “therefore I shall not slide”
My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD v. 12</p>
<h2>Lesson 9: The blessing of the peacemaker</h2>
<h3>What is a Peacemaker?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Definition: person who settles problem </li>
<li>Synonyms: appeaser, arbitrator, conciliator, diplomat, mediator, negotiator, pacifier, pacifist, peacekeeper, placate</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Christians should bring peace, between people and God and between those who are at odds with each other. We share the Gospel of peace.—Warren Wiersbe </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How does a Peacemaker make peace?</h3>
<h4>Passively</h4>
<p>Many times we can keep peace by simply not doing something.</p>
<h5>Don't get angry</h5>
<p><strong>Proverbs 15:18</strong> A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 29:22</strong> An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.</p>
<p><strong>James 1:19</strong> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
<h5>Don't talk so much</h5>
<p><strong>Proverbs 10:19</strong> In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.</p>
<h5>Don't gossip</h5>
<p><strong>Proverbs 26:20</strong> Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 16:28</strong> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.</p>
<p>A little gossip may destroy even the closest friendships.</p>
<h5>Don't get involved where it is not your business</h5>
<p><strong>Proverbs 20:3</strong> It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.</p>
<h5>Don't involve yourself in difficult situations</h5>
<p><strong>Proverbs 22:3</strong> A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.</p>
<p><strong>2 Timothy 2:23</strong> But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>
<h5>Don't be so negative</h5>
<p><strong>Proverbs 22:10</strong> Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.</p>
<h5>Don't be so proud</h5>
<p><strong>Proverbs 28:25</strong> He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat.</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 13:10</strong> Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.</p>
<p>A a peacemaker  does not try to push his way.</p>
<p>He does not refuse to do things someone else’s way.</p>
<h4>Actively</h4>
<ul>
<li>He foresees problems and works to prevent them.</li>
<li>He tries to bring those involved in the problem to a mutual understanding (compromise).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what diplomats do for their countries. They meet with other diplomats and try to find ways that the countries can work together.</p>
<ul>
<li>He offers his advice in a proper manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be a better way to do things. You can help the fighting people to see the errors that they are making. Make sure that you use wisdom and go in the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
<ul>
<li>He helps both parties see there is nothing to fight about.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mark 9:38-40</strong> And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us:and we forbad him, because he followeth not us. But Jesus said, Forbid him not:for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. For he that is not against us is on our part.</p>
<p>Some times we need to remind others we are on the same team. Just like when a player will say, &quot;same team!&quot; when two basketball players of the same team are accidentally fighting for the ball.</p>
<p>The story of Abigail making peace between her husband (Nabal) and David in 1 Samuel 25 is a wonderful example of being a peacemaker.</p>
<p>Esther is another example of a peacemaker.</p>
<h3>What are the rewards of a Peacemaker?</h3>
<h4>He is blessed</h4>
<p>Happy, spiritually prosperous, one to be envied</p>
<h4>He is a child of God</h4>
<p>In the Greek, this word does not mean babies or little children, but it is full, mature sons. Sons that are ready to receive the inheritance of the father.</p>
<p>If you are a peacemaker, then God will give you an inheritance of spiritual things.</p>
<p>You will be in a special position of favor in God's eyes.</p>
<p>“These not only are the children of the peace-loving God, but they come to be called so; for men are struck by their likeness to their Father.” —Charles Spurgeon</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Romans 14:19</strong> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</p>
<h2>Lesson 10: The blessing of the persecuted</h2>
<h3>Suffer for Christ's sake</h3>
<p>1 Peter 2:20-21
For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called:because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</p>
<h3>God will reward you for suffering</h3>
<p><strong>Romans 8:17-18</strong>
And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18  For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. </p>
<h3>You're not alone in suffering</h3>
<p>Luke 6:26
Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</p>
<p>John 15:18-20
If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</p>
