			<h1>Angels are servants, Christ is Son</h1>
			<h2>A better name - 1:4. Acts 4:10 "by the name of Jesus Christ" "whole"</h2>
			<h3>Through His Name men are healed, Acts 4:10</h3>
			<h3>Through His Name men are saved, Acts 4:12 </h3>
			<h3>Through His Name men are made perfect, Heb. 13:21 </h3>
			<h3>"Every knee should bow", Phil. 2:10 </h3>
			<h2>"Angels" messengers – servants. Look at the better name without putting down one Angel. Angels are God's creation.</h2>
			<h3>"Jesus" Savior of the world</h3>
			<h3>"Christ" Anointed one</h3>
			<h3>&nbsp;"Lord" Controller, Great Master, Rule and Ruler</h3>
			<h3>"Son"</h3>
			<h4>Beloved &amp; only Begotten of the Father John 3:35; 3:16; Heb. 1:6 </h4>
			<h4>Heir of all things Heb. 1:2</h4>
			<h4>"Angels of God" Heb. 1:6</h4>
			<h1>Christ is the Word. </h1>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Christ is the voice and the message. John 1:1,14,23; Gen. 3:8; Heb. 1:7,14. Angels carry the Word like men.Jesus became like men that men might become like the Word.</p>
			<h1>Christ alone is to be worshipped.</h1>
			<blockquote>Heb. 1:6 --Let all the angels of God worship Him.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>John 4:24 --...In spirit and in truth.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Matt. 4:10 --Worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve. </blockquote>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Angels are not to be worshipped. (Ex. 20:3; Rev. 14:7; I John 5:21)</p>
			<blockquote>Isa. 42:8,12 --...I am the Lord; THAT IS MY NAME… ("My Glory" "My Praise")</blockquote>
			<h1>Christ's reign is forever and ever.</h1>
			<blockquote>Hebrews 1:8--But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Psalm 45:6--Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
			</blockquote>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Angels are spirit beings that were made by God as messengers that carry the urgent fiery messages of God to people.The Son of God is a Spirit but not a created being like the angels; He is GodHimself who rules and reigns over the universe. Angels are created beings, made to serve God just as fire and wind have been made to serve God.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Angels and Christ are contrasted by the fact that Christ is the source whereas angels and messengers bare witness of Christ. Christ's kingdom is forever and exalted above any earthly or spiritual kingdom.</p>
