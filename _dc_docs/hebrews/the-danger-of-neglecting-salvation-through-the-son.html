			<h1>The Danger of Neglecting Salvation through the Son (2:1-4)</h1>
			<h2>A Great Danger</h2>
			
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Great Danger is that men will not heed the Gospel. Pay Close Attention for there will be no EXCUSES: "It slipped my mind" "Time slipped by so rapidly" "My steps had well nigh slipped" (Ps. 73:2). There is an intense attention demanded! "GIVE!!!" </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">If we are not careful we are in danger of: Drifting away 2:1; Punishment 2:2; Judgment 2:2; No substitute 2:2; No captain 2:10; Fear 2:15; Bondage 2:15; No reconciliation 2:17; No help 2:18; Temptation 2:18</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">God's last word is Christ. He is the fulfilment of the prophetic hopes of Israel. Christ holds a unique relationship to the Father and the Holy Ghost; and stands in contrast to angels who are created beings. On this doctrinal basis, a warning is given: Men must listen to the Son. If it was necessary in O.T times. to heed the word of angels (Gal. 3:19), how much more necessary is it to heed the Word of the Lord? There is no hope of salvation outside of Jesus Christ.</p>
			<h2>The Force of a Word Given by Angels</h2>
			<blockquote>Heb. 2:2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and  every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</blockquote>

				<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Judgment accompanied the word of angels.</p>
				<h3>Nadab and Abihu</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Nadab and Abihu offered strange fire and died. (Lev. 10:1-7)</p>
				<h3>Achan</h3>
				<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Achan took of the spoil of Jericho and Israel was defeated  on the battlefield until Achan and his family were stoned and burned. (Joshua 7)  A curse was on Jericho. If just one took of the accursed thing  it would make the whole camp of Israel a curse and trouble it. (Joshua 6:18) Achan took, all Israel paid for it. Israel went to the  battle field without knowing what Achan had done and suffered defeat. 36 men  died. (Joshua 7:1) </p>
				<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Provision was made for Israel who was in ignorance, but  the Israelites that sinned with a high hand died without mercy, stoned and  burned.  A strict concept  of justice was maintained throughout O.T. history.</p> 
			
			<h2>The Force of a Word Given by the Lord</h2>
			<h3>God's Judgment is Inevitable</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">If judgment fell on those who transgressed the Law given by the mediator of angels, how much more punishment on the one who rejects the Word of God's Son? (Heb. 10:26-31) We (under the new covenant) now should give more earnest heed than they (under the old covenant) did.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The warning contains an unanswerable question: (2:3) "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?" The emphasis is properly placed on the we. Those who perished under Moses are a warning to us. The Gospel has brought greater privileges but also greater responsibilities. We should not do despite to God's grace. (10:29)</p>
			<h3>God's Standard is Unchanging</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">God's standard of holiness and righteousness has not been altered and He still expects perfect obedience from His people and more so now (10:25). The fullness of this so GREAT salvation was first proclaimed by Jesus. He both proclaimed the good things of full Salvation and made them possible by His sacrifice.</p>
			<h3>God's Message is Unmistakable</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">This WORD did not cease with the Messiah, but this WORD lived on in His disciples. Matt. 28:18-20; Mark16:15-20; Luke 24:46-49; John 20:21-23; 21:15-17 "Feed them" ALL: My love, My law, My life.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The preaching of the Gospel is continued and confirmed with:</p>
			<h4>SIGNS - He stilled the storm. (He can still every storm.)</h4>
			<h4>WONDERS - Fed 5000 and more with 2 fish and 5 barley loaves.</h4>
			<h4>DIVERSE MIRACLES -Cast out devils, lame walk, dumb speak,blind see, etc.</h4>
			<h4>GIFTS OF THE HOLY GHOST - Christ continues His ministry through gifts of the Holy Ghost given to the Church. ( I Cor. 12:1-11; Eph. 4:11)</h4>
			
			<h2>A Great Salvation</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">God has a Great Plan of Salvation.</p>
			<blockquote>Heb 2:1,3 -- Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. 3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation;</blockquote>
			
			<h2>Great in Its Foundation</h2>
			
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The chief requirement in constructing a sea wall is to get a foundation which can stand unmovable in the heaviest of storms. The shifting sand must be pierced down to granite rock. This harbor has foundations whose builder and maker is God.</p>
			<h3>Jesus is the chief corner stone. (Eph.2:20)</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">It's all fitly framed together inHim. Jesus is the Rock of our Salvation. (Psa. 89:26) Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever (Heb. 13:8).</p>
			
			<h3>The Word of God is the foundation.(John 1:1; Heb. 6:17-19)</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Salvation is founded on two immutable things: Counsel and Oath of God. This foundation is mighty enough to inspire a strong consolation to those who have fled for it through faith for refuge. Gospel – ship; Hope – anchor</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">No matter what storm is raging, God's Word is still in effect!</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The storm clouds of judgment are rising at sea. I Peter 4:17-19 Jude 23; II Peter 3:6,9; Matt.24:37; Matt. 11:28-30 "Come unto me all ye..."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heaven and earth will pass away but not one jot or tittle will pass from God's Word. God's Word is a Rock that can't be moved. A safe, strong and sure foundation.</p>
			<h3>God's Original Plan of Salvation</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">God's original plan was for man to have an eternal life of peace and fellowship with God. Man neglected the Word of God and the Tree of Life; man slipped and fell. (Crossed God and His Word) Jesus was as a Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. (Total obedience) Rev. 13:8 Man's neglectbrought judgment into effect! (Rom. 5:19) Christ's obedience brought God's plan of salvation into effect!</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Salvation is a great word. 1:14;&nbsp;2:3; 2:10; 5:9; 6:9; 9:28Mentioned 6 times in the book of Hebrews. Number6 is the number of man. "Peak of human achievement"</p>
			
			<h3>Salvation is from God for Man. Salvation from the:</h3>
			<h4>Penalty of sin. Rom. 6:23 (like the wind at your back.)</h4>
			<h4>Power of sin. (A perpetual process.) I Cor. 1:18; II Cor.1:10; Rom. 8:2; Eph. 2:1,2; Heb. 2:14</h4>
			<h4>Wrath of God. John 3:36; Rom. 13:11,12</h4>
			<h4>Law of sin. Rom. 8:2 (Not from the Law of God! Lovefulfills the Law!)</h4>
			<h4>Fall. Heb. 2:8-10</h4>
			<h4>Fear of death. Heb. 2:15</h4>
			
			<h2>Great in Its Sweep</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> As you look up and down the harbor, you see many that have anchored in  Jesus. Look at them! They have held on. They have continued to give the more earnest heed.</p>
			<h3>Sufficient to embrace a tested and ruined world.</h3>
			<h3>Room enough for whole navies of souls to ride at anchor.</h3>
			<h3>Space enough for every ship of Adam's race from the shores of time to launch there. LOOK!!!</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Luke 8:2. There was a vessel once manned by seven devils known as the pirate ship of the universe.&nbsp;But captured by the Lord, and at the stern is the name Mary Magdalene.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Luke 23:42. Then we have another ship that had been dismasted; mainsails torn to threads; ship was shattered and sinking almost completely under for the last time when he cried out, "Lord, remember me" The Dying Thief</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Acts 9:6 and 14 Epistles.Find there yet another vessel; one, long determined to tear down the very walls of this great harbor and sink every ship that has been anchored there. But now flying at the very highest point of His ship among the multitudes which no man can number of all nations, kindred, peoples and tongues with the name on the flag in BOLD letters. Chief of sinners and least of saints.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Apostle Paul was completely changed. He went from tearing down to building up -- writing 14 books of theNew Testament.</p>		
			<h2>Great In Its Cost</h2>
			<h3>Illustration #1</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">When the South American Fort was being constructed, thousands of slaves sacrificed their lives. The average life span of a slave was 6 months. They would begin to work knowing in6 months they would be dead. What a price. They mixed with their own hands the body and blood of many slaves knowing one day soon, they would be treatedthe same.</p>
			<h3>Illustration #2</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">In Whales, Great Britain, while building a tubular bridge over the Menai Straits, 500 men perished during the construction. There is a column beside the bridge with all the names of those men that sacrificed their lives. Nothing is said of the money that it cost. The soul is worth more than any amount. These men worked because it was theirjob.The slaves were forced to work. Jesus voluntarily came, died and rose again.</p>
			<h3>The Cost of the Cross</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The harbor of our salvation is the cross. In the middle of its mouth, brightly shining as a flaming sword, so that every ship coming in or drifting away can see the inscription: "IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME" "TheSon of God" who sacrificed His peace, rest, light, love, life for the sins ofthe whole world! What a trade What a provision. What a sacrifice.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">It seems to be an easy thing to besaved, but we don't always remember all that happened before it became so easy.The agony, long hours of prayer, sleepless nights, hungry days, rejection, blasphemy,blood, sweat, tears, the cross, the cries, the burial, THE PRECIOUS COSTLYDEATH! It cost Him His:</p>
			<h4>GLORY (John17:5)</h4>
			<h4>BLOOD (Heb.13:12)</h4>
			<h4>REPUTATION (Phil.2:7)</h4>
			<h4>NATURE (John1:14)</h4>
			<h4>FELLOWSHIP WITHTHE FATHER (Matt. 27:46)</h4>
			<h4>STRENGTH (John10:18)</h4>
			<h4>POSITION INHEAVEN (John 1:24;14:2,3)</h4>
			<h4>RANK (Matt.13:55)</h4>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">IT COST JESUS EVERYTHING! Heb. 1:3 "By Himself" He gave it all up for whosoever that would believe in Him. (1 John1:12) Because he humbled Himself to the condition of humanity, The Believer can now become what He is. (Heb. 2:9,10; 2:1-4)</p>
		<h1>Summary:</h1>
		<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Why is salvation so great? Its magnitude is due to two things: 1) The GREATNESS of the One who proclaimed it, for He is ETERNAL! 2) The great fact that God in the person of His Son suffered for our sins!</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Nothing of old, now or new can parallel or complete our salvation except the BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST! In the former days, man's sins were covered through the animal sacrifices until the righteous penalty for sin should be paid by the RIGHTEOUS LAMB OF GOD! Salvation of old was on credit. Now the bill is paid! Sin, punishment and penalty have been PAID IN FULL! 
					Look who did it!
				
					The only one who could have! The sinless, divine Son!
				
			</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">I Peter 3:18 The JUST died for the unjust. Matt. 1:21 "Thou shalt call His name Jesus" Redemption has been accomplished! God solved your problems at Calvary!</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Salvation could be compared to a GREAT HARBOR where tempest driven souls can find shelter--Rest, Peace, Light,Love, Life</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Conditions out at sea:  Turbulent storms, Tons of icebergs, Tidal waves, Treacherous hail stones, Terrible hurricanes, Tempestuous winds, Thunder, Tornadoes, Tremendous resistance.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Remember making an effort in the right direction does not mean your going forward, especially under these conditions.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Look up and down the shores of time and see the multitudes that have slipped into eternity. LOST!! Many made an effort, but slipped away. Heb. 2:1 "Give the more earnest heed:" Look again up and down the shores right now and see the souls sliding out into eternity. STOP THEM! Watch for people that lose their grip on the Word. SECURE THEM IMMEDIATELY! Get them to look at the harbor! Heb. 12:2 At the right hand of the throne of God. Jesus is the great harbor. "So great salvation" Look! "Give heed" to its greatness.</p>
