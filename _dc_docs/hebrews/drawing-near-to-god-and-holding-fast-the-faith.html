<h1>Drawing Near To God And Holding Fast The Faith -10:19-23</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Heb 10:19 Â¶ Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Faith in Christ</h2>
<p>The full assurance of faith of a new confidence in Christ is determined. This is one of the Better truths shown to us in Hebrews. </p>
<p>It is understandable that the Lord Jesus should enter the Holy of Holies in heaven. It is a wonderful word of welcome, promised to Jew and Gentile to come and worship in the Holy of Holies in heaven. The price of access into this wonderful, glorious place is by the blood of Jesus. </p>
<h2>Boldness in Christ</h2>
<p>We must Boldly Approach the throne of Grace through faith in Christ.</p>
<h3>Boldness to enter by the Blood of Jesus,</h3>
<h3>Boldness to enter through His broken flesh, His rent side, His laid down life.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Heb 10:20 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</p>
