			<h1>Sympathy with men. 5:1-3</h1>
				<h2>Compassion on the ignorant</h2>
				<h2>Compassion on them that are out of the way</h2>
			
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">A priest has compassion because he himself is compassed with infirmity.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Man brought sin into the world, and it was necessary that deliverance meet certain qualification.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The order of Christ's priesthood differs from the Levitical priests,  both were chosen from among men and accepted by God, but  watch! </p>
				<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">but watch!  “Jesus the Son of God”</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Stress has already been placed on the true humanity of Jesus.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">He was chosen from among those whomHe was to represent before God.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">As Priest, Jesus was "ordained for men." 5:1 (Jesus the Son of God was Appointed to act on behalf of man before God.)</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The offerings of Jesus, like those of the Old Testament Priest, are described as "gifts and sacrifices for sins."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">1. "gifts"- all offerings, bloodless or bloody</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 2. "sacrifices" - the shedding of blood of the victim</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Christ obeyed the Father through His whole life even to sacrifice and be sacrificed at Calvary.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> "OBEDIENT UNTO DEATH"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Note: Allpriests must have a sacrifice.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> The ministry of thepriest is one of compassion. 5:2</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Sympathy itself is aform of suffering.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">  It's a gift to have.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> It's a giftto give.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> It also canbe a sacrifice.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The priest does not side with the sinneragainst the righteous demands of the Holy God, but he does show a sympathy withthe  sinner at the very time he expresses by word and act, severity towardsin. Rom. 11:22</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Compassion is expressed toward the"ignorant" and them that are  out of the way. The Levitical offerings madeprovision for the one  who sinned in ignorance. Num. 15:27-31, not for the soul that doeth aught presumptuously. The soul that sins in ignorance may experience sympathy from God and discipline to bring him to the place of obedience to God'swill. The soul that rebels meets judgment.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Restoration to divine favor is onlypossible after repentance.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> Mark 1:15 Luke13:3,5</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 2. Called of God 5:4-10</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Remember it's a divine call, not apersonal choice. "No man take this honor unto himself." You must be called ofGod for this ministry.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">It's not achoice to choose. It's not a choice to refuse.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The office of the Great High Priestwas by Divine appointment. Jesus, although not of the line of Aaron was clearlycalled as High Priest.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 5:5 Psa. 2:7 Matt.3:17; 17:5 Mark 1:11 Luke 3:22</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">He was to be heard and obeyed.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">To be more specific concerningChrist's Priesthood. Heb. 5:6 Psa. 110:4</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Thou art a Priest forever after theorder of Melchizedek.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Although all Priests in Israel hadto be in the line of Aaron.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The law before Aaron spoke of aPriest who was recognized by Abraham. Gen. 14:20</p>
			<blockquote>Hebrews 7:14 -- Itis evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses spoke nothingconcerning Priesthood. </blockquote>
			<blockquote>Hebrews 7:15 -- Andit is far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek therearises another Priest. </blockquote>
			<blockquote>Hebrews 7:17 -- Whois made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of anendless life." </blockquote>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 7:21,28 "The sum" Heb. 8:1-2</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 5:10 "Called of God after the order of Melchizedek."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">JESUS DID NOT CHOOSE 5:5</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">JESUS DID NOT REFUSE 5:7-9</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;"> 3. Possess the Knowledge of Experience</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">All of the sinless infirmities ofthe human race were shared by Jesus. Heb. 2:18; 4:15; 5:7 He experienced thepangs of hunger at the very beginning of His ministry, Mark 11:12, and utteredthe cry "I thirst" at the close. John 19:28</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">He desired most the friendshipand loyalty of His disciples, but they all forsook Him and fled. Peter, Jamesand John (the inner circle) did not watch with Him one hour in the garden. Luke22:45 Judas betrayed Him for thirty pieces of silver. Matt. 27:3</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">He did mighty works in Capernaum,but they still rejected Him and so did Nazareth, the city of His youth.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">He experienced poverty from themoment of His birth in a stable in Bethlehem to His burial in Joseph's tomb. Matt.27:57-61</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">It was said of Him "the Son of manhath not where to lay His head." Matt. 8:20</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 5:7 What challenging pictureof the human Jesus struggling in prayer. We see the Savior offering "prayersand supplications" 5:7 This verse expresses a heart burdened at the prospect ofimpending calamity. Luke 22:53</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Think of it, there would be no hopefor mankind if Christ would not have gone to the cross, arose the third daymorning and made it possible for every believer to escape death and be freefrom sin. Jesus tasted death, but in so doing He opened up the way of Eternallife.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The temptations of Jesus "in allpoints" included the issues of death, but He accepted the Father's will and"for the joy that was set before Him" endured it's agonies.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 5:7 "in that Hefeared"Fear...a positive virtue. It's the response of every individual thatproperly perceives the nature of God and the demands He makes on Hiscreatures.Your fear is shown by your consistent obedience. I Sam. 3:17-18 Lestit happen to him.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">"But we see Jesus" The submissiveand obedient man, Christ Jesus.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The Savior stood in reverential awebefore the revelation of the Father's will, accepted it and acted upon it.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Discipline is a mark of Sonship.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The result of the successfulaccomplishment of the High-priestly mission of Jesus is "eternal salvation untoall them that obey Him."</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 5:9 "made perfect"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Heb. 5:8 "learned He obedience" </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">How?...... by the things that Hesuffered.</p>
