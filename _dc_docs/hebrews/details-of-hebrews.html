<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Hebrews has been referred to as the "Fifth Gospel" because it declares Jesus' finished work on earth and His continuing work. Hebrews begins like an essay, proceeds like a sermon, and ends as a letter. The epistle abounds in contrasts of the Son and angels, prophets, priests, and apostles. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Hebrews was written originally to correct a spiritual condition of backsliding in a congregation of believers living in the first century. The same warning signs given for the first century are still standing for the last generation. Today, as in the first century, Satan is tempting Christians to turn away from simple faith in Christ, trying to depreciate in the minds of people the glory of the Person and the Work of the Lord Jesus Christ; and to compare religions with Christianity.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">In Hebrews, ample warnings are given saying Christianity is superior to Judaism and other religions. The immeasurable satisfaction and blessing of living with Jesus Christ cannot be found anywhere else. ALL religions, forms, practices, and ceremonies must step aside and REPENT! Heb. 13:10.</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The altar we now have is through FAITH in the BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST that was shed on the CROSS of CALVARY! Rom.3:25; Heb. 13:20 "Through the Blood of the Everlasting Covenant" The new "purges our sins" 1:3. The new "opened up a new and living way" 10:19,20; 4:16. More excellent ministry, better covenant and better promises 8:6</p>

			<h2>Date Written: 64-70 A.D.</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The context of the epistle throughout 5:1-6; 7-10 assumes that the temple is still standing and the whole sacrificial system were then in their normal operation. 8:13 shows that they were waxing old and vanishing away in 70 A.D.</p>

			<h2>God's Final Message to Judaism</h2>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Remember, Jerusalem is without a Pastor and Jerusalem will soon be destroyed including the temple (70 AD).</p>
			<h3>The old was decaying and vanishing away. (8:13)</h3>
			<h3>In a time of adversity (13:3)</h3>
			<h3>Some in prison, many suffering adversity</h3>
			<h3>A reminder of the prophets of old (11:33-38)</h3>
			<h3>Ye have not (yet) resisted unto blood (12:4)</h3>
			<h3>Call to remembrance the former days ye endured a great fight of affliction.(10:32)</h3>
			<h3>Get back to your first love (13:3)</h3>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">Paul saw the gap that was created when James, the pastor in Jerusalem was tortured to death for his faith inChrist in 62 AD. James (the Just) was the overseer in Jerusalem, the Lord's brother. James spent so much time on his knees praying, his knees were callused like camels' knees. The Scribes and Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin together,took counsel against James and demanded that he proclaim from one of the galleries, that Jesus was not the Messiah. He cried Jesus is the Son of God and Judge of the world. They threw him to the ground from the gallery, stoned him with stones, beat him with a club, while he cried, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Then his life expired. The Christians were faced with many changes in persons and temptations.</p>
