			<h1>A.    Hisentrance into the true sanctuary 8:1-5</h1>
			<h2>1     The earthly structure was not the true sanctuary for it was pitched byman. 8:2</h2>
			<h2>2     The Holy Spirit directed the building of the earthly temple as a shadowof the true. Heb. 8:4,5; I Kings 8:27 As glorious as it was, it was not theeternal abode of God.</h2>
			<h2>3     The High Priest by virtue of His office approached God with a sacrifice.Prayer and sacrifice were his prime responsibilities. The prophet stood beforethe people as God's representative. The priest stood before God representingthe people.</h2>
			<h2>4     Heaven is the place of Christ's high priestly ministry. 8:1 "In theheavens"</h2>
			<h3>a.      He was concerned with the throne of majesty while the earthly priestworked among the likeness and types and shadows. 8:45 The earthly is only apattern of the heavenly. The Christ is our Heavenly Priest.</h3>
			<h3>b.     Christ is a direct revelation from Heaven in the person of Jesus. John1:14 "He dwelt" tabernacled among men that bore witness of His glory. Jesus isthe substance of what the earthly tabernacle was a shadow. Jesus is not areflection of Heavenly reality, but is the SON OF GOD – Emanuel, God with us.</h3>
			<h3>c.      "The Sum" 8:1, 4, 6, 12. Christ is our High Priest set on the right handof the throne of the majesty in heaven; a minister of the true tabernacle witha more excellent ministry than the shadow of the Law, but full of grace andtruth. "Majesty" 8:1; 8:6. Mediator of a better covenant. </h3>

			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">The new covenant – the power ofGrace – Reality ("I will be merciful" 8:12)</p>
			<h1>B.     Priestof the new covenant 8:6-13</h1>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">7:22 "a better testament"; 8:6 "a better covenant"; 8:10"this is the covenant"</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; text-indent:.5in;">8:6 "more excellent ministry"; 4:14-7:28 Greatness of Hisperson &amp; 8:1-10:18 Ministry</p>
			<h2>1     The chief point "Sum" 8:1. "We have such a High Priest" The Jews weresaying to the young converts, you have nothing. No High Priest, altar,sanctuary, sacrifice "We have a great High Priest" 4:14 "We have such an HighPriest"</h2>
