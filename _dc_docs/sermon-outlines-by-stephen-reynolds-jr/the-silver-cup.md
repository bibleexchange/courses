##I. The Foundation

###A. Joseph Teaches us About Jesus Christ
(longed for son, firstborn, sold by his brethren for pieces of silver, His birth inspired faith, tested, falsely accused, his own brethren sought to kill Him, After He suffered He rose to a throne, HE OVERCAME HIS DIFFICULTIES)

###B. The Steward Teaches us About the Holy Ghost

(The Holy Ghost takes the things of Christ and makes them the Believer's.)

> John 16:13-14 -- Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. 14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

> Genesis 43:23a And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks:...

###C. The Sacks Teach Us About the Spiritual Experience of the Christian.

> Genesis 44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. (I Cor. 6:19 Know ye not your body is the temple...)

###D. The Silver Cup Teaches Us About the Influence of the Spirit on the Christian -- GIFTS and FRUIT.
(It is one object - a silver cup - that is placed by the steward in Benjamin's sack, but it represents the MANY spiritual Gifts.)

###E. Benjamin Teaches Us About the Christian Who Inherits All that Christ Has Provided. He is an OVERCOMER that OVERCOMES as Christ did.

##II. Spiritual Gifts are the Inheritance of the Believer

###A. These ARE GIFTS. (Their MONEY is returned to them. Rightfully Theirs By BIRTHRIGHT--His brethren!)

###B. Each is Given AS MUCH AS THEY CAN CARRY.

###C. These Spiritual Gifts Create UNITY in the Family of God and BUILDS up the individual. (Contrasting the works of the flesh which cause division.)

These Gifts God has given to the church are NECESSARY and not OPTIONAL.

> 1 Corinthians 12:1 -- Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

> Ephesians 4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

> Ephesian 4:11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

> 1 Corinthians 12:28 -- And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

###D. It is the work of the Holy Ghost deliver these gifts to the Believer.

1Co 12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.

###E. It is the Responsibility of the Christian to Seek Earnestly the Best Gift.

> 1 Corinthians 12:31a But covet earnestly the best gifts:...

> Hebrews 6:1,2 -- Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 2 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

####What is the best gift? Salvation, Faith, Victory, Wisdom, Healing, Prophecy = The BEST GIFT is the one you need right now!

> Hebrews 6:19-20 -- Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; 20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

The Forerunner entered beyond the HOLY PLACE into the HOLIEST OF HOLIES.

##CONCLUSION:
Search Will Be Made and God Will Reward the Overcomer. He will be looking for that SILVER CUP. What's in your sack?

> Luke 21:36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
