# He is Risen Indeed
TEXT: Luke 24:32-34; 1 Corinthians 15

> Luke 24:34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. (1 Corinthians 15:1-58)

## The Victory of Resurrection

Luke 24:13 
- Two men walking to Emmaus
- They talked together of all these things which had happened. 
- Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
- What are talking about that saddens you so?
- 3 days ago the chief priests and our rulers delivered Jesus to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
- Certain women also of our company said they found the sepulchre empty
- And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: 
- Jesus then rebukes them for their unbelief in what the Scripture clearly foretold that Christ should die.
- He broke bread with them and then vanished.

> 32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.**

## The Danger of Error - The Context of 1 Corinthians 15

date 1 Corinthians written: After founding the church in Corinth, Paul spent 3 years in Ephesus. During this time (53-57 AD) Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. 1 Corinthians might have been the first written Scriptural account of the Resurrection of Jesus.

Paul wrote this letter to correct erroneous views in the church at Corinth concerning: Division in the Church, Immorality, Marriage, Christian Liberty, Worship and concludes with defending and explaining the importance of the Resurrection.

Paul implores them as a father.

> 1 Corinthians 4:14 ¶ I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons **I warn you**. 15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. 16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. 17 ¶ For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.

Error Concerning Christ's resurrection is a present concern today:

- "Not all Christians believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus."

##vs. 1-4 Christ died, was buried, rose again

1Co 15:1 ¶ Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day **according to the scriptures**:

Denial is nothing NEW!

"There is no Resurrection at all" and "Marriage after Death". Mark 12:18-27

**HIS DEATH CERTIFICATE** - HE WAS DEAD
A Lifeless body was placed in the grave. Mark 15:46-47; Luke 23:50-56

**HIS RESURRECTION CERTIFICATE** - HE IS RISEN INDEED
> Luke 24:34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

## vs. 5-11 Witnesses of His Resurrection

Evidences of a Risen Christ

- There is the Empty Tomb
- You wanted to create a hoax in the first century you wouldn't use a woman. (her testimony in a court was as good as a thief's)
- 500 people is a lot of people, Many still alive at the time of the writings, "Go ask them what they saw".
- Christianity prospered and spread from out of Jerusalem. The impact of Christ's resurrection or absence of any impact would be plain to those living there. If a hoax, no way Christianity would flourish there.
- Many believers (including all the apostles except John and Judas) were martyred for the testimony to the RESURRECTION of Jesus. A message of truth, worth dying for.

> 1Co 15:30 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?

Most of what we know about the Resurrection of Jesus was written by Paul, Mark, Matthew, Luke and John.

**55 1 Corinthians (15)** - **Paul** was an eye-witness of the Resurrected Christ
**48-70 Mark (15:46-47; 16:1-20)** - **Mark** was a disciple of Peter and quite possibly his interpreter
**50-70 Matthew (27:59-66; 28:1-20)** - **Matthew** was 1 of the 12 apostles and eyewitness to the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.
**57-62 Luke (23:52-56; 24:1-53)** - **Luke** was a gentile companion of the apostle Paul who interviewed eyewitnesses
**62-63 Acts (1:1-11; 2:31-36)**
**90's John (19:38-42; 20:1-31; 21:1-25)** - **John** was 1 of the 12 Apostles of Christ an eyewitness to the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.

## vs. 12-19 Resurrection is the Crux of Christianity

-  "I have friends who I am quite sure are Christians who do not believe in the bodily resurrection,” says the Reverend N. T. Wright, "

> Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

The problem isn't merely a denial of Christ's resurrection, but it is an increasing rejection of FAITH at all that we face. The Resurrection of Christ is not only foundational, but **essential** to Christianity.

The Resurrection of Jesus is CENTRAL to our faith.

The Resurrection of Jesus is the primary proof and evidence of the Gospel.

## vs. 20-34 The Believer has the Hope of Resurrection

Romans 6:3-5&mdash; Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

## vs. 35-50 With what Body does one Resurrected come (Seeing as this body is corruptible)? A seed in the ground. Sown in corruption, but raised in incorruption.

what kind of Resurrection is this? (Luke 24:39,40 a spirit hath not flesh and bones)

## Conclusion

Historically, has been used as a greeting in place of "hello" or other similar greetings. "Christ is Risen" is met with the response "He is Risen Indeed!"
