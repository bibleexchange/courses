<h1 id="_Introduction">Introduction to Church History</h1>

<p> Jesus said: “upon this rock Iwill build My Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” –Matthew 16:18.  Jesus is talking to Peter&#44; but Peter is not the rock foundationof the Church.  JESUS IS THE ROCK UPON WHICH THE CHURCH IS BUILT!  Jesus is thestone which the builder’s rejected&#44; and the chief cornerstone.</p>
<p  >&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>Acts 4:11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders&#44; which is become the head of the corner.</p>
<p  >&nbsp;</p>
<p  >This class will help the studentto become familiar with the history of the Church. The goal of this class is togive you a practical understanding of events that occurred throughout thehistory of the Church.  The Church of Jesus Christ is alive.  We will study thelives of some of the people who have been used of God as pillars in the Church.</p>
<h2>I. Definition of Church History</h2>
<h3>A. Church. the Greek word for church is Ekklesia which means those called together or those called out.</h3>
<p>This class will study the true church of Jesus Christ. The word church is used today to refer to the buildings that the saints gather in to worship&#44; but it more accurately refers to the people. The Scripture uses the word church to refer to an assembly in a certain house or city. (Romans 16:5&#44; I Cor. 16:19&#44; Col. 4:15) The Church is more than a houseor building&#44; but is the saints who are the Body of Christ.</p>
<h4>1. The Lord added to the Church.</h4>
<blockquote>Acts 2:47…And the Lord added to the churchdaily such as should be saved.</blockquote>
<p>After experiencing the great Baptism of the Holy Ghost inthe Upper Room&#44; the Disciples were powerfully influential in witnessing ofChrist. In one day&#44; 3&#44;000 souls were saved and added to the local assembly.Every day&#44; more and more were added!</p>

<h4>2. Jesus is the head of the Church.</h4>

<p  >Ephesians1:22-23—<i>And hath put all things under his feet&#44; and gave him to be the headover all things to the church&#44; Which is his body…</i></p>

<p>The Church is referred to in thisScripture as the body of Christ.  Jesus is the head of His Body.  In a physicalbody the head gives commands to the body to function and work.  In the body ofChrist&#44; Jesus is the Commander who gives instructions to His Church to do thework of God.</p>
<h4>3.TheChurch consists of Believers who have been baptized in the Holy Ghost.  </h4>

<p  >I Corinthians12:13—<i>For <u>by one Spirit</u> are we all <u>baptized into</u> one body…</i></p>

<p>According to Ephesians 1: 22&#44;23&#44;the Church is the Body of Christ. I Corinthians 12:13 tells us that we arebaptized into the Body by the Holy Spirit. According to this Scripture&#44; weunderstand that it takes the baptism or infilling of the Holy Ghost to do thework of God as part of the Body of Christ. In summary:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We are saved by the Blood of Jesus Christ.</h5>
<p  >Colossians 1:14 In whom we have redemption through his blood&#44; even the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p  >&nbsp;</p>
<h5>b. A physical church is a local assembly of Believers who gather together for worship.</h5>

<h5>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yet&#44; according to I Corinthians 12:13&#44; we need the Holy Ghost Baptism to be active in the mystical Body/Church of Christ. </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Church is not the physical one&#44; but spiritual. We are born into the family of God and we are baptized bythe Holy Ghost into the Body or Church of Christ. The Body or Church enjoys a deeper relationship with Christ than that of the family relationship when weare born of God.</p>
<p>4. The Church began on the day ofPentecost.   </p>
<p>Acts 2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come&#44; they were all with one accord in one place. </p>
<p>The Church was birthed by the HolyGhost on the Day of Pentecost. This class will include the study of the earlyChurch of Acts up to our current Church period.</p>
<h3>B. History– the word history comes from a word that means learning by inquiry.</h3>
<h4>1. The Webster’s dictionary defines history as: that branch of knowledge which deals with events that have taken place in the world’s existence; the study or investigation of the past.</h4>

<h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>HIS STORY – The birth&#44; life&#44; death&#44; and resurrection of Christ is thecentral event of the history of the world. History is recorded around Christ;dates are listed as BC (before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini) which is Latin thatmeans in the year of our Lord.  All of history centers on Christ.</h4>

<h3>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Christian– We are studying the history of the Christian Church.</h3>
<h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>The term Christian meaning tobe like Christ or one who follows Christ was first used inAntioch around AD 40. </h4><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"&#44;"serif"'><brclear=all style='page-break-before:always'></span>

<h2>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why StudyChurch History?</h2>
<p><span style=''>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The study of Church history gives us an appreciation of our heritage. Manymen and woman have paid the price of their lives to carry this Gospel message. TheGospel has been preached through much difficulty and hardship.</h3>

<h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.25in'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The repeat of history. History comes in cycles. By studying the past wecan learn about the present. We can learn from the mistakes and successes ofothers. God is no respecter of persons. What God has performed for pastgenerations He can do for our generation if we obey Him as they did.</h3>

<p>Romans 2:11 For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>

<h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What God required of men yesterday; He will still require today. Goddeals with all men equally in all ages and at all times.  How God dealt withmen in times past is how He will still deal with men today. God has alwaysrequired that men live a Holy life and he has not changed that standard today.</h4>

<h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>God uses ordinary people. The same God that used Peter&#44; and James&#44; andJohn is the same God that will use you.  God uses ordinary people just likeyou.</h4>

<h3>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Tobuild up our faith.</h3>

<h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Learn of the mighty revivals of the church. There have been some greatmanifestations of God’s power throughout the course of the history of the church. The same Holy Ghost that moved in those revivals is the same Holy Ghost thatwill move today.</h4>

<h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You can see that God’s hand has always been on His Church.</h4>

<h3>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Toenrich the knowledge of the minister.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A minister of the Gospel should notbe ignorant of the rich history of the Church. Seeing God at work in historycan give us an understanding of how God works. God is in control of His Story. Nothing happens unless God wills it.  Those that fight against the will of God cannotwin.  No devil in hell can stop the will and plan of God.</p>

<p  >Daniel 2:21 Andhe changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings&#44; and setteth up kings:he giveth wisdom unto the wise&#44; and knowledge to them that know understanding:</p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"&#44;"serif"'><brclear=all style='page-break-before:always'></span>

<h2>III.     The Seven Periods of Church History</h2>
<p  align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The history of the Church isdivided into seven periods of time. These are not just man’s divisions ofChurch history&#44; but these are God’s divisions that He has given to us in HisWord.  The Book of Revelation describes seven Churches in Asia.  </p>
<p  style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'>&nbsp;</p>
<p  >Revelation1:11 Saying&#44; I am Alpha and Omega&#44; the first and the last: and&#44; What thouseest&#44; write in a book&#44; and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia;unto Ephesus&#44; and unto Smyrna&#44; and unto Pergamos&#44; and unto Thyatira&#44; and untoSardis&#44; and unto Philadelphia&#44; and unto Laodicea.</p>
<p  >&nbsp;</p>
<p>These seven Churches are describedindividually from Revelation 2:1 to Revelation 3:22.  These seven Churchesdescribe and parallel the seven periods of the history of the Church.  They area prophetic overview of the entire history of the church from the first centuryAD until the current period of time today.  It is important to note that theseperiods do tend to overlap one another and elements from all the church periodscan be found in each individual period. With this being said&#44; each period has adistinct and dominant ‘personality.’</p>
<p>The key to understanding themeaning of these seven Churches is to compare the events of the seven periodsof the Church to the description given in the book of Revelation of these sevenChurches.  These chapters in the book of Revelation will be the key texts of thiscourse.  Each of these seven churches corresponds to a distinct period inhistory.  As we begin to study each church description in the Bible and compareit to the events that took place in the history of that period&#44; you will beginto understand how these seven churches represent seven distinct periods in thehistory of the Church. Each of these church names has a corresponding meaning. The meaning of the names describes that period as a whole. </p>
<p>The following is a list of theseven periods with their corresponding church name and the meaning of thatname.  There is also a description of events that mark the beginning and endingof the period with the corresponding dates.  (You will not be required to memorizethese dates; they are given for the benefit of your personal study.)            </p>
<p  style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in'> </p>
<p><b>1.         THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH – Ephesus –“desirable”</b></p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>START: From the Day of Pentecost 30 AD</p>

<p>The first period we will study isthe Apostolic period which corresponds to the Ephesus church.  The word Ephesusmeans desirable.  Ephesus is referred to as the model church.  Jesusgives words of encouragement and also instruction to each of the Churches. Jesus has many good things to say about this church.  The description given byJesus is very desirable. (Revelation 2:1-7)  Jesus admonishes this Church thatthey have left their first love. The early Church lacked a missionary vision. There was no effort to go into the entire world and preach the Gospel.  ThisChurch period left their first love of the souls of men.  God would allowpersecution to come to cause the Believers to spread out and therefore resultin a greater spread of the Gospel.</p><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"&#44;"serif"'><brclear=all style='page-break-before:always'></span></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>2.         THE PERSECUTED CHURCH – Smyrna – “crushed”</b></p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>START: From the completion of the N.T. about 100 AD</p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>END: To the Edict of Constantine 313 AD</p>

<p>The Persecuted period correspondsto the Smyrna Church.  The word Smyrna means crushed.  This is a period oftremendous persecution of the Church.  The Church was <b>crushed</b> beneaththe iron heal of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p><b>3.         THE IMPERIAL CHURCH – Pergamos - “married”</b></p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>START: From the Edict of Constantine 313 AD</p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>END: To the Fall of Rome 476 AD</p>

<p>The word Imperial refers to a kingor ruler.  The Imperial period corresponds to the Pergamos Church. This was aperiod in the history of the Church that an emperor had much influence on theChurch. The word Pergamos means married. This is a period of thebeginning of compromise in the Church.  The Church became married to paganism. The Church name describes the condition of compromise that prevailed duringthis period.  This paganism would later become the Roman Catholic Church.  Wewill not study the history of the Roman Catholic Church specifically&#44; but wewill look at how the it affected the true Church.</p>

<p><b>4.         THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH – Thyatira – “continualsacrifice”</b></p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>START: From the Fall of Rome 476 AD</p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>END: To the Fall of Constantinople 1453 AD</p>

<p>There are certain terms of historythat will be used in this class.  Medieval is a term used to describe themiddle age of history which is also called the dark ages.  The Medieval periodcorresponds to the Thyatira church.  The word Thyatira means continualsacrifice.  The Catholic church dominated Europe during this time.  The phrase“continual sacrifice” describes the continual sacrifice of the Roman Catholicwafer during mass.  The Catholics falsely teach that Jesus is sacrificed eachweek during the mass.  Again&#44; the meaning of the name Thyatira describes theprevailing factor of the period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5.         THE REFORMED CHURCH – Sardis – “remnant”</b></p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>START: From the Fall of Constantinople 1453 AD</p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>END: To the End of the Thirty Year War 1678 AD</p>

<p>The Reformed period corresponds tothe Sardis Church.  The word Sardis means remnant.  There was still a remnantthat was serving God.  Jesus told them to strengthen the things that remain. This was a period when God used men like Martin Luther to stand up against thetide of Catholicism and preach the just shall live by faith.  God raised up menthroughout Europe to restore the Word to the Church.  The Medieval period was adark period.  The world even refers to that period as the dark ages.  Godturned on the light. It took the light of the Word of God to bring Europe outof the dark ages.  </p>

<p><b>6.         THE MODERN CHURCH – Philadelphia – “brotherlylove”</b></p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>START: From the end of the Thirty Year War 1678 AD</p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>END: To the Twentieth Century 1950’s AD</p>

<p>The Modern period corresponds tothe Philadelphia Church.  The word Philadelphia means brotherly love.  This wasa period of great revivals and missionary outreach.  Up until this time therewas never a concentrated effort to reach the world with the Gospel.  It takes agreat love of souls to travel to a foreign land and preach the Gospel.  It wasduring this time that David Livingstone set up many missionary stations on thecontinent of Africa.</p>

<p><b>7.         THE LAODICEAN CHURCH – Laodicea – “rule bythe people”</b></p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>START: From the Twentieth Century 1950’s AD</p>
<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in;'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>END: To the present day</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>We use the Biblical name of theChurch to refer to this period.  The word Laodicea means rule by the people. Today many churches are run by the people and not the pastors.  Thus thedescription of the period is again described in the meaning of the name – ruleby the people.  Jesus described this church as being lukewarm.  The conditionof the church as a whole today is defiantly lukewarm.</p>
<p>Each of these seven churchesprophetically describes a period that would come to the church.  John receivedthis revelation in AD 100.  Today we are living in the Laodicean period.  Thisis not just a study of dead facts and dates that have no meaning.  We need tounderstand the Word of God.  By understanding the meaning of these sevenchurches described in the Book of Revelation; we can understand that Jesus wasreferring to our day when He rebuked the Laodicean Church.  </p>
<p>We will study each of these periodsindividually.  This chapter was only an overview of what this course willcover.      </p>

<p><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “continualsacrifice” of mass was part of the seduction of this period.</h3>

<p>Roman Catholic doctrine states thatChrist instituted the Eucharist as an atoning or propitiatory work. </p>
<p>“The victim is one and thesame:…only the manner of offering is different. And since in this divinesacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass&#44; the same Christ who offered himselfonce in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross is contained and offered inan unbloody manner... <b>this sacrifice is truly propitiatory</b>&quot; (Doctrinade ss. Missae sacrificio&#44; c. 2&#44; quoted in Catechism of the CatholicChurch&#44; 1367).[Christ instituted the Eucharist.] He did this in order toperpetuate the sacrifice of the Cross throughout the centuries until he shouldcome again. (1992 Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church)</p>
<p><span >Thyatirameans continual sacrifice</span>. This refers to the Roman Catholic massor Eucharistic celebration. The mass became a continual sacrifice forthe living and the dead. Roman Catholic doctrine claims that the wafer and wineliterally turn into the body and blood of Jesus and must be “perpetuallyoffered” until His return for there to be atonement for sin. Although theywould rather say that mass is not so much a ‘continual sacrifice’ as a‘perpetual re-presenting’ of the blood and body of Christ&#44; they in practicedenounce the sufficiency and sovereignty of Christ’s work on the cross inrequiring any further work .  We by faith receive the atoning work of Christbecause his sacrificial death was sufficient. The keeping of the Lord’s supperis not an atoning work or <b>propitiatory</b>&#44; but is a memorial feast andact of obedience. Jesus offered Himself once and for all  (Heb. 7:27) and hisdeath and resurrection are <b>memorialized</b> in communion. There is nopropitiation necessary beyond Christ’s ministry on the cross.</p>

<h3>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thespirit that Jezebel carried seduced many Believers to idolatry and fornication.</h3>

<p  >Revelation2:20 …thou sufferest that woman Jezebel&#44; which calleth herself a prophetess&#44;to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificedunto idols. </p>
<p>Notice it is the servants of Jesuswho are being taught and seduced to commit fornication and idolatry.</p>
<p>Queen Jezebel was already dead at thetime of this writing.  This Scripture refers to the seductive and false worshipspirit of Jezebel and not specifically the O.T. queen.</p>
