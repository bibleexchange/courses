<h1>Jude</h1>
<h2>General Details</h2>
<h3>Who it was written to:</h3>
<p>To believers in general</p>
<h3>Why written:</h3>
<p>To warn them against apostates within the church who, though having denied the faith, still retained their membership.</p>
<h3>Theme:</h3>
<p>The duty of Christians to keep themselves spotless and to contend earnestly for the faith in the midst of apostasy</p>
<p>There is a similarity between Peter’s second letter and that of Jude; they both deal with apostasy in the church and describe the leaders of that apostasy.  Dealing with this subject it seems that Jude quotes from Peter.  (Compare II Peter 3:3 and Jude 18)  They both describe the same kind of false teachers – men of loose morals and shameful excesses.  Also Peter describes a future apostasy whereas Jude speaks of it as present.  Peter describes the false teachers as godless and extremely dangerous but not at their worst.  Jude describes them as depraved and as lawless as they can be.  Also it is interesting to note that Jude quotes directly from the book of Enoch, which is otherwise not part of the Bible canon. He cites Enoch's prophecy that the Lord would come with many thousands of his saints to render judgment on the whole world. He also paraphrases an incident in a text that has been lost about Satan and Michael quarrelling over the body of Moses.</p>
<h3>When written:</h3>

<h2>Admonition and conclusion   17-25</h2>
<h2>Introduction   1-2</h2>
<p>The author of this letter is believed to be Jude, the brother of James and the half brother of Jesus.  Mark 6:3  Jude begins this letter with a fairly formal introduction of himself  calling himself by name and identifying himself as, “the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James”.</p>
<h2>Warnings against the false   3-16</h2>
<p>At first, Jude had intended to write to them concerning “the common salvation”, but because of the presence of false teachers, he had felt the need to warn them to contend for the truths of the Gospel v. 3-4.</p>
<p>Jude illustrates the doom of such teachers by giving three examples from the Old Testament, namely His own people that believed not, the angels that kept not their first estate and Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them (v. 5-7).  These men who continually gave themselves to their own sinful desires were guilty of fleshly sin and of rebellion against authority (v. 8) and spoke of authority in terms that Michael the archangel did not dare to use in addressing Satan (v. 9).  These speak evil of things they do not understand and in the things they do understand by mere natural instinct, in these things they defile themselves (v. 10).  Scripture (v. 11) and nature (vs. 12-13) prefigure their sin and their doom.  These are the ones that Enoch prophesied of (v. 14-15).  Jude describes these men as men who grumble and complain, who are not content with their lot in life, men who go after their own desires and are controlled by their passions, they are boastful and arrogant and show admiration for men’s persons and pay people flattering compliments to gain advantage.  They create divisions, are utterly fleshly (carnal) and do not have the Spirit of Christ (vs. 16-19).</p>
<h2>Admonition and conclusion   17-25</h2>
<p>Jude reminds the believers of the words of apostles in the past who had warned them of such men and admonishes them to build themselves up in the faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, continue in God’s love, ever looking to Jesus (vs. 20-21).  Their attitude toward those in error is they should have compassion on the weak ones who have wavered and others they are to save by great effort, but always watchful lest they should be defiled with the filthy garments of tainted doctrine and sensual living (vs. 22-23).</p>
<p>Jude concludes by praising Him who is able to keep the believer from falling into apostasy and sin and who is able to present him blameless before His presence (vs. 24-25).</p>
