class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>WHEN at the first 
I took my pen in hand<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Thus for to write, I did not understand<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>That I at all should 
make a little book<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>In such a mode: nay, I had undertook<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>To make another; 
which, when almost done,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Before I was aware I this begun.<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And thus it was: 
I, writing of the way<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And race of saints in this our gospel-day,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Fell suddenly into 
an allegory<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>About their journey, and the way to glory,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>In more than twenty 
things which I set down<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>This done, I twenty more had in my crown,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And they again began 
to multiply,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Like sparks that from the coals of fire do fly.<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Nay, then, thought 
I, if that you breed so fast,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I’ll put you by yourselves, lest you at last<SPAN

out<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>The book 
that I already am about.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Well, so I did; but yet I did not think<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>To show to all the 
world my pen and ink<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>In such a mode; I only thought to make<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I knew not what: nor 
did I undertake<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Thereby to please my neighbor; no, not I;<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I did it my own self 
to gratify.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Neither did I but vacant seasons spend<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>In this my scribble; 
nor did I intend<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>But to divert myself, in doing this,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>From worser 
thoughts, which make me do amiss.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Thus I set pen to paper with delight,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And quickly had my 
thoughts in black and white;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>For having now my method by the end,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Still as I pull’d, 
it came; and so I penned<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>It down; until it came at last to be,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>For length and 
breadth, the bigness which you see.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Well, when I had thus put mine ends together<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I show’d them 
others, that I might see whether<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>They would condemn them, or them justify:<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And some said, let 
them live; some, let them die:<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Some said, John, print it; others said, Not so:<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Some said, It might 
do good; others said, No.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Now was I in a strait, and did not see<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Which was the best 
thing to be done by me:<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>At last I thought, Since ye are thus divided,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I print it will; and 
so the case decided.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>For, thought I, some I see would have it done,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Though others in 
that channel do not run:<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>To prove, then, who advised for the best,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Thus I thought fit 
to put it to the test.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I further thought, if now I did deny<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Those that would 
have it, thus to gratify;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I did not know, but hinder them I might<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Of that which would 
to them be great delight.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>For those which were not for its coming forth,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I said to them, 
Offend you, I am loath;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Yet since your brethren pleased with it be,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Forbear to judge, 
till you do further see.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>If that thou wilt not read, let it alone;<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Some love the meat, 
some love to pick the bone.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Yea, that I might them better palliate,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I did too with them 
thus expostulate:<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>May I not write in such a style as this?<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>In such a method 
too, and yet not miss<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>My end-thy good? Why may it not be done?<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Dark clouds bring 
waters, when the bright bring none.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Yea, dark or bright, if they their silver drops<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Cause to descend, 
the earth, by yielding crops,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Gives praise to both, and carpeth not at either,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>But treasures up the 
fruit they yield together;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Yea, so commixes both, that in their fruit<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>None can distinguish 
this from that; they suit<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Her well when hungry; but if she be full,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>She spews out both, 
and makes their blessing null.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

were<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Worth

class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Let me add one word more. O man of God,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Art thou offended? 
Dost thou wish I had<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Put forth my matter in another dress?<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Or that I had in 
things been more express?<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Three things let me propound; then I submit<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>To those that are my 
betters, as is fit.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>1. I find not that I am denied the use<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Of this my method, 
so I no abuse<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Put on the words, things, readers, or be rude<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>In handling figure 
or similitude,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>In application; but all that I may<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Seek the advance of 
truth this or that way.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Denied, did I say? Nay, I have leave,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>(Example too, and 
that from them that have<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>God better pleased, by their words or ways,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Than any man that 
breatheth now-a-days,)<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>2. I find that men as high as trees will write<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Dialogue-wise; yet 
no man doth them slight<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>For writing so. Indeed, if they abuse<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Truth, cursed be 
they, and the craft they use<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>To that intent; but yet let truth be free<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>To make her sallies 
upon thee and me,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Which way it pleases God: for who knows how,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Better than he that 
taught us first to plough,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>To guide our minds and pens for his designs?<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And he makes base 
things usher in divine.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>3. I find that holy writ, in many places,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Hath semblance with 
this method, where the cases<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Do call for one thing to set forth another:<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Use it I may then, 
and yet nothing smother<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Truth’s golden beams: nay, by this method may<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Make it cast forth 
its rays as light as day.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And now, before I do put up my pen,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>I’ll show the profit 
of my book; and then<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Commit both thee and it unto that hand<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>That pulls the 
strong down, and makes weak ones stand.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>This book it chalketh out before thine eyes<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>The man that seeks 
the everlasting prize:<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>It shows you whence he comes, whither he goes,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>What he leaves 
undone; also what he does:<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>It also shows you how he runs, and runs,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Till he unto the 
gate of glory comes.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>It shows, too, who set out for life amain,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>As if the lasting 
crown they would obtain;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Here also you may see the reason why<SPAN

class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>This book will make a traveler of thee,<SPAN

thou wilt ruled be;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>It will direct thee to the Holy Land,<SPAN

directions understand<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Yea, it will make the slothful active be;<SPAN

class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>This book is writ in such a dialect<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>As may the minds of 
listless men affect:<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>It seems a novelty, and yet contains<SPAN

class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Would’st thou divert thyself from melancholy?<SPAN

pleasant, yet be far from folly?<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Would’st thou read riddles, and their 
explanation?<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Or 
else be drowned in thy contemplation?<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Dost thou love picking meat? Or would’st thou see<SPAN

again without a charm?<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

<H2 id=v.i-p0.1><A id=v.i-p0.2></A>THE FIRST STAGE</H2>
<P id=v.i-p1>As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a 
certain place where was a den,<A style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3" 
href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bunyan/pilgrim.doc?url=/ccel/bunyan/pilgrim.doc#_ftn3"

class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</SPAN><![endif]></SPAN></SPAN></A> and laid me 
down in that place to sleep; and as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, and 
behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his 
face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. 
<SCRIPREF id=v.i-p1.2 osisRef="Bible:Isa.64.6" parsed="|Isa|64|6|0|0"

parsed="|Ps|38|4|0|0" passage="Ps 38:4">Psalm 38:4</SCRIPREF>. I looked and saw 
him open the book, and read therein; and as he read, he wept and trembled; and 
not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, 
“What shall I do?” <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p1.5 osisRef="Bible:Acts.2.37"

passage="Hab 1:2,3">Habak 1:2,3</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.i-p2>In this plight, therefore, he went home, and restrained himself as 
long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive his distress; 
but he could not be silent long, because that his trouble increased. Wherefore 
at length he brake his mind to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk 
to them: “O, my dear wife,” said he, “and you the children of my bowels, I, your 
dear friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me; 
moreover, I am certainly informed that this our city will be burnt with fire 
from heaven; in which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife, and you 
my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) 
some way of escape can be found whereby we may be delivered.” At this his 
relations were sore amazed; not for that they believed that what he had said to 
them was true, but because they thought that some frenzy distemper had got into 
his head; therefore, it drawing towards night, and they hoping that sleep might 
settle his brains, with all haste they got him to bed. But the night was as 
troublesome to him as the day; wherefore, instead of sleeping, he spent it in 
sighs and tears. So when the morning was come, they would know how he did. He 
told them, “Worse and worse:” he also set to talking to them again; but they 
began to be hardened. They also thought to drive away his distemper by harsh and 
surly carriage to him; sometimes they would deride, sometimes they would chide, 
and sometimes they would quite neglect him. Wherefore he began to retire himself 
to his chamber to pray for and pity them, and also to condole his own misery; he 
would also walk solitarily in the fields, sometimes reading, and sometimes 
praying: and thus for some days he spent his time.</P>
<P id=v.i-p3>Now I saw, upon a time, when he was walking in the fields, that he 
was (as he was wont) reading in his book, and greatly distressed in his mind; 
and as he read, he burst out, as he had done before, crying, “What shall I do to 
be saved?” <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p3.1 osisRef="Bible:Acts.16.30 Bible:Acts.16.31" 
parsed="|Acts|16|30|0|0;|Acts|16|31|0|0" passage="Ac 16:30,31">Acts 
16:30,31</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.i-p4>I saw also that he looked this way, and that way, as if he would 
run; yet he stood still because (as I perceived) he could not tell which way to 
go. I looked then, and saw a man named Evangelist coming to him, and he asked, 
“Wherefore dost thou cry?”</P>
<P id=v.i-p5>He answered, “Sir, I perceive, by the book in my hand, that I am 
condemned to die, and after that to come to judgment, <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p5.1 
osisRef="Bible:Heb.9.27" parsed="|Heb|9|27|0|0" passage="Heb 9:27">Heb. 
9:27</SCRIPREF>; and I find that I am not willing to do the first, <SCRIPREF 
id=v.i-p5.2 osisRef="Bible:Job.10.21 Bible:Job.10.22" 
parsed="|Job|10|21|0|0;|Job|10|22|0|0" passage="Job 10:21,22">Job 10:

osisRef="Bible:Ezek.22.14" parsed="|Ezek|22|14|0|0" passage="Eze 22:14">Ezek. 
22:14</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.i-p6>Then said Evangelist, “Why not willing to die, since this life is 
attended with so many evils?” The man answered, “Because, I fear that this 
burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave, and I shall fall 
into Tophet. <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p6.1 osisRef="Bible:Isa.30.33" 
parsed="|Isa|30|33|0|0" passage="Isa 30:33">Isa. 30:33</SCRIPREF>. And Sir, if I 
be not fit to go to prison, I am not fit to go to judgment, and from thence to 
execution; and the thoughts of these things make me cry.”</P>
<P id=v.i-p7>Then said Evangelist, “If this be thy condition, why standest thou 
still?” He answered, “Because I know not whither to go.” Then he gave him a 
parchment roll, and there was written within, “Fly from the wrath to come.” 
<SCRIPREF id=v.i-p7.1 osisRef="Bible:Matt.3.7" parsed="|Matt|3|7|0|0" 
passage="Mt 3:7">Matt. 3:7</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.i-p8>The man therefore read it, and looking upon Evangelist very 
carefully, said, “Whither must I fly?” Then said Evangelist, (pointing with his 
finger over a very wide field,) “Do you see yonder wicket-gate?” <SCRIPREF 
id=v.i-p8.1 osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.13 Bible:Matt.7.14" 
parsed="|Matt|7|13|0|0;|Matt|7|14|0|0" passage="Mt 7:13,14">Matt.

shining light?” <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p8.2 osisRef="Bible:Ps.119.105"

Evangelist, “Keep that light in your eye, and go up directly thereto, so shalt 
thou see the gate; at which, when thou knockest, it shall be told thee what thou 
shalt do.” So I saw in my dream that the man began to run. Now he had not run 
far from his own door when his wife and children, perceiving it, began to cry 
after him to return; but the man put his fingers in his ears, and ran on crying, 
Life! life! eternal life! <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p8.4 osisRef="Bible:Luke.14.26" 
parsed="|Luke|14|26|0|0" passage="Lk 14:26">Luke 14:26</SCRIPREF>. So he looked

<P id=v.i-p9>The neighbors also came out to see him run, <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p9.1

<P id=v.i-p42>Now I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended this talk, they 
drew nigh to a very miry slough that was in the midst of the plain: and they 
being heedless, did both fall suddenly into the bog. The name of the slough was 
Despond. Here, therefore, they wallowed for a time, being grievously bedaubed 
with the dirt; and Christian, because of the burden that was on his back, began 
to sink in the mire.</P>

we expect between this and our journey’s end? May I get out again with my life, 
you shall possess the brave country alone for me. And with that he gave a 
desperate struggle or two, and got out of the mire on that side of the slough 
which was next to his own house: so away he went, and Christian saw him no 
more.</P>
<P id=v.i-p46>Wherefore Christian was left to tumble in the Slough of Despond 
alone; but still he endeavored to struggle to that side of the slough that was 
farthest from his own house, and next to the wicket-gate; the which he did, but 
could not get out because of the burden that was upon his back: but I beheld in

bid him go on his way.</P>
<P id=v.i-p51>Then I stepped to him that plucked him out, and said, “Sir, 
wherefore, since over this place is the way from the city of Destruction to 
yonder gate, is it, that this plat is not mended, that poor travellers might go 
thither with more security?” And he said unto me, “This miry slough is such a 
place as cannot be mended: it is the descent whither the scum and filth that 
attends conviction for sin doth continually run, and therefore it is called the 
Slough of Despond; for still, as the sinner is awakened about his lost 
condition, there arise in his soul many fears and doubts, and discouraging 
apprehensions, which all of them get together, and settle in this place: and 
this is the reason of the badness of this ground.</P>
<P id=v.i-p52>“It is not the pleasure of the King that this place should remain 
so bad. <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p52.1 osisRef="Bible:Isa.35.3 Bible:Isa.35.4"

he, “there have been swallowed up at least twenty thousand cart loads, yea, 
millions of wholesome instructions, that have at all seasons been brought from 
all places of the King’s dominions, (and they that can tell, say, they are the 
best materials to make good ground of the place,) if so be it might have been 
mended; but it is the Slough of Despond still, and so will be when they have 
done what they can.</P>
<P id=v.i-p53>“True, there are, by the direction of the Lawgiver, certain good 
and substantial steps, placed even through the very midst of this slough; but at 
such time as this place doth much spew out its filth, as it doth against change 
of weather, these steps are hardly seen; or if they be, men, through the 
dizziness of their heads, step beside, and then they are bemired to purpose, 
notwithstanding the steps be there: but the ground is good when they are once 
got in at the gate.” <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p53.1 osisRef="Bible:1Sam.12.23"

<P id=v.i-p54>Now I saw in my dream, that by this time Pliable was got home to 
his house. So his neighbors came to visit him; and some of them called him wise 
man for coming back, and some called him fool for hazarding himself with 
Christian: others again did mock at his cowardliness, saying, “Surely, since you 
began to venture, I would not have been so base as to have given out for a few 
difficulties:” so Pliable sat sneaking among them. But at last he got more 
confidence, and then they all turned their tales, and began to deride poor 
Christian behind his back. And thus much concerning Pliable.</P>
<P id=v.i-p55>Now as Christian was walking solitary by himself, he espied one 
afar off come crossing over the field to meet him; and their hap was to meet 
just as they were crossing the way of each other. The gentleman’s name that met 
him was Mr. Wordly Wiseman: he dwelt in the town of Carnal Policy, a very great

Christian, and having some inkling<A style="mso-footnote-id: ftn4"

ruled by his counsel. Thou hast met with something, as I perceive, already; for 
I see the dirt of the Slough of Despond is upon thee: but that slough is the 
beginning of the sorrows that do attend those that go on in that way. Hear me; I 
am older than thou: thou art like to meet with, in the way which thou goest, 
wearisomeness, painfulness, hunger, perils, nakedness, sword, lions, dragons, 
darkness, and, in a word, death, and what not. These things are certainly true, 
having been confirmed by many testimonies. And should a man so carelessly cast 
away himself, by giving heed to a stranger?</P>
<P id=v.i-p67><SPAN id=v.i-p67.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Why, sir, this burden on my 
back is more terrible to me than are all these things which you have mentioned: 
nay, methinks I care not what I meet with in the way, if so be I can also meet 
with deliverance from my burden.</P>
<P id=v.i-p68><SPAN id=v.i-p68.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. WORLDLY

<P id=v.i-p69><SPAN id=v.i-p69.1

<P id=v.i-p70><SPAN id=v.i-p70.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. WORLDLY 
WISEMAN:</SPAN> I thought so; and it has happened unto thee as to other weak 
men, who, meddling with things too high for them, do suddenly fall into thy 
distractions; which distractions do not only unman men, as thine I perceive have 
done thee, but they run them upon desperate ventures, to obtain they know not 
what.</P>
<P id=v.i-p71><SPAN id=v.i-p71.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> I know what I would obtain; 
it is ease from my heavy burden.</P>
<P id=v.i-p72><SPAN id=v.i-p72.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. WORLDLY

attend it? especially since (hadst thou but patience to hear me) I could direct 
thee to the obtaining of what thou desirest, without the dangers that thou in 
this way wilt run thyself into. Yea, and the remedy is at hand. Besides, I will

friendship, and content.</P>
<P id=v.i-p73><SPAN id=v.i-p73.1

to me.</P>
<P id=v.i-p74><SPAN id=v.i-p74.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. WORLDLY 
WISEMAN:</SPAN> Why, in yonder village (the village is named Morality) there 
dwells a gentleman whose name is Legality, a very judicious man, and a man of a 
very good name, that has skill to help men off with such burdens as thine is 
from their shoulders; yea to my knowledge, he hath done a great deal of good 
this way; aye, and besides, he hath skill to cure those that are somewhat crazed 
in their wits with their burdens. To him, as I said, thou mayest go, and be 
helped presently. His house is not quite a mile from this place; and if he 
should not be at home himself, he hath a pretty young man to his son, whose name 
is Civility, that can do it (to speak on) as well as the old gentleman himself: 
there, I say, thou mayest be eased of thy burden; and if thou art not minded to 
go back to thy former habitation, (as indeed I would not wish thee,) thou mayest 
send for thy wife and children to this village, where there are houses now 
standing empty, one of which thou mayest have at a reasonable rate: provision is 
there also cheap and good; and that which will make thy life the more happy is, 
to be sure there thou shalt live by honest neighbors, in credit and good 
fashion.</P>
<P id=v.i-p75>Now was Christian somewhat at a stand; but presently he concluded, 
If this be true which this gentleman hath said, my wisest course is to take his 
advice: and with that he thus farther spake.</P>
<P id=v.i-p76><SPAN id=v.i-p76.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Sir, which is my way to this 
honest man’s house?</P>
<P id=v.i-p77><SPAN id=v.i-p77.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. WORLDLY 
WISEMAN:</SPAN> Do you see yonder high hill?</P>
<P id=v.i-p78><SPAN id=v.i-p78.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Yes, very well.</P>
<P id=v.i-p79><SPAN id=v.i-p79.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. WORLDLY 
WISEMAN:</SPAN> By that hill you must go, and the first house you come at is 
his.</P>
<P id=v.i-p80>So Christian turned out of his way to go to Mr. Legality’s house 
for help: but, behold, when he was got now hard by the hill, it seemed so high, 
and also that side of it that was next the way-side did hang so much over, that 
Christian was afraid to venture further, lest the hill should fall on his head; 
wherefore there he stood still, and wotted not what to do. Also his burden now 
seemed heavier to him than while he was in his way. There came also flashes of 
fire, <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p80.1 osisRef="Bible:Exod.19.16" parsed="|Exod|19|16|0|0"

osisRef="Bible:Exod.19.18" parsed="|Exod|19|18|0|0"

that he should be burnt: here therefore he did sweat and quake for fear. 
<SCRIPREF id=v.i-p80.3 osisRef="Bible:Heb.12.21" parsed="|Heb|12|21|0|0" 
passage="Heb 12:21">Heb. 12:21</SCRIPREF>. And now he began to be sorry that he 
had taken Mr. Worldly Wiseman’s counsel; and with that he saw Evangelist coming 
to meet him, at the sight also of whom he began to blush for shame. So 
Evangelist drew nearer and nearer; and coming up to him, he looked upon him, 
with a severe and dreadful countenance, and thus began to reason with 
Christian.</P>
<P id=v.i-p81><SPAN id=v.i-p81.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> What doest thou here, 
Christian? said he: at which words Christian knew not what to answer; wherefore 
at present he stood speechless before him. Then said Evangelist farther, Art not 
thou the man that I found crying without the walls of the city of 
Destruction?</P>
<P id=v.i-p82><SPAN id=v.i-p82.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Yes, dear sir, I am the 
man.</P>
<P id=v.i-p83><SPAN id=v.i-p83.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> Did not I direct thee the 
way to the little wicket-gate?</P>
<P id=v.i-p84><SPAN id=v.i-p84.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Yes, dear sir, said 
Christian.</P>
<P id=v.i-p85><SPAN id=v.i-p85.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> How is it then thou art so 
quickly turned aside? For thou art now out of the way.</P>
<P id=v.i-p86><SPAN id=v.i-p86.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> I met with a gentleman so 
soon as I had got over the Slough of Despond, who persuaded me that I might, in 
the village before me, find a man that could take off my burden.</P>
<P id=v.i-p87><SPAN id=v.i-p87.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> What was he?</P>
<P id=v.i-p88><SPAN id=v.i-p88.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> He looked like a gentleman, 
and talked much to me, and got me at last to yield: so I came hither; but when I 
beheld this hill, and how it hangs over the way, I suddenly made a stand, lest 
it should fall on my head.</P>
<P id=v.i-p89><SPAN id=v.i-p89.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> What said that gentleman to 
you?</P>
<P id=v.i-p90><SPAN id=v.i-p90.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Why, he asked me whither I 
was going; and I told him.</P>
<P id=v.i-p91><SPAN id=v.i-p91.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> And what said he then?</P>
<P id=v.i-p92><SPAN id=v.i-p92.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> He asked me if I had a 
family; and I told him. But, said I, I am so laden with the burden that is on my 
back, that I cannot take pleasure in them as formerly.</P>
<P id=v.i-p93><SPAN id=v.i-p93.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> And what said he then?</P>
<P id=v.i-p94><SPAN id=v.i-p94.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> He bid me with speed get rid 
of my burden; and I told him it was ease that I sought. And, said I, I am 
therefore going to yonder gate, to receive farther direction how I may get to 
the place of deliverance. So he said that he would show me a better way, and 
short, not so attended with difficulties as the way, sir, that you set me in; 
which way, said he, will direct you to a gentleman’s house that hath skill to 
take off these burdens: so I believed him, and turned out of that way into this, 
if haply I might be soon eased of my burden. But when I came to this place, and 
beheld things as they are, I stopped, for fear (as I said) of danger: but I now 
know not what to do.</P>
<P id=v.i-p95><SPAN id=v.i-p95.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> Then said Evangelist, Stand 
still a little, that I show thee the words of God. So he stood trembling. Then 
said Evangelist, “See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh; for if they escaped 
not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we 
turn away from Him that speaketh from heaven.” <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p95.2 
osisRef="Bible:Heb.12.25" parsed="|Heb|12|25|0|0" passage="Heb 12:25">Heb.

any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.” <SCRIPREF

passage="Heb 10:38">Heb. 10:38</SCRIPREF>. He also did thus apply them: Thou art 
the man that art running into this misery; thou hast begun to reject the counsel 
of the Most High, and to draw back thy foot from the way of peace, even almost 
to the hazarding of thy perdition.</P>
<P id=v.i-p96>Then Christian fell down at his feet as dead, crying, Woe is me, 
for I am undone! At the sight of which Evangelist caught him by the right hand, 
saying, “All manner of sin and blasphemies shall be forgiven unto men.” 
<SCRIPREF id=v.i-p96.1 osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.31" parsed="|Matt|12|31|0|0"

passage="Jn 20:27">John 20:27</SCRIPREF>. Then did Christian again a little 
revive, and stood up trembling, as at first, before Evangelist.</P>
<P id=v.i-p97>Then Evangelist proceeded, saying, Give more earnest heed to the 
things that I shall tell thee of. I will now show thee who it was that deluded 
thee, and who it was also to whom he sent thee. The man that met thee is one 
Worldly Wiseman, and rightly is he so called; partly because he savoreth only 
the doctrine of this world, <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p97.1 osisRef="Bible:1John.4.5" 
parsed="|1John|4|5|0|0" passage="1 Jn 4:5">1 John 4:5</SCRIPREF>, (therefore he 
always goes to the town of Morality to church;) and partly because he loveth 
that doctrine best, for it saveth him best from the cross, <SCRIPREF 
id=v.i-p97.2 osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.12" parsed="|Gal|6|12|0|0" 
passage="Gal 6:12">Gal. 6:12</SCRIPREF>: and because he is of this carnal 
temper, therefore he seeketh to pervert my ways, though right. Now there are 
three things in this man’s counsel that thou must utterly abhor.</P>
<P id=v.i-p98>1. His turning thee out of the way.</P>
<P id=v.i-p99>2. His laboring to render the cross odious to thee.</P>
<P id=v.i-p100>3. And his setting thy feet in that way that leadeth unto the 
administration of death.</P>
<P id=v.i-p101>First, Thou must abhor his turning thee out of the way; yea, and 
thine own consenting thereto; because this is to reject the counsel of God for 
the sake of the counsel of a Worldly Wiseman. The Lord says, “Strive to enter in 
at the straight gate,” <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p101.1 osisRef="Bible:Luke.13.24" 
parsed="|Luke|13|24|0|0" passage="Lk 13:24">Luke 13:24</SCRIPREF>, the gate to 
which I send thee; “for strait is the gate that leadeth unto life, and few there 
be that find it.” <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p101.2 
osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.13 Bible:Matt.7.14" parsed="|Matt|7|13|0|0;|Matt|7|14|0|0" 
passage="Mt 7:13,14">Matt. 7:13,14</SCRIPREF>. From this little wicket-gate, and 
from the way thereto, hath this wicked man turned thee, to the bringing of thee 
almost to destruction: hate, therefore, his turning thee out of the way, and 
abhor thyself for hearkening to him.</P>
<P id=v.i-p102>Secondly, Thou must abhor his laboring to render the cross odious 
unto thee; for thou art to prefer it before the treasures of Egypt. <SCRIPREF 
id=v.i-p102.1 osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.25 Bible:Heb.11.26" 
parsed="|Heb|11|25|0|0;|Heb|11|26|0|0" passage="Heb 11:25,26">Heb.

will save his life shall lose it. And he that comes after him, and hates not his 
father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and 
his own life also, he cannot be his disciple. <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p102.2 
osisRef="Bible:Mark.8.38" parsed="|Mark|8|38|0|0" passage="Mk 8:38">Mark 
8:38</SCRIPREF>; <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p102.3 osisRef="Bible:John.12.25"

osisRef="Bible:Luke.14.26" parsed="|Luke|14|26|0|0" passage="Lk 14:26">Luke 
14:26</SCRIPREF>. I say, therefore, for a man to labor to persuade thee that 
that shall be thy death, without which, the truth hath said, thou canst not have 
eternal life, this doctrine thou must abhor.</P>
<P id=v.i-p103>Thirdly, Thou must hate his setting of thy feet in the way that 
leadeth to the ministration of death. And for this thou must consider to whom he 
sent thee, and also how unable that person was to deliver thee from thy 
burden.</P>
<P id=v.i-p104>He to whom thou wast sent for ease, being by name Legality, is 
the son of the bond-woman which now is, and is in bondage with her children, 
<SCRIPREF id=v.i-p104.1 osisRef="Bible:Gal.4.21-Gal.4.27" 
parsed="|Gal|4|21|4|27" passage="Gal 4:21-27">Gal. 4:21-27</SCRIPREF>, and is, 
in a mystery, this Mount Sinai, which thou hast feared will fall on thy head. 
Now if she with her children are in bondage, how canst thou expect by them to be 
made free? This Legality, therefore, is not able to set thee free from thy 
burden. No man was as yet ever rid of his burden by him; no, nor ever is like to 
be: ye cannot be justified by the works of the law; for by the deeds of the law 
no man living can be rid of his burden: Therefore Mr. Worldly Wiseman is an 
alien, and Mr. Legality is a cheat; and for his son Civility, notwithstanding 
his simpering looks, he is but a hypocrite, and cannot help thee. Believe me, 
there is nothing in all this noise that thou hast heard of these sottish men, 
but a design to beguile thee of thy salvation, by turning thee from the way in 
which I had set thee. After this, Evangelist called aloud to the heavens for 
confirmation of what he had said; and with that there came words and fire out of 
the mountain under which poor Christian stood, which made the hair of his flesh 
stand up. The words were pronounced: “As many as are of the works of the law, 
are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not 
in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.” <SCRIPREF 
id=v.i-p104.2 osisRef="Bible:Gal.3.10" parsed="|Gal|3|10|0|0" 
passage="Gal 3:10">Gal. 3:10</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.i-p105>Now Christian looked for nothing but death, and began to cry out 
lamentably; even cursing the time in which he met with Mr. Worldly Wiseman; 
still calling himself a thousand fools for hearkening to his counsel. He also 
was greatly ashamed to think that this gentleman’s arguments, flowing only from 
the flesh, should have the prevalency with him so far as to cause him to forsake 
the right way. This done, he applied himself again to Evangelist in words and 
sense as follows.</P>
<P id=v.i-p106><SPAN id=v.i-p106.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Sir, what think you? Is there 
any hope? May I now go back, and go up to the wicket-gate? Shall I not be 
abandoned for this, and sent back from thence ashamed? I am sorry I have 
hearkened to this man’s counsel; but may my sin be forgiven?</P>
<P id=v.i-p107><SPAN id=v.i-p107.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> Then said Evangelist to him, 
Thy sin is very great, for by it thou hast committed two evils: thou hast 
forsaken the way that is good, to tread in forbidden paths. Yet will the man at 
the gate receive thee, for he has good-will for men; only, said he, take heed 
that thou turn not aside again, lest thou “perish from the way, when his wrath 
is kindled but a little.” <SCRIPREF id=v.i-p107.2 osisRef="Bible:Ps.2.12" 
parsed="|Ps|2|12|0|0" passage="Ps 2:12">Psalm 2:12</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P class=div2>THE SECOND STAGE</P>
<H2 id=v.ii-p0.1><A id=v.ii-p0.2></A>THE SECOND STAGE</H2>
<P id=v.ii-p1>Then did Christian address himself to go back; and Evangelist, 
after he had kissed him, gave him one smile, and bid him God speed; So he went 
on with haste, neither spake he to any man by the way; nor if any asked him, 
would he vouchsafe them an answer. He went like one that was all the while 
treading on forbidden ground, and could by no means think himself safe, till 
again he was got into the way which he had left to follow Mr. Worldly Wiseman’s 
counsel. So, in process of time, Christian got up to the gate. Now, over the 
gate there was written, “Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” <SCRIPREF 
id=v.ii-p1.1 osisRef="Bible:Matt.7.7" parsed="|Matt|7|7|0|0" 
passage="Mt 7:7">Matt. 7:7</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p2>He knocked, therefore, more than once or twice, saying,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“May I now enter 
here? Will he within<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Open to sorry me, though I have been<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>An undeserving 
rebel? Then shall I<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Not fail to sing his lasting praise on high.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=v.ii-p3>At last there came a grave person to the gate, named Goodwill, who 
asked who was there, and whence he came, and what he would have.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p4><SPAN id=v.ii-p4.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Here is a poor burdened 
sinner. I come from the city of Destruction, but am going to Mount Zion, that I 
may be delivered from the wrath to come; I would therefore, sir, since I am 
informed that by this gate is the way thither, know if you are willing to let me 
in.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p5><SPAN id=v.ii-p5.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">GOODWILL:</SPAN> I am willing with all my 
heart, said he; and with that he opened the gate.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p6>So when Christian was stepping in, the other gave him a pull. Then 
said Christian, What means that? The other told him, A little distance from this 
gate there is erected a strong castle, of which Beelzebub is the captain: from 
thence both he and they that are with him, shoot arrows at those that come up to 
this gate, if haply they may die before they can enter in. Then said Christian, 
I rejoice and tremble. So when he was got in, the man of the Gate asked him who 
directed him thither.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p7><SPAN id=v.ii-p7.1

alone?</P>
<P id=v.ii-p11><SPAN id=v.ii-p11.1

<P id=v.ii-p14><SPAN id=v.ii-p14.1

<P id=v.ii-p16><SPAN id=v.ii-p16.1

Wherefore, getting out again on the side next to his own house, he told me I 
should possess the brave country alone for him: so he went his way, and I came

<P id=v.ii-p18><SPAN id=v.ii-p18.1

<P id=v.ii-p27>Then I saw in my dream, that Christian asked him further, if he 
could not help him off with his burden that was upon his back. For as yet he had 
not got rid thereof; nor could he by any means get it off without help.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p28>He told him, “As to thy burden, be content to bear it until thou 
comest to the place of deliverance; for there it will fall from thy back of

<P id=v.ii-p29>Then Christian began to gird up his loins, and to address himself 
to his journey. So the other told him, that by that he was gone some distance 
from the gate, he would come to the house of the Interpreter, at whose door he 
should knock, and he would show him excellent things. Then Christian took his

there.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p31><SPAN id=v.ii-p31.1

<P id=v.ii-p32>So he called for the master of the house, who, after a little

<P id=v.ii-p33><SPAN id=v.ii-p33.1

<P id=v.ii-p34><SPAN id=v.ii-p34.1

in; I will show thee that which will be profitable to thee. So he commanded his 
man to light the candle, and bid Christian follow him; so he had him into a 
private room, and bid his man open a door; the which when he had done, Christian 
saw the picture a very grave person hang up against the wall; and this was the 
fashion of it: It had eyes lifted up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, 
the law of truth was written upon its lips, the world was behind its back; it 
stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of gold did hang over its head.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p35><SPAN id=v.ii-p35.1

seest him with his eyes lift up to heaven, the best of books in his hand, and 
the law of truth writ on his lips: it is to show thee, that his work is to know, 
and unfold dark things to sinners; even as also thou seest him stand as if he 
pleaded with men. And whereas thou seest the world as cast behind him, and that 
a crown hangs over his head; that is to show thee, that slighting and despising 
the things that are present, for the love that he hath to his Master’s service, 
he is sure in the world that comes next, to have glory for his reward. Now, said 
the Interpreter, I have showed thee this picture first, because the man whose 
picture this is, is the only man whom the Lord of the place whither thou art 
going hath authorized to be thy guide in all difficult places thou mayest meet 
with in the way: wherefore take good heed to what I have showed thee, and bear 
well in thy mind what thou hast seen, lest in thy journey thou meet with some 
that pretend to lead thee right, but their way goes down to death.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p37>Then he took him by the hand, and led him into a very large 
parlor that was full of dust, because never swept; the which after he had 
reviewed it a little while, the Interpreter called for a man to sweep. Now, when 
he began to sweep, the dust began so abundantly to fly about, that Christian had 
almost therewith been choked. Then said the Interpreter to a damsel that stood 
by, “Bring hither water, and sprinkle the room;” the which when she had done, it 
was swept and cleansed with pleasure.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p38><SPAN id=v.ii-p38.1

<P id=v.ii-p39><SPAN id=v.ii-p39.1

This parlor is the heart of a man that was never sanctified by the sweet grace 
of the Gospel. The dust is his original sin, and inward corruptions, that have 
defiled the whole man. He that began to sweep at first, is the law; but she that 
brought water, and did sprinkle it, is the Gospel. Now whereas thou sawest, that 
so soon as the first began to sweep, the dust did so fly about that the room by 
him could not be cleansed, but that thou wast almost choked therewith; this is 
to show thee, that the law, instead of cleansing the heart (by its working) from 
sin, doth revive, <SCRIPREF id=v.ii-p39.2 osisRef="Bible:Rom.7.9"

for it doth not give power to subdue. Again, as thou sawest the damsel sprinkle 
the room with water, upon which it was cleansed with pleasure, this is to show 
thee, that when the Gospel comes in the sweet and precious influences thereof to 
the heart, then, I say, even as thou sawest the damsel lay the dust by 
sprinkling the floor with water, so is sin vanquished and subdued, and the soul 
made clean, through the faith of it, and consequently fit for the King of glory 
to inhabit. <SCRIPREF id=v.ii-p39.5 osisRef="Bible:John.15.3"

<P id=v.ii-p40>I saw moreover in my dream, that the Interpreter took him by the 
hand, and had him into a little room, where sat two little children, each one in 
his chair. The name of the eldest was Passion, and the name of the other 
Patience. Passion seemed to be much disconted, but Patience was very quiet. Then 
Christian asked, “What is the reason of the discontent of Passion?” The 
Interpreter answered, “The governor of them would have him stay for his best 
things till the beginning of the next year, but he will have all now; but 
Patience is willing to wait.”</P>
<P id=v.ii-p41>Then I saw that one came to Passion, and brought him a bag of 
treasure, and poured it down at his feet: the which he took up, and rejoiced 
therein, and withal laughed Patience to scorn. But I beheld but a while, and he 
had lavished all away, and had nothing left him but rags.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p42><SPAN id=v.ii-p42.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Then said Christian to the 
Interpreter, Expound this matter more fully to me.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p43><SPAN id=v.ii-p43.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">INTERPRETER:</SPAN> So he said, These two lads 
are figures; Passion of the men of this world, and Patience of the men of that 
which is to come; for, as here thou seest, passion will have all now, this year, 
that is to say, in this world; so are the men of this world: They must have all 
their good things now; they cannot stay till the next year, that is, until the 
next world, for their portion of good. That proverb, “A bird in the hand is 
worth two in the bush,” is of more authority with them than are all the divine 
testimonies of the good of the world to come. But as thou sawest that he had 
quickly lavished all away, and had presently left him nothing but rags, so will 
it be with all such men at the end of this world.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p44><SPAN id=v.ii-p44.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Then said Christian, Now I 
see that Patience has the best wisdom, and that upon many accounts. 1. Because 
he stays for the best things. 2. And also because he will have the glory of his, 
when the other has nothing but rags.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p45><SPAN id=v.ii-p45.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">INTERPRETER:</SPAN> Nay, you may add another, 
to wit, the glory of the next world will never wear out; but these are suddenly 
gone. Therefore Passion had not so much reason to laugh at Patience because he 
had his good things first, as Patience will have to laugh at Passion because he 
had his best things last; for first must give place to last, because last must 
have his time to come: but last gives place to nothing, for there is not another 
to succeed. He, therefore, that hath his portion first, must needs have a time 
to spend it; but he that hath his portion last, must have it lastingly: 
therefore it is said of Dives, “In thy lifetime thou receivedst thy good things, 
and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art 
tormented.” <SCRIPREF id=v.ii-p45.2 osisRef="Bible:Luke.16.25"

<P id=v.ii-p46><SPAN id=v.ii-p46.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Then I perceive it is not 
best to cover things that are now, but to wait for things to come.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p47><SPAN id=v.ii-p47.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">INTERPRETER:</SPAN> You say truth: for the

passage="2 Co 4:18">2 Cor. 4:18</SCRIPREF>. But though this be so, yet since 
things present and our fleshly appetite are such near neighbors one to another; 
and again, because things to come and carnal sense are such strangers one to 
another; therefore it is, that the first of these so suddenly fall into amity, 
and that distance is so continued between the second.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p48>Then I saw in my dream, that the Interpreter took Christian by 
the hand, and led him into a place where was a fire burning against a wall, and 
one standing by it, always casting much water upon it, to quench it; yet did the 
fire burn higher and hotter.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p49>Then said Christian, What means this?</P>
<P id=v.ii-p50>The Interpreter answered, This fire is the work of grace that is 
wrought in the heart; he that casts water upon it, to extinguish and put it out, 
is the devil: but in that thou seest the fire, notwithstanding, burn higher and 
hotter, thou shalt also see the reason of that. So he had him about to the back 
side of the wall, where he saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand, of the 
which he did also continually cast (but secretly) into the fire.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p51>Then said Christian, What means this?</P>
<P id=v.ii-p52>The Interpreter answered, This is Christ, who continually, with 
the oil of his grace, maintains the work already begun in the heart; by the 
means of which, notwithstanding what the devil can do, the souls of his people 
prove gracious still. <SCRIPREF id=v.ii-p52.1 osisRef="Bible:2Cor.12.9" 
parsed="|2Cor|12|9|0|0" passage="2 Co 12:9">2 Cor. 12:9</SCRIPREF>. And in that 
thou sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the fire; this is to 
teach thee, that it is hard for the tempted to see how this work of grace is 
maintained in the soul.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p53>I saw also, that the Interpreter took him again by the hand, and 
led him into a pleasant place, where was built a stately palace, beautiful to 
behold; at the sight of which Christian was greatly delighted. He saw also upon 
the top thereof certain persons walking, who were clothed all in gold.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p54>Then said Christian may we go in thither?</P>
<P id=v.ii-p55>Then the Interpreter took him, and led him up towards the door of 
the palace; and behold, at the door stood a great company of men, as desirous to 
go in, but durst not. There also sat a man at a little distance from the door, 
at a table-side, with a book and his inkhorn before him, to take the names of 
them that should enter therein; he saw also that in the doorway stood many men 
in armor to keep it, being resolved to do to the men that would enter, what hurt 
and mischief they could. Now was Christian somewhat in amaze. At last, when 
every man started back for fear of the armed men, Christian saw a man of a very 
stout countenance come up to the man that sat there to write, saying, “Set down 
my name, sir;” the which when he had done, he saw the man draw his sword, and 
put a helmet on his head, and rush towards the door upon the armed men, who laid 
upon him with deadly force; but the man, not at all discouraged, fell to cutting 
and hacking most fiercely. So after he had received and given many wounds to 
those that attempted to keep him out, <SCRIPREF id=v.ii-p55.1 
osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.12" parsed="|Matt|11|12|0|0" passage="Mt 11:12">Matt.

parsed="|Acts|14|22|0|0" passage="Ac 14:22 ">Acts 14:22</SCRIPREF>; he cut his 
way through them all, and pressed forward into the palace; at which there was a 
pleasant voice heard from those that were within, even of those that walked upon 
the top of the palace, saying,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

<P id=v.ii-p56>So he went in, and was clothed with such garments as they. Then 
Christian smiled, and said, I think verily I know the meaning of this.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p57>Now, said Christian, let me go hence. Nay, stay, said the 
Interpreter, till I have showed thee a little more, and after that thou shalt go 
on thy way. So he took him by the hand again, and led him into a very dark room, 
where there sat a man in an iron cage.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p58>Now the man, to look on, seemed very sad; he sat with his eyes 
looking down to the ground, his hands folded together, and he sighed as if he 
would break his heart. Then said Christian, What means this? At which the 
Interpreter bid him talk with the man.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p59>Then said Christian to the man, What art thou? The man answered, 
I am what I was not once.</P>

<P id=v.ii-p79>So he began, and said, “This night, as I was in my sleep, I 
dreamed, and behold the heavens grew exceeding black; also it thundered and 
lightened in most fearful wise, that it put me into an agony. So I looked up in 
my dream, and saw the clouds rack at an unusual rate; upon which I heard a great 
sound of a trumpet, and saw also a man sitting upon a cloud, attended with the 
thousands of heaven: they were all in flaming fire; also the heavens were in a 
burning flame. I heard then a voice, saying, ‘Arise, ye dead, and come to 
judgment.’ And with that the rocks rent, the graves opened, and the dead that 
were therein came forth: some of them were exceeding glad, and looked upward; 
and some sought to hide themselves under the mountains. Then I saw the man that 
sat upon the cloud open the book, and bid the world draw near. Yet there was, by

<P id=v.ii-p80><SPAN id=v.ii-p80.1

<P id=v.ii-p81><SPAN id=v.ii-p81.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">THE

and left me behind; also the pit of hell opened her mouth just where I stood. My 
conscience too afflicted me; and, as I thought, the Judge had always his eye 
upon me, showing indignation in his countenance.</P>
<P id=v.ii-p82>Then said the Interpreter to Christian, “Hast thou considered all

himself to his journey. Then said the Interpreter, “The Comforter be always with 
thee, good Christian, to guide thee in the way that leads to the city.” So 
Christian went on his way, saying,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

<P class=div2>THE THIRD STAGE</P>
<H2 id=v.iii-p0.1><A id=v.iii-p0.2></A>THE THIRD STAGE</H2>
<P id=v.iii-p1>Now I saw in my dream, that the highway up which Christian was to 
go, was fenced on either side with a wall, and that wall was called Salvation. 
<SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p1.1 osisRef="Bible:Isa.26.1" parsed="|Isa|26|1|0|0" 
passage="Isa 26:1">Isaiah 26:1</SCRIPREF>. Up this way, therefore, did burdened 
Christian run, but not without great difficulty, because of the load on his 
back.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p2>He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending; and upon 
that place stood a cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulchre. So I 
saw in my dream, that just as Christian came up with the cross, his burden 
loosed from off his shoulders, and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, 
and so continued to do till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell 
in, and I saw it no more.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p3>Then was Christian glad and lightsome, and said with a merry 
heart, “He hath given me rest by his sorrow, and life by his death.” Then he 
stood still a while, to look and wonder; for it was very surprising to him that 
the sight of the cross should thus ease him of his burden. He looked, therefore, 
and looked again, even till the springs that were in his head sent the waters 
down his cheeks. <SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p3.1 osisRef="Bible:Zech.12.10" 
parsed="|Zech|12|10|0|0" passage="Zec 12:10">Zech. 12:10</SCRIPREF>. Now as he 
stood looking and weeping, behold, three Shining Ones came to him, and saluted 
him with, “Peace be to thee.” So the first said to him, “Thy sins be forgiven 
thee,” <SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p3.2 osisRef="Bible:Mark.2.5" parsed="|Mark|2|5|0|0" 
passage="Mk 2:5">Mark 2:5</SCRIPREF>; the second stripped him of his rags, and 
clothed him with change of raiment, <SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p3.3 
osisRef="Bible:Zech.3.4" parsed="|Zech|3|4|0|0" passage="Zec 3:4">Zech.

id=v.iii-p3.4 osisRef="Bible:Eph.1.13" parsed="|Eph|1|13|0|0" 
passage="Eph 1:13">Eph. 1:13</SCRIPREF>, and gave him a roll with a seal upon 
it, which he bid him look on as he ran, and that he should give it in at the 
celestial gate: so they went their way. Then Christian gave three leaps for joy, 
and went on singing,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Thus far did I come laden with my sin,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Nor could aught ease 
the grief that I was in,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Till I came hither. What a place is this!<SPAN

was put to shame for me!”<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=v.iii-p4>I saw then in my dream, that he went on thus, even until he came 
at the bottom, where he saw, a little out of the way, three men fast asleep, 
with fetters upon their heels. The name of the one was Simple, of another Sloth, 
and of the third Presumption.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p5>Christian then seeing them lie in this case, went to them, if 
peradventure he might awake them, and cried, you are like them that sleep on the 
top of a mast, <SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p5.1 osisRef="Bible:Prov.23.34" 
parsed="|Prov|23|34|0|0" passage="Pr 23:34">Prov. 23:34</SCRIPREF>, for the Dead 
Sea is under you, a gulf that hath no bottom: awake, therefore, and come away; 
be willing also, and I will help you off with your irons. He also told them, If 
he that goeth about like a roaring lion, <SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p5.2 
osisRef="Bible:1Pet.5.8" parsed="|1Pet|5|8|0|0" passage="1 Pe 5:8">1 Pet. 
5:8</SCRIPREF>, comes by, you will certainly become a prey to his teeth. With 
that they looked upon him, and began to reply in this sort: Simple said, I see 
no danger; Sloth said, Yet a little more sleep; and Presumption said, Every tub 
must stand upon its own bottom. And so they lay down to sleep again, and 
Christian went on his way.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p6>Yet he was troubled to think that men in that danger should so 
little esteem the kindness of him that so freely offered to help them, both by 
awakening of them, counselling of them, and proffering to help them off with 
their irons. And as he was troubled thereabout, he espied two men come tumbling 
over the wall, on the left hand of the narrow way; and they made up apace to 
him. The name of the one was Formalist, and the name of the other Hypocrisy. So, 
as I said, they drew up unto him, who thus entered with them into discourse.</P>

if need were, testimony that would witness it for more than a thousand 
years.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p13><SPAN id=v.iii-p13.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> But, said Christian, will you 
stand a trial at law?</P>
<P id=v.iii-p14><SPAN id=v.iii-p14.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">FORMALIST 
AND HYPOCRISY:</SPAN> They told him, that custom, it being of so long standing 
as above a thousand years, would doubtless now be admitted as a thing legal by 
an impartial judge: and besides, said they, if we get into the way, what matter 
is it which way we get in? If we are in, we are in: thou art but in the way, 
who, as we perceive, came in at the gate; and we also are in the way, that came 
tumbling over the wall: wherein now is thy condition better than ours?</P>
<P id=v.iii-p15><SPAN id=v.iii-p15.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> I walk by the rule of my

already by the Lord of the way: therefore I doubt you will not be found true men 
at the end of the way. You come in by yourselves without his direction, and 
shall go out by yourselves without his mercy.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p16>To this they made him but little answer; only they bid him look 
to himself. Then I saw that they went on, every man in his way, without much 
conference one with another, save that these two men told Christian, that as to 
laws and ordinances, they doubted not but that they should as conscientiously do 
them as he. Therefore, said they, we see not wherein thou differest from us, but 
by the coat that is on thy back, which was, as we trow, given thee by some of 
thy neighbors, to hide the shame of thy nakedness.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p17><SPAN id=v.iii-p17.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> By laws and ordinances you 
will not be saved, since you came not in by the door. <SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p17.2 
osisRef="Bible:Gal.2.16" parsed="|Gal|2|16|0|0" passage="Gal 2:16">Gal. 
2:16</SCRIPREF>. And as for this coat that is on my back, it was given me by the 
Lord of the place whither I go; and that, as you say, to cover my nakedness 
with. And I take it as a token of kindness to me; for I had nothing but rags 
before. And besides, thus I comfort myself as I go. Surely, think I, when I come 
to the gate of the city, the Lord thereof will know me for good, since I have 
his coat on my back; a coat that he gave me freely in the day that he stripped 
me of my rags. I have, moreover, a mark in my forehead, of which perhaps you 
have taken no notice, which one of my Lord’s most intimate associates fixed 
there in the day that my burden fell off my shoulders. I will tell you, 
moreover, that I had then given me a roll sealed, to comfort me by reading as I 
go on the way; I was also bid to give it in at the celestial gate, in token of 
my certain going in after it: all which things I doubt you want, and want them 
because you came not in at the gate.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p18>To these things they gave him no answer; only they looked upon 
each other, and laughed. Then I saw that they went all on, save that Christian 
kept before, who had no more talk but with himself, and that sometimes 
sighingly, and sometimes comfortably: also he would be often reading in the roll 
that one of the Shining Ones gave him, by which he was refreshed.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p19>I beheld then, that they all went on till they came to the foot 
of the hill Difficulty, at the bottom of which there was a spring. There were 
also in the same place two other ways besides that which came straight from the 
gate: one turned to the left hand, and the other to the right, at the bottom of 
the hill; but the narrow way lay right up the hill, and the name of the going up 
the side of the hill is called Difficulty. Christian now went to the spring, 
<SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p19.1 osisRef="Bible:Isa.49.10" parsed="|Isa|49|10|0|0" 
passage="Isa 49:10">Isa. 49:10</SCRIPREF>, and drank thereof to refresh himself, 
and then began to go up the hill, saying,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“The hill, though 
high, I covet to ascend;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>The difficulty will not me offend;<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>For I perceive the 
way to life lies here:<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Come, pluck up heart, let’s neither faint nor 
fear.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Better, 
though <I>difficult</I>, the right way to go,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> 
<SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Than wrong, though <I>easy</I>, where the end is 
woe.”<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=v.iii-p20>The other two also came to the foot of the hill. But when they 
saw that the hill was steep and high, and that there were two other ways to go; 
and supposing also that these two ways might meet again with that up which 
Christian went, on the other side of the hill; therefore they were resolved to 
go in those ways. Now the name of one of those ways was Danger, and the name of 
the other Destruction. So the one took the way which is called Danger, which led 
him into a great wood; and the other took directly up the way to Destruction, 
which led him into a wide field, full of dark mountains, where he stumbled and 
fell, and rose no more.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p21>I looked then after Christian, to see him go up the hill, where 
I perceived he fell from running to going, and from going to clambering upon his 
hands and his knees, because of the steepness of the place. Now about the midway 
to the top of the hill was a pleasant Arbor, made by the Lord of the hill for 
the refreshment of weary travellers. Thither, therefore, Christian got, where 
also he sat down to rest him: then he pulled his roll out of his bosom, and read 
therein to his comfort; he also now began afresh to take a review of the coat or 
garment that was given to him as he stood by the cross. Thus pleasing himself 
awhile, he at last fell into a slumber, and thence into a fast sleep, which 
detained him in that place until it was almost night; and in his sleep his roll 
fell out of his hand. Now, as he was sleeping, there came one to him, and awaked 
him, saying, “Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.” 
<SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p21.1 osisRef="Bible:Prov.6.6" parsed="|Prov|6|6|0|0" 
passage="Pr 6:6">Prov. 6:6</SCRIPREF>. And with that, Christian suddenly started 
up, and sped him on his way, and went apace till he came to the top of the 
hill.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p22>Now when he was got up to the top of the hill, there came two 
men running amain; the name of the one was Timorous, and of the other Mistrust: 
to whom Christian said, Sirs, what’s the matter? you run the wrong way. Timorous 
answered, that they were going to the city of Zion, and had got up that 
difficult place: but, said he, the farther we go, the more danger we meet with; 
wherefore we turned, and are going back again.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p23>Yes, said Mistrust, for just before us lie a couple of lions in 
the way, whether sleeping or waking we know not; and we could not think, if we 
came within reach, but they would presently pull us in pieces.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p24><SPAN id=v.iii-p24.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Then said Christian, You make 
me afraid; but whither shall I fly to be safe? If I go back to mine own country, 
that is prepared for fire and brimstone, and I shall certainly perish there; if 
I can get to the celestial city, I am sure to be in safety there: I must 
venture. To go back is nothing but death: to go forward is fear of death, and 
life everlasting beyond it: I will yet go forward. So Mistrust and Timorous ran 
down the hill, and Christian went on his way. But thinking again of what he had 
heard from the men, he felt in his bosom for his roll, that he might read 
therein and be comforted; but he felt, and found it not. Then was Christian in 
great distress, and knew not what to do; for he wanted that which used to 
relieve him, and that which should have been his pass into the celestial city. 
Here, therefore, he began to be much perplexed, and knew not what to do. At last 
he bethought himself that he had slept in the arbor that is on the side of the 
hill; and falling down upon his knees, he asked God forgiveness for that foolish 
act, and then went back to look for his roll. But all the way he went back, who 
can sufficiently set forth the sorrow of Christian’s heart? Sometimes he sighed, 
sometimes he wept, and oftentimes he chid himself for being so foolish to fall 
asleep in that place, which was erected only for a little refreshment from his 
weariness. Thus, therefore, he went back, carefully looking on this side and on 
that, all the way as he went, if happily he might find his roll, that had been 
his comfort so many times in his journey. He went thus till he came again in 
sight of the arbor where he sat and slept; but that sight renewed his sorrow the 
more, by bringing again, even afresh, his evil of sleeping unto his mind. 
<SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p24.2 osisRef="Bible:Rev.2.4" parsed="|Rev|2|4|0|0"

osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.6-1Thess.5.8" parsed="|1Thess|5|6|5|8" 
passage="1 Th 5:6-8">1 Thess. 5:6-8</SCRIPREF>. Thus, therefore, he now went on, 
bewailing his sinful sleep, saying, O wretched man that I am, that I should 
sleep in the daytime! that I should sleep in the midst of difficulty! that I 
should so indulge the flesh as to use that rest for ease to my flesh which the 
Lord of the hill hath erected only for the relief of the spirits of pilgrims! 
How many steps have I taken in vain! Thus it happened to Israel; for their sin 
they were sent back again by the way of the Red Sea; and I am made to tread 
those steps with sorrow, which I might have trod with delight, had it not been 
for this sinful sleep. How far might I have been on my way by this time! I am 
made to tread those steps thrice over, which I needed not to have trod but once: 
yea, now also I am like to be benighted, for the day is almost spent. O that I 
had not slept!</P>
<P id=v.iii-p25>Now by this time he was come to the arbor again, where for a 
while he sat down and wept; but at last, (as Providence would have it,) looking 
sorrowfully down under the settle, there he espied his roll, the which he with 
trembling and haste catched up, and put it into his bosom. But who can tell how 
joyful this man was when he had gotten his roll again? For this roll was the 
assurance of his life, and acceptance at the desired haven. Therefore he laid it 
up in his bosom, gave thanks to God for directing his eye to the place where it 
lay, and with joy and tears betook himself again to his journey. But O how 
nimbly did he go up the rest of the hill! Yet before he got up, the sun went 
down upon Christian; and this made him again recall the vanity of his sleeping 
to his remembrance; and thus he again began to condole with himself: Oh thou 
sinful sleep! how for thy sake am I like to be benighted in my journey! I must 
walk without the sun, darkness must cover the path of my feet, and I must hear 
the noise of the doleful creatures, because of my sinful sleep! Now also he 
remembered the story that Mistrust and Timorous told him of, how they were 
frighted with the sight of the lions. Then said Christian to himself again, 
These beasts range in the night for their prey; and if they should meet with me 
in the dark, how should I shift them? how should I escape being by them torn in 
pieces? Thus he went on his way. But while he was bewailing his unhappy 
miscarriage, he lift up his eyes, and behold there was a very stately palace 
before him, the name of which was Beautiful, and it stood by the 
highway-side.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p26>So I saw in my dream that he made haste, and went forward, that 
if possible he might get lodging there. Now before he had gone far, he entered 
into a very narrow passage, which was about a furlong off the Porter’s lodge, 
and looking very narrowly before him as he went, he espied two lions in the way. 
Now, thought he, I see the dangers that Mistrust and Timorous were driven back 
by. (The lions were chained, but he saw not the chains.) Then he was afraid, and 
thought also himself to go back after them; for he thought nothing but death was 
before him. But the Porter at the lodge, whose name is Watchful, perceiving that 
Christian made a halt, as if he would go back, cried unto him, saying, Is thy 
strength so small? <SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p26.1 osisRef="Bible:Mark.4.40" 
parsed="|Mark|4|40|0|0" passage="Mk 4:40">Mark 4:40</SCRIPREF>. Fear not the 
lions, for they are chained, and are placed there for trial of faith where it 
is, and for discovery of those that have none: keep in the midst of the path, 
and no hurt shall come unto thee.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p27>Then I saw that he went on, trembling for fear of the lions, but 
taking good heed to the directions of the Porter; he heard them roar, but they 
did him no harm. Then he clapped his hands, and went on till he came and stood 
before the gate where the Porter was. Then said Christian to the Porter, Sir, 
what house is this? and may I lodge here to-night? The Porter answered, This 
house was built by the Lord of the hill, and he built it for the relief and 
security of pilgrims. The Porter also asked whence he was, and whither he was 
going.</P>

Nay, I had, notwithstanding that, been here much sooner, but that in my sleep I

for it, and not finding it, I was forced with sorrow of heart to go back to the

<P id=v.iii-p33><SPAN id=v.iii-p33.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">THE

came out of the door of the house a grave and beautiful damsel, named 
Discretion, and asked why she was called.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p34>The Porter answered, This man is on a journey from the city of 
Destruction to Mount Zion; but being weary and benighted, he asked me if he 
might lodge here to-night: so I told him I would call for thee, who, after 
discourse had with him, mayest do as seemeth thee good, even according to the 
law of the house.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p35>Then she asked him whence he was, and whither he was going; and 
he told her. She asked him also how he got into the way; and he told her. Then 
she asked him what he had seen and met with in the way, and he told her. And at 
last she asked his name. So he said, It is Christian; and I have so much the 
more a desire to lodge here to-night, because, by what I perceive, this place 
was built by the Lord of the hill for the relief and security of pilgrims. So 
she smiled, but the water stood in her eyes; and after a little pause she said, 
I will call forth two or three more of the family. So she ran to the door, and 
called out Prudence, Piety, and Charity, who, after a little more discourse with 
him, had him into the family; and many of them meeting him at the threshold of 
the house, said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; this house was built by the 
Lord of the hill on purpose to entertain such pilgrims in. Then he bowed his 
head, and followed them into the house. So when he was come in and sat down, 
they gave him something to drink, and consented together that, until supper was 
ready, some of them should have some particular discourse with Christian, for 
the best improvement of time; and they appointed Piety, Prudence, and Charity to 
discourse with him: and thus they began.</P>

there, the remembrance of which will stick by me as long as I live, especially 
three things: to wit, how Christ, in despite of Satan, maintains his work of 
grace in the heart; how the man had sinned himself quite out of hopes of God’s 
mercy; and also the dream of him that thought in his sleep the day of judgment 
was come.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p44><SPAN id=v.iii-p44.1

<P id=v.iii-p46><SPAN id=v.iii-p46.1

<P id=v.iii-p47><SPAN id=v.iii-p47.1

where he showed me a stately palace, and how the people were clad in gold that 
were in it; and how there came a venturous man, and cut his way through the 
armed men that stood in the door to keep him out; and how he was bid to come in, 
and win eternal glory. Methought those things did ravish my heart. I would have 
stayed at that good man’s house a twelvemonth, but that I knew I had farther to 
go.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p48><SPAN id=v.iii-p48.1

farther, and I saw One, as I thought in my mind, hang bleeding upon a tree; and 
the very sight of him made my burden fall off my back; for I groaned under a 
very heavy burden, but then it fell down from off me. It was a strange thing to 
me, for I never saw such a thing before: yea, and while I stood looking up, (for 
then I could not forbear looking,) three Shining Ones came to me. One of them 
testified that my sins were forgiven me; another stripped me of my rags, and 
gave me this broidered coat which you see; and the third set the mark which you 
see in my forehead, and gave me this sealed roll, (and with that he plucked it 
out of his bosom.)</P>
<P id=v.iii-p50><SPAN id=v.iii-p50.1

you were the best: yet some other I saw, as, namely, I saw three men, Simple, 
Sloth, and Presumption, lie asleep, a little out of the way, as I came, with 
irons upon their heels; but do you think I could awake them? I also saw 
Formality and Hypocrisy come tumbling over the wall, to go, as they pretended, 
to Zion; but they were quickly lost, even as I myself did tell them, but they 
would not believe. But, above all, I found it hard work to get up this hill, and 
as hard to come by the lions’ mouths; and, truly, if it had not been for the 
good man, the porter that stands at the gate, I do not know but that, after all, 
I might have gone back again; but I thank God I am here, and thank you for 
receiving me.</P>

going on pilgrimage. Yea, for this very thing, they would tell me I was too 
precise, and that I denied myself of things (for their sakes) in which they saw 
no evil. Nay, I think I may say, that if what they saw in me did hinder them, it

all their talk at the table was about the Lord of the hill; as, namely, about 
what he had done, and wherefore he did what he did, and why he had builded that

had fought with and slain him that had the power of death, <SCRIPREF

<P id=v.iii-p79>For, as they said, and as I believe, said Christian, he did it 
with the loss of much blood. But that which put the glory of grace into all he 
did, was, that he did it out of pure love to his country. And besides, there 
were some of them of the household that said they had been and spoke with him 
since he did die on the cross; and they have attested that they had it from his 
own lips, that he is such a lover of poor pilgrims, that the like is not to be 
found from the east to the west. They, moreover, gave an instance of what they 
affirmed; and that was, he had stripped himself of his glory that he might do 
this for the poor; and that they heard him say and affirm, that he would not 
dwell in the mountain of Zion alone. They said, moreover, that he had made many 
pilgrims princes, though by nature they were beggars born, and their original 
had been the dunghill. <SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p79.1 osisRef="Bible:1Sam.2.8"

<P id=v.iii-p80>Thus they discoursed together till late at night; and after they 
had committed themselves to their Lord for protection, they betook themselves to 
rest. The pilgrim they laid in a large upper chamber, whose window opened 
towards the sun-rising. The name of the chamber was Peace, where he slept till 
break of day, and then he awoke and sang,</P><SPAN

<P id=v.iii-p81>So in the morning they all got up; and, after some more 
discourse, they told him that he should not depart till they had shown him the 
rarities of that place. And first they had him into the study, where they showed 
him records of the greatest antiquity; in which, as I remember my dream, they 
showed him the pedigree of the Lord of the hill, that he was the Son of the 
Ancient of days, and came by eternal generation. Here also was more fully 
recorded the acts that he had done, and the names of many hundreds that he had 
taken into his service; and how he had placed them in such habitations that 
could neither by length of days, nor decays of nature, be dissolved.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p82>Then they read to him some of the worthy acts that some of his 
servants had done; as how they had subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, 
obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, 
escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant 
in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the aliens. <SCRIPREF

<P id=v.iii-p83>Then they read again another part of the records of the house, 
where it was shown how willing their Lord was to receive into his favor any, 
even any, though they in time past had offered great affronts to his person and 
proceedings. Here also were several other histories of many other famous things, 
of all which Christian had a view; as of things both ancient and modern, 
together with prophecies and predictions of things that have their certain 
accomplishment, both to the dread and amazement of enemies, and the comfort and 
solace of pilgrims.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p84>The next day they took him, and had him into the armory, where 
they showed him all manner of furniture which their Lord had provided for 
pilgrims, as sword, shield, helmet, breastplate, all-prayer, and shoes that 
would not wear out. And there was here enough of this to harness out as many men 
for the service of their Lord as there be stars in the heaven for multitude.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p85>They also showed him some of the engines with which some of his 
servants had done wonderful things. They showed him Moses’ rod; the hammer and 
nail with which Jael slew Sisera; the pitchers, trumpets, and lamps too, with 
which Gideon put to flight the armies of Midian. Then they showed him the 
ox-goad wherewith Shamgar slew six hundred men. They showed him also the jawbone 
with which Samson did such mighty feats. They showed him moreover the sling and 
stone with which David slew Goliath of Gath; and the sword also with which their 
Lord will kill the man of sin, in the day that he shall rise up to the prey. 
They showed him besides many excellent things, with which Christian was much 
delighted. This done, they went to their rest again.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p86>Then I saw in my dream, that on the morrow he got up to go 
forward, but they desired him to stay till the next day also; and then, said 
they, we will, if the day be clear, show you the Delectable Mountains; which, 
they said, would yet farther add to his comfort, because they were nearer the 
desired haven than the place where at present he was; so he consented and 
stayed. When the morning was up, they had him to the top of the house, and bid 
him look south. So he did, and behold, at a great distance, he saw a most 
pleasant mountainous country, beautified with woods, vineyards, fruits of all 
sorts, flowers also, with springs and fountains, very delectable to behold. 
<SCRIPREF id=v.iii-p86.1 osisRef="Bible:Isa.33.16 Bible:Isa.33.17"

Immanuel’s land; and it is as common, said they, as this hill is, to and for all 
the pilgrims. And when thou comest there, from thence thou mayest see to the 
gate of the celestial city, as the shepherds that live there will make 
appear.</P>
<P id=v.iii-p87>Now he bethought himself of setting forward, and they were 
willing he should. But first, said they, let us go again into the armory. So 
they did; and when he came there, they harnessed him from head to foot with what 
was of proof, lest perhaps he should meet with assaults in the way. He being 
therefore thus accoutred, walked out with his friends to the gate; and there he 
asked the Porter if he saw any pilgrim pass by. Then the Porter answered, 
Yes.</P>

<P class=div2>THE FOURTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=v.iv-p0.1><A id=v.iv-p0.2></A>THE FOURTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=v.iv-p1>Then he began to go forward; but Discretion, Piety, Charity, and 
Prudence would accompany him down to the foot of the hill. So they went on 
together, reiterating their former discourses, till they came to go down the 
hill. Then said Christian, As it was difficult coming up, so, so far as I can 
see, it is dangerous going down. Yes, said Prudence, so it is; for it is a hard 
matter for a man to go down into the valley of Humiliation, as thou art now, and 
to catch no slip by the way; therefore, said they, we are come out to accompany 
thee down the hill. So he began to go down, but very warily; yet he caught a 
slip or two.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p2>Then I saw in my dream, that these good companions, when Christian 
was got down to the bottom of the hill, gave him a loaf of bread, a bottle of 
wine, and a cluster of raisins; and then he went on his way,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Whilst Christian 
is among his godly friends,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Their golden mouths make him sufficient mends<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>For all his griefs; 
and when they let him go,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>He’s clad with northern steel from top to toe.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=v.iv-p3>But now, in this valley of Humiliation, poor Christian was hard 
put to it; for he had gone but a little way before he espied a foul fiend coming 
over the field to meet him: his name is Apollyon. Then did Christian begin to be 
afraid, and to cast in his mind whether to go back, or to stand his ground. But 
he considered again, that he had no armor for his back, and therefore thought 
that to turn the back to him might give him greater advantage with ease to 
pierce him with his darts; therefore he resolved to venture and stand his 
ground: for, thought he, had I no more in mine eye than the saving of my life, 
it would be the best way to stand.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p4>So he went on, and Apollyon met him. Now the monster was hideous 
to behold: he was clothed with scales like a fish, and they are his pride; he 
had wings like a dragon, and feet like a bear, and out of his belly came fire 
and smoke; and his mouth was as the mouth of a lion. When he was come up to 
Christian, he beheld him with a disdainful countenance, and thus began to 
question him.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p5><SPAN id=v.iv-p5.1

compliance with thee. And besides, O thou destroying Apollyon, to speak truth, I 
like his service, his wages, his servants, his government, his company, and 
country, better than thine; therefore leave off to persuade me farther: I am his 
servant, and I will follow him.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p15><SPAN id=v.iv-p15.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">APOLLYON:</SPAN> Consider again, when thou art 
in cool blood, what thou art like to meet with in the way that thou goest. Thou 
knowest that for the most part his servants come to an ill end, because they are 
transgressors against me and my ways. How many of them have been put to shameful 
deaths! And besides, thou countest his service better than mine; whereas he 
never yet came from the place where he is, to deliver any that served him out of 
their enemies’ hands: but as for me, how many times, as all the world very well 
knows, have I delivered, either by power or fraud, those that have faithfully 
served me, from him and his, though taken by them! And so will I deliver 
thee.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p16><SPAN id=v.iv-p16.1

deliver them, is on purpose to try their love, whether they will cleave to him

glorious in their account. For, for present deliverance, they do not much expect 
it; for they stay for their glory; and then they shall have it, when their 
Prince comes in his and the glory of the angels.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p17><SPAN id=v.iv-p17.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">APOLLYON:</SPAN> Thou hast already been

him?</P>
<P id=v.iv-p18><SPAN id=v.iv-p18.1

been unfaithful to him?</P>
<P id=v.iv-p19><SPAN id=v.iv-p19.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">APOLLYON:</SPAN> Thou didst faint at first 
setting out, when thou wast almost choked in the gulf of Despond. Thou didst 
attempt wrong ways to be rid of thy burden, whereas thou shouldst have stayed 
till thy Prince had taken it off. Thou didst sinfully sleep, and lose thy choice 
things. Thou wast almost persuaded also to go back at the sight of the lions. 
And when thou talkest of thy journey, and of what thou hast seen and heard, thou 
art inwardly desirous of vainglory in all that thou sayest or doest.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p20><SPAN id=v.iv-p20.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> All this is true, and much 
more which thou hast left out; but the Prince whom I serve and honor is 
merciful, and ready to forgive. But besides, these infirmities possessed me in 
thy country, for there I sucked them in, and I have groaned under them, been 
sorry for them, and have obtained pardon of my Prince.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p21><SPAN id=v.iv-p21.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">APOLLYON:</SPAN> Then Apollyon broke out into a 
grievous rage, saying, I am an enemy to this Prince; I hate his person, his 
laws, and people: I am come out on purpose to withstand thee.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p22><SPAN id=v.iv-p22.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Apollyon, beware what you do, 
for I am in the King’s highway, the way of holiness; therefore take heed to 
yourself.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p23><SPAN id=v.iv-p23.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">APOLLYON:</SPAN> Then Apollyon straddled quite 
over the whole breadth of the way, and said, I am void of fear in this matter. 
Prepare thyself to die; for I swear by my infernal den, that thou shalt go no 
farther: here will I spill thy soul. And with that he threw a flaming dart at 
his breast; but Christian had a shield in his hand, with which he caught it, and 
so prevented the danger of that.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p24>Then did Christian draw, for he saw it was time to bestir him; 
and Apollyon as fast made at him, throwing darts as thick as hail; by the which, 
notwithstanding all that Christian could do to avoid it, Apollyon wounded him in 
his head, his hand, and foot. This made Christian give a little back: Apollyon, 
therefore, followed his work amain, and Christian again took courage, and 
resisted as manfully as he could. This sore combat lasted for above half a day, 
even till Christian was almost quite spent: for you must know, that Christian, 
by reason of his wounds, must needs grow weaker and weaker.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p25>Then Apollyon, espying his opportunity, began to gather up close 
to Christian, and wrestling with him, gave him a dreadful fall; and with that 
Christian’s sword flew out of his hand. Then said Apollyon, I am sure of thee 
now: and with that he had almost pressed him to death, so that Christian began 
to despair of life. But, as God would have it, while Apollyon was fetching his 
last blow, thereby to make a full end of this good man, Christian nimbly reached 
out his hand for his sword, and caught it, saying, Rejoice not against me, O 
mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise, <SCRIPREF id=v.iv-p25.1 
osisRef="Bible:Mic.7.8" parsed="|Mic|7|8|0|0" passage="Mic 7:8">Mic. 
7:8</SCRIPREF>; and with that gave him a deadly thrust, which made him give 
back, as one that had received his mortal wound. Christian perceiving that, made 
at him again, saying, Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, 
through Him that loved us. <SCRIPREF id=v.iv-p25.2 osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.37" 
parsed="|Rom|8|37|0|0" passage="Rom 8:37">Rom. 8:37</SCRIPREF>. And with that 
Apollyon spread forth his dragon wings, and sped him away, that Christian saw 
him no more. <SCRIPREF id=v.iv-p25.3 osisRef="Bible:Jas.4.7" 
parsed="|Jas|4|7|0|0" passage="Jas 4:7">James 4:7</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p26>In this combat no man can imagine, unless he had seen and heard, 
as I did, what yelling and hideous roaring Apollyon made all the time of the 
fight; he spake like a dragon: and on the other side, what sighs and groans 
burst from Christian’s heart. I never saw him all the while give so much as one 
pleasant look, till he perceived he had wounded Apollyon with his two-edged 
sword; then, indeed, he did smile, and look upward! But it was the dreadfullest 
sight that ever I saw.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p27>So when the battle was over, Christian said, I will here give 
thanks to him that hath delivered me out of the mouth of the lion, to him that 
did help me against Apollyon. And so he did, saying,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Great Beelzebub, 
the captain of this fiend,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Designed my ruin; therefore to this end<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>He sent him 
harness’d out; and he, with rage<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>That hellish was, did fiercely me engage:<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>But blessed Michael 
helped me, and I,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>By dint of sword, did quickly make him fly:<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Therefore to Him let 
me give lasting praise,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And thank and bless his holy name always.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=v.iv-p28>Then there came to him a hand with some of the leaves of the tree 
of life, the which Christian took and applied to the wounds that he had received 
in the battle, and was healed immediately. He also sat down in that place to eat 
bread, and to drink of the bottle that was given him a little before: so, being 
refreshed, he addressed himself to his journey with his sword drawn in his hand; 
for he said, I know not but some other enemy may be at hand. But he met with no 
other affront from Apollyon quite through this valley.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p29>Now at the end of this valley was another, called the Valley of 
the Shadow of Death; and Christian must needs go through it, because the way to 
the Celestial City lay through the midst of it. Now, this valley is a very 
solitary place. The prophet Jeremiah thus describes it: “A wilderness, a land of 
deserts and pits, a land of drought, and of the Shadow of Death, a land that no 
man” (but a Christian) “passeth through, and where no man dwelt.” <SCRIPREF

<P id=v.iv-p30>Now here Christian was worse put to it than in his fight with 
Apollyon, as by the sequel you shall see.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p31>I saw then in my dream, that when Christian was got to the

valley a continual howling and yelling, as of a people under unutterable misery,

<P id=v.iv-p42>So they parted, and Christian went on his way, but still with his 
sword drawn in his hand, for fear lest he should be assaulted.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p43>I saw then in my dream, so far as this valley reached, there was 
on the right hand a very deep ditch; that ditch is it into which the blind have 
led the blind in all ages, and have both there miserably perished. Again, 
behold, on the left hand there was a very dangerous quag, into which, if even a 
good man falls, he finds no bottom for his foot to stand on: into that quag king 
David once did fall, and had no doubt therein been smothered, had not He that is 
able plucked him out. <SCRIPREF id=v.iv-p43.1 osisRef="Bible:Ps.69.14" 
parsed="|Ps|69|14|0|0" passage="Ps 69:14">Psa. 69:14</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p44>The pathway was here also exceeding narrow, and therefore good 
Christian was the more put to it; for when he sought, in the dark, to shun the 
ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tip over into the mire on the other; 
also, when he sought to escape the mire, without great carefulness he would be 
ready to fall into the ditch. Thus he went on, and I heard him here sigh 
bitterly; for besides the danger mentioned above, the pathway was here so dark, 
that ofttimes when he lifted up his foot to go forward, he knew not where, or 
upon what he should set it next.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p45>About the midst of this valley I perceived the mouth of hell to 
be, and it stood also hard by the wayside. Now, thought Christian, what shall I 
do? And ever and anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance, with 
sparks and hideous noises, (things that cared not for Christian’s sword, as did 
Apollyon before,) that he was forced to put up his sword, and betake himself to 
another weapon, called All-prayer, <SCRIPREF id=v.iv-p45.1 
osisRef="Bible:Eph.6.18" parsed="|Eph|6|18|0|0" passage="Eph 6:18">Eph.

soul. <SCRIPREF id=v.iv-p45.2 osisRef="Bible:Ps.116.4" parsed="|Ps|116|4|0|0" 
passage="Ps 116:4">Psa. 116:4</SCRIPREF>. Thus he went on a great while, yet 
still the flames would be reaching towards him; also he heard doleful voices, 
and rushings to and fro, so that sometimes he thought he should be torn in 
pieces, or trodden down like mire in the streets. This frightful sight was seen, 
and these dreadful noises were heard by him for several miles together; and 
coming to a place where he thought he heard a company of fiends coming forward 
to meet him, he stopped, and began to muse what he had best to do. Sometimes he 
had half a thought to go back; then again he thought he might be half-way 
through the valley. He remembered also, how he had already vanquished many a 
danger; and that the danger of going back might be much more than for to go 
forward. So he resolved to go on; yet the fiends seemed to come nearer and 
nearer. But when they were come even almost at him, he cried out with a most 
vehement voice, I will walk in the strength of the Lord God. So they gave back, 
and came no farther.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p46>One thing I would not let slip. I took notice that now poor 
Christian was so confounded that he did not know his own voice; and thus I 
perceived it. Just when he was come over against the mouth of the burning pit, 
one of the wicked ones got behind him, and stepped up softly to him, and 
whisperingly suggested many grievous blasphemies to him, which he verily thought 
had proceeded from his own mind. This put Christian more to it than any thing 
that he met with before, even to think that he should now blaspheme Him that he 
loved so much before. Yet if he could have helped it, he would not have done it; 
but he had not the discretion either to stop his ears, or to know from whence 
these blasphemies came.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p47>When Christian had travelled in this disconsolate condition some 
considerable time, he thought he heard the voice of a man, as going before him, 
saying, Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no 
evil, for thou art with me. <SCRIPREF id=v.iv-p47.1 osisRef="Bible:Ps.23.4" 
parsed="|Ps|23|4|0|0" passage="Ps 23:4">Psa. 23:4</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p48>Then was he glad, and that for these reasons:</P>
<P id=v.iv-p49>First, Because he gathered from thence, that some who feared God 
were in this valley as well as himself.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p50>Secondly, For that he perceived God was with them, though in that 
dark and dismal state. And why not, thought he, with me? though by reason of the 
impediment that attends this place, I cannot perceive it. <SCRIPREF 
id=v.iv-p50.1 osisRef="Bible:Job.9.11" parsed="|Job|9|11|0|0" 
passage="Job 9:11">Job 9:11</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p51>Thirdly, For that he hoped (could he overtake them) to have 
company by and by.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p52>So he went on, and called to him that was before; but he knew not 
what to answer, for that he also thought himself to be alone. And by and by the 
day broke: then said Christian, “He hath turned the shadow of death into the 
morning.” <SCRIPREF id=v.iv-p52.1 osisRef="Bible:Amos.5.8" 
parsed="|Amos|5|8|0|0" passage="Am 5:8">Amos 5:8</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p53>Now morning being come, he looked back, not out of desire to 
return, but to see, by the light of the day, what hazards he had gone through in 
the dark. So he saw more perfectly the ditch that was on the one hand, and the 
quag that was on the other; also how narrow the way was which led betwixt them 
both. Also now he saw the hobgoblins, and satyrs, and dragons of the pit, but 
all afar off; for after break of day they came not nigh; yet they were 
discovered to him, according to that which is written, “He discovereth deep 
things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.” 
<SCRIPREF id=v.iv-p53.1 osisRef="Bible:Job.12.22" parsed="|Job|12|22|0|0" 
passage="Job 12:22">Job 12:22</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p54>Now was Christian much affected with this deliverance from all 
the dangers of his solitary way; which dangers, though he feared them much 
before, yet he saw them more clearly now, because the light of the day made them 
conspicuous to him. And about this time the sun was rising, and this was another 
mercy to Christian; for you must note, that though the first part of the Valley 
of the Shadow of Death was dangerous, yet this second part, which he was yet to 
go, was, if possible, far more dangerous; for, from the place where he now 
stood, even to the end of the valley, the way was all along set so full of 
snares, traps, gins, and nets here, and so full of pits, pitfalls, deep holes, 
and shelvings-down there, that had it now been dark, as it was when he came the 
first part of the way, had he had a thousand souls, they had in reason been cast 
away; but, as I said, just now the sun was rising. Then said he, “His Candle 
shineth on my head, and by his light I go through darkness.” <SCRIPREF 
id=v.iv-p54.1 osisRef="Bible:Job.29.3" parsed="|Job|29|3|0|0" 
passage="Job 29:3">Job 29:3</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p55>In this light, therefore, he came to the end of the valley. Now I 
saw in my dream, that at the end of the valley lay blood, bones, ashes, and 
mangled bodies of men, even of pilgrims that had gone this way formerly; and 
while I was musing what should be the reason, I espied a little before me a 
cave, where two giants, Pope and Pagan, dwelt in old times; by whose power and 
tyranny the men whose bones, blood, ashes, etc., lay there, were cruelly put to 
death. But by this place Christian went without much danger, whereat I somewhat 
wondered; but I have learnt since, that Pagan has been dead many a day; and as 
for the other, though he be yet alive, he is, by reason of age, and also of the 
many shrewd brushes that he met with in his younger days, grown so crazy and 
stiff in his joints that he can now do little more than sit in his cave’s mouth, 
grinning at pilgrims as they go by, and biting his nails because he cannot come 
at them.</P>
<P id=v.iv-p56>So I saw that Christian went on his way; yet, at the sight of the 
old man that sat at the mouth of the cave, he could not tell what to think, 
especially because he spoke to him, though he could not go after him, saying, 
You will never mend, till more of you be burned. But he held his peace, and set 
a good face on it; and so went by, and catched no hurt. Then sang 
Christian,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“O world of wonders, (I can say no less,)<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>That I should be 
preserved in that distress<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>That I have met with here! O blessed be<SPAN

<P class=div2>THE FIFTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=v.v-p0.1><A id=v.v-p0.2></A>THE FIFTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=v.v-p1>Now, as Christian went on his way, he came to a little ascent, 
which was cast up on purpose that pilgrims might see before them: up there, 
therefore, Christian went; and looking forward, he saw Faithful before him upon 
his journey: Then said Christian aloud, Ho, ho; so-ho; stay, and I will be your 
companion. At that Faithful looked behind him; to whom Christian cried again, 
Stay, stay, till I come up to you. But Faithful answered, No, I am upon my life, 
and the avenger of blood is behind me.</P>
<P id=v.v-p2>At this Christian was somewhat moved, and putting to all his 
strength, he quickly got up with Faithful, and did also overrun him; so the last 
was first. Then did Christian vaingloriously smile, because he had gotten the 
start of his brother; but not taking good heed to his feet, he suddenly stumbled 
and fell, and could not rise again until Faithful came up to help him.</P>
<P id=v.v-p3>Then I saw in my dream, they went very lovingly on together, and 
had sweet discourse of all things that had happened to them in their pilgrimage; 
and thus Christian began.</P>
<P id=v.v-p4><SPAN id=v.v-p4.1

Till I could stay no longer; for there was a great talk presently after you were

down to the ground.</P>
<P id=v.v-p8><SPAN id=v.v-p8.1

great talk thereabout, yet I do not think they did firmly believe it; for, in 
the heat of the discourse, I heard some of them deridingly speak of you and of 
your desperate journey, for so they called this your pilgrimage. But I did 
believe, and do still, that the end of our city will be with fire and brimstone 
from above; and therefore I have made my escape.</P>
<P id=v.v-p12><SPAN id=v.v-p12.1

he followed you till he came to the Slough of Despond, where, as some said, he 
fell in; but he would not be known to have so done: but I am sure he was soundly 
bedabbled with that kind of dirt.</P>
<P id=v.v-p14><SPAN id=v.v-p14.1

to dwell with me for the wages that I shall give thee? Then I asked his name,

I further asked him, what house he kept, and what other servants he had. So he 
told me that his house was maintained with all the dainties of the world, and 
that his servants were those of his own begetting. Then I asked how many 
children he had. He said that he had but three daughters, the Lust of the Flesh,

he would send such a one after me that should make my way bitter to my soul. So 
I turned to go away from him; but just as I turned myself to go thence, I felt

these that he named, might claim a kindred of me, and that rightly, (for indeed 
they were my relations according to the flesh,) yet since I became a pilgrim 
they have disowned me, and I also have rejected them; and therefore they were to 
me now no more than if they had never been of my lineage. I told him, moreover, 
that as to this valley, he had quite misrepresented the thing; for before honor 
is humility, and a haughty spirit before a fall. Therefore, said I, I had rather 
go through this valley to the honor that was so accounted by the wisest, than 
choose that which he esteemed most worthy of our affections.</P>

for a man to watch over his words and ways, so as to tie up himself from that 
hectoring liberty that the brave spirits of the times accustomed themselves 
unto, would make him the ridicule of the times. He objected also, that but few 
of the mighty, rich, or wise, were ever of my opinion; nor any of them neither, 
before they were persuaded to be fools, and to be of a voluntary fondness to 
venture the loss of all for nobody knows what. <SCRIPREF id=v.v-p54.2

those that were chiefly the pilgrims of the times in which they lived; also 
their ignorance and want of understanding in all natural science. Yea, he did 
hold me to it at that rate also, about a great many more things than here I 
relate; as, that it was a shame to sit whining and mourning under a sermon, and 
a shame to come sighing and groaning home; that it was a shame to ask my 
neighbor forgiveness for petty faults, or to make restitution where I have taken 
from any. He said also, that religion made a man grow strange to the great, 
because of a few vices, which he called by finer names, and made him own and 
respect the base, because of the same religious fraternity: And is not this, 
said he, a shame?</P>

again, this Shame tells me what men are; but he tells me nothing what God, or 
the word of God is. And I thought, moreover, that at the day of doom we shall 
not be doomed to death or life according to the hectoring spirits of the world, 
but according to the wisdom and law of the Highest. Therefore, thought I, what 
God says is best, is indeed best, though all the men in the world are against 
it. Seeing, then, that God prefers his religion; seeing God prefers a tender 
Conscience; seeing they that make themselves fools for the kingdom of heaven are 
wisest, and that the poor man that loveth Christ is richer than the greatest man 
in the world that hates him; Shame, depart, thou art an enemy to my salvation.

or other of the infirmities that attend religion. But at last I told him, that 
it was but in vain to attempt farther in this business; for those things that he 
disdained, in those did I see most glory: and so at last I got past this

For instance, if a man doth delight to talk of the history, or the mystery of

necessity of the new birth, the insufficiency of our works, the need of Christ’s 
righteousness, etc. Besides, by this a man may learn what it is to repent, to 
believe, to pray, to suffer, or the like: by this, also, a man may learn what 
are the great promises and consolations of the Gospel, to his own comfort.

and the more drink he hath in his crown, the more of these things he hath in his

of faith, and of the new birth; but he knows but only to talk of them. I have 
been in his family, and have observed him both at home and abroad; and I know 
what I say of him is the truth. His house is as empty of religion as the white 
of an egg is of savor. There is there neither prayer, nor sign of repentance for 
sin; yea, the brute, in his kind, serves God far better than he. He is the very

abroad, and a devil at home.” His poor family finds it so; he is such a churl, 
such a railer at, and so unreasonable with his servants, that they neither know 
how to do for or speak to him. Men that have any dealings with him say, It is 
better to deal with a Turk than with him, for fairer dealings they shall have at 
their hands. This Talkative (if it be possible) will go beyond them, defraud, 
beguile, and overreach them. Besides, he brings up his sons to follow his steps; 
and if he finds in any of them a foolish timorousness, (for so he calls the 
first appearance of a tender conscience,) he calls them fools and blockheads, 
and by no means will employ them in much, or speak to their commendation before 
others. For my part, I am of opinion that he has, by his wicked life, caused 
many to stumble and fall; and will be, if God prevents not, the ruin of many 
more.</P>

upon good men’s names and professions. But all these things, yea, and a great

he thinks that hearing and saying will make a good Christian; and thus he 
deceiveth his own soul. Hearing is but as the sowing of the seed; talking is not

of man?</P>
<P id=v.v-p106><SPAN id=v.v-p106.1

shall be willing to answer you. And take my answer in brief, thus: First, where 
the grace of God is in the heart, it causeth there a great outcry against sin. 
Secondly-</P>
<P id=v.v-p107><SPAN id=v.v-p107.1

<P id=v.v-p108><SPAN id=v.v-p108.1

<P id=v.v-p109><SPAN id=v.v-p109.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">FAITHFUL:</SPAN> Oh! a great deal. A man may 
cry out against sin, of policy; but he cannot abhor it but by virtue of a godly 
antipathy against it. I have heard many cry out against sin in the pulpit, who 
yet can abide it well enough in the heart, house, and conversation. <SCRIPREF

loud voice, as if she had been very holy; but she would willingly, 
notwithstanding that, have committed uncleanness with him. Some cry out against 
sin, even as the mother cries out against her child in her lap, when she calleth 
it slut and naughty girl, and then falls to hugging and kissing it.</P>

first: but, first or last, it is also false; for knowledge, great knowledge, may 
be obtained in the mysteries of the Gospel, and yet no work of grace in the 
soul. Yea, if a man have all knowledge, he may yet be nothing, and so, 
consequently, be no child of God. <SCRIPREF id=v.v-p113.2 
osisRef="Bible:1Cor.13.2" parsed="|1Cor|13|2|0|0" passage="1 Co 13:2">1 Cor. 
13:2</SCRIPREF>. When Christ said, “Do you know all these things?” and the 
disciples answered, Yes, he added, “Blessed are ye if ye do them.” He doth not 
lay the blessing in the knowing of them, but in the doing of them. For there is 
a knowledge that is not attended with doing: “He that knoweth his Master’s will, 
and doeth it not.” A man may know like an angel, and yet be no Christian: 
therefore your sign of it is not true. Indeed, to <I>know</I> is a thing that 
pleaseth talkers and boasters; but to <I>do</I> is that which pleaseth God. Not 
that the heart can be good without knowledge, for without that the heart is 
naught. There are, therefore, two sorts of knowledge, knowledge that resteth in 
the bare speculation of things, and knowledge that is accompanied with the grace 
of faith and love, which puts a man upon doing even the will of God from the 
heart: the first of these will serve the talker; but without the other, the true 
Christian is not content. “Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, 
I shall observe it with my whole heart.” <SCRIPREF id=v.v-p113.3

family-holiness, (if he hath a family,) and by conversation-holiness in the 
world; which in the general teacheth him inwardly to abhor his sin, and himself 
for that, in secret; to suppress it in his family, and to promote holiness in 
the world: not by talk only, as a hypocrite or talkative person may do, but by a 
practical subjection in faith and love to the power of the word. <SCRIPREF

description of the work of grace, and also the discovery of it, if you have 
aught to object, object; if not, then give me leave to propound to you a second 
question.</P>
<P id=v.v-p123><SPAN id=v.v-p123.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TALKATIVE:</SPAN> Nay, my part is not now to 
object, but to hear; let me, therefore, have your second question.</P>
<P id=v.v-p124><SPAN id=v.v-p124.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">FAITHFUL:</SPAN> It is this: Do you experience 
this first part of the description of it; and doth your life and conversation 
testify the same? Or standeth your religion in word or tongue, and not in deed 
and truth? Pray, if you incline to answer me in this, say no more than you know 
the God above will say Amen to, and also nothing but what your conscience can 
justify you in; for not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the 
Lord commendeth. Besides, to say I am thus and thus, when my conversation, and 
all my neighbors, tell me I lie, is great wickedness.</P>
<P id=v.v-p125>Then Talkative at first began to blush; but, recovering himself, 
thus he replied: You come now to experience, to conscience, and to God; and to 
appeal to him for justification of what is spoken. This kind of discourse I did 
not expect; nor am I disposed to give an answer to such questions, because I 
count not myself bound thereto, unless you take upon you to be a catechiser; and 
though you should so do, yet I may refuse to make you my judge. But I pray, will 
you tell me why you ask me such questions?</P>
<P id=v.v-p126><SPAN id=v.v-p126.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">FAITHFUL:</SPAN> Because I saw you forward to 
talk, and because I knew not that you had aught else but notion. Besides, to 
tell you all the truth, I have heard of you that you are a man whose religion 
lies in talk, and that your conversation gives this your mouth-profession the 
lie. They say you are a spot among Christians, and that religion fareth the 
worse for your ungodly conversation; that some have already stumbled at your 
wicked ways, and that more are in danger of being destroyed thereby: your 
religion, and an ale-house, and covetousness, and uncleanness, and swearing, and 
lying, and vain company-keeping, etc., will stand together. The proverb is true 
of you which is said of a harlot, to wit, “That she is a shame to all women:” so 
are you a shame to all professors.</P>
<P id=v.v-p127><SPAN id=v.v-p127.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TALKATIVE:</SPAN> Since you are so ready to 
take up reports, and to judge so rashly as you do, I cannot but conclude you are 
some peevish or melancholy man, not fit to be discoursed with; and so adieu.</P>
<P id=v.v-p128>Then up came Christian, and said to his brother, I told you how 
it would happen; your words and his lusts could not agree. He had rather leave 
your company than reform his life. But he is gone, as I said: let him go; the 
loss is no man’s but his own. He has saved us the trouble of going from him; for 
he continuing (as I suppose he will do) as he is, would have been but a blot in 
our company: besides, the apostle says, “From such withdraw thyself.”</P>
<P id=v.v-p129><SPAN id=v.v-p129.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">FAITHFUL:</SPAN> But I am glad we had this 
little discourse with him; it may happen that he will think of it again: 
however, I have dealt plainly with him, and so am clear of his blood if he 
perisheth.</P>
<P id=v.v-p130><SPAN id=v.v-p130.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> You did well to talk so 
plainly to him as you did. There is but little of this faithful dealing with men 
now-a-days, and that makes religion to stink so in the nostrils of many as it 
doth; for they are these talkative fools, whose religion is only in word, and 
who are debauched and vain in their conversation, that (being so much admitted 
into the fellowship of the godly) do puzzle the world, blemish Christianity, and 
grieve the sincere. I wish that all men would deal with such as you have done; 
then should they either be made more conformable to religion, or the company of 
saints would be too hot for them. Then did Faithful say,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“How Talkative at 
first lifts up his plumes!<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>How bravely doth he speak! How he presumes<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>To drive down all 
before him! But so soon<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>As Faithful talks of heart-work, like the moon<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>That’s past the 
full, into the wane he goes;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And so will all but he that heart-work know.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=v.v-p131>Thus they went on, talking of what they had seen by the way, and 
so made that way easy, which would otherwise no doubt have been tedious to them, 
for now they went through a wilderness.</P>
<P class=div2>THE SIXTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=v.vi-p0.1><A id=v.vi-p0.2></A>THE SIXTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=v.vi-p1>Now when they were got almost quite out of this wilderness, 
Faithful chanced to cast his eye back, and espied one coming after them, and he 
knew him. Oh! said Faithful to his brother, who comes yonder? Then Christian 
looked, and said, It is my good friend Evangelist. Aye, and my good friend too, 
said Faithful, for ‘twas he that set me on the way to the gate. Now was 
Evangelist come up unto them, and thus saluted them.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p2><SPAN id=v.vi-p2.1

<P id=v.vi-p3><SPAN id=v.vi-p3.1

<P id=v.vi-p4><SPAN id=v.vi-p4.1

<P id=v.vi-p5><SPAN id=v.vi-p5.1

hath it fared with you, my friends, since the time of our last parting? What 
have you met with, and how have you behaved yourselves?</P>
<P id=v.vi-p6>Then Christian and Faithful told him of all things that had 
happened to them in the way; and how, and with what difficulty, they had arrived 
to that place.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p7>Right glad am I, said Evangelist, not that you have met with 
trials, but that you have been victors, and for that you have, notwithstanding 
many weaknesses, continued in the way to this very day.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p8>I say, right glad am I of this thing, and that for mine own sake 
and yours: I have sowed, and you have reaped; and the day is coming, when “both 
he that soweth, and they that reap, shall rejoice together,” <SCRIPREF 
id=v.vi-p8.1 osisRef="Bible:John.4.36" parsed="|John|4|36|0|0"

osisRef="Bible:Gal.6.9" parsed="|Gal|6|9|0|0" passage="Gal 6:9">Gal.

this crown, and after they have gone far for it, another comes in and takes it 
from them: “hold fast, therefore, that you have; let no man take your crown.” 
<SCRIPREF id=v.vi-p8.4 osisRef="Bible:Rev.3.11" parsed="|Rev|3|11|0|0" 
passage="Rev 3:11">Rev. 3:11</SCRIPREF>. You are not yet out of the gunshot of 
the devil; “you have not resisted unto blood, striving against sin.” Let the 
kingdom be always before you, and believe steadfastly concerning the things that 
are invisible. Let nothing that is on this side the other world get within you. 
And, above all, look well to your own hearts and to the lusts thereof; for they 
are “deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.” Set your faces like a 
flint; you have all power in heaven and earth on your side.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p9><SPAN id=v.vi-p9.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Then Christian thanked him 
for his exhortations; but told him withal, that they would have him speak 
farther to them for their help the rest of the way; and the rather, for that 
they well knew that he was a prophet, and could tell them of things that might 
happen unto them, and also how they might resist and overcome them. To which 
request Faithful also consented. So Evangelist began as followeth.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p10><SPAN id=v.vi-p10.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EVANGELIST:</SPAN> My sons, you have heard in 
the word of the truth of the Gospel, that you must “through many tribulations 
enter into the kingdom of heaven;” and again, that “in every city, bonds and 
afflictions abide you;” and therefore you cannot expect that you should go long 
on your pilgrimage without them, in some sort or other. You have found something 
of the truth of these testimonies upon you already, and more will immediately 
follow: for now, as you see, you are almost out of this wilderness, and 
therefore you will soon come into a town that you will by and by see before you; 
and in that town you will be hardly beset with enemies, who will strain hard but 
they will kill you; and be you sure that one or both of you must seal the 
testimony which you hold, with blood; but “be you faithful unto death, and the 
King will give you a crown of life.” He that shall die there, although his death 
will be unnatural, and his pain, perhaps, great, he will yet have the better of 
his fellow; not only because he will be arrived at the Celestial City soonest, 
but because he will escape many miseries that the other will meet with in the 
rest of his journey. But when you are come to the town, and shall find fulfilled 
what I have here related, then remember your friend, and quit yourselves like 
men, and “commit the keeping of your souls to God in well doing, as unto a 
faithful Creator.”</P>
<P id=v.vi-p11>Then I saw in my dream, that when they were got out of the 
wilderness, they presently saw a town before them, and the name of that town is 
Vanity; and at the town there is a fair kept, called Vanity Fair. It is kept all 
the year long. It beareth the name of Vanity Fair, because the town where it is 
kept is lighter than vanity, <SCRIPREF id=v.vi-p11.1 osisRef="Bible:Ps.62.9"

<P id=v.vi-p12>This fair is no new-erected business but a thing of ancient

<P id=v.vi-p13>Almost five thousand years ago there were pilgrims walking to the 
Celestial City, as these two honest persons are: and Beelzebub, Apollyon, and 
Legion, with their companions, perceiving by the path that the pilgrims made, 
that their way to the city lay through this town of Vanity, they contrived here 
to set up a fair; a fair wherein should be sold all sorts of vanity, and that it 
should last all the year long. Therefore, at this fair are all such merchandise 
sold as houses, lands, trades, places, honors, preferments, titles, countries, 
kingdoms, lusts, pleasures; and delights of all sorts, as harlots, wives, 
husbands, children, masters, servants, lives, blood, bodies, souls, silver, 
gold, pearls, precious stones, and what not.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p14>And moreover, at this fair there is at all times to be seen 
jugglings, cheats, games, plays, fools, apes, knaves, and rogues, and that of 
every kind.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p15>Here are to be seen, too, and that for nothing, thefts, murders, 
adulteries, false-swearers, and that of a blood-red color.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p16>And, as in other fairs of less moment, there are the several rows 
and streets under their proper names, where such and such wares are vended; so 
here, likewise, you have the proper places, rows, streets, (namely, countries 
and kingdoms,) where the wares of this fair are soonest to be found. Here is the 
Britain Row, the French Row, the Italian Row, the Spanish Row, the German Row, 
where several sorts of vanities are to be sold. But, as in other fairs, some one 
commodity is as the chief of all the fair; so the ware of Rome and her 
merchandise is greatly promoted in this fair; only our English nation, with some 
others, have taken a dislike thereat.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p17>Now, as I said, the way to the Celestial City lies just through 
this town, where this lusty fair is kept; and he that will go to the city, and 
yet not go through this town, “must needs go out of the world.” <SCRIPREF

passage="1 Co 4:10">1 Cor. 4:10</SCRIPREF>. The Prince of princes himself, when 
here, went through this town to his own country, and that upon a fair-day too; 
yea, and, as I think, it was Beelzebub, the chief lord of this fair, that 
invited him to buy of his vanities, yea, would have made him lord of the fair, 
would he but have done him reverence as he went through the town. Yea, because 
he was such a person of honor, Beelzebub had him from street to street, and 
showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a little time, that he might, if 
possible, allure that blessed One to cheapen and buy some of his vanities; but 
he had no mind to the merchandise, and therefore left the town, without laying 
out so much as one farthing upon these vanities. <SCRIPREF id=v.vi-p17.2

and a very great fair.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p18>Now, these pilgrims, as I said, must needs go through this fair. 
Well, so they did; but behold, even as they entered into the fair, all the 
people in the fair were moved; and the town itself, as it were, in a hubbub 
about them, and that for several reasons: for,</P>
<P id=v.vi-p19>First, The Pilgrims were clothed with such kind of raiment as was 
diverse from the raiment of any that traded in that fair. The people, therefore, 
of the fair made a great gazing upon them: some said they were fools; <SCRIPREF 
id=v.vi-p19.1 osisRef="Bible:1Cor.4.9 Bible:1Cor.4.10" 
parsed="|1Cor|4|9|0|0;|1Cor|4|10|0|0" passage="1 Co 4:9,10">1 Cor. 
4:9,10</SCRIPREF>; some, they were bedlams; and some, they were outlandish 
men.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p20>Secondly, And as they wondered at their apparel, so they did 
likewise at their speech; for few could understand what they said. They 
naturally spoke the language of Canaan; but they that kept the fair were the men 
of this world: so that from one end of the fair to the other, they seemed 
barbarians each to the other. <SCRIPREF id=v.vi-p20.1 
osisRef="Bible:1Cor.2.7 Bible:1Cor.2.8" parsed="|1Cor|2|7|0|0;|1Cor|2|8|0|0" 
passage="1 Co 2:7,8">1 Cor. 2:7,8</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p21>Thirdly, But that which did not a little amuse the merchandisers 
was, that these pilgrims set very light by all their wares. They cared not so 
much as to look upon them; and if they called upon them to buy, they would put 
their fingers in their ears, and cry, “Turn away mine eyes from beholding 
vanity,” <SCRIPREF id=v.vi-p21.1 osisRef="Bible:Ps.119.37" 
parsed="|Ps|119|37|0|0" passage="Ps 119:37">Psa. 119:37</SCRIPREF>, and look 
upward, signifying that their trade and traffic was in heaven. <SCRIPREF

parsed="|Phil|3|20|0|0;|Phil|3|21|0|0" passage="Php 3:20,21">Phil. 3: 
20,21</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p22>One chanced, mockingly, beholding the carriage of the men, to say 
unto them, “What will ye buy?” But they, looking gravely upon him, said, “We buy 
the truth.” <SCRIPREF id=v.vi-p22.1 osisRef="Bible:Prov.23.23" 
parsed="|Prov|23|23|0|0" passage="Pr 23:23">Prov. 23:23</SCRIPREF>. At that 
there was an occasion taken to despise the men the more; some mocking, some 
taunting, some speaking reproachfully, and some calling upon others to smite 
them. At last, things came to an hubbub and great stir in the fair, insomuch 
that all order was confounded. Now was word presently brought to the great one 
of the fair, who quickly came down, and deputed some of his most trusty friends 
to take those men into examination about whom the fair was almost overturned. So 
the men were brought to examination; and they that sat upon them asked them 
whence they came, whither they went, and what they did there in such an unusual 
garb. The men told them they were pilgrims and strangers in the world, and that 
they were going to their own country, which was the heavenly Jerusalem, 
<SCRIPREF id=v.vi-p22.2 osisRef="Bible:Heb.11.13-Heb.11.16" 
parsed="|Heb|11|13|11|16" passage="Heb 11:13-16">Heb. 11:13-16</SCRIPREF>; and 
that they had given no occasion to the men of the town, nor yet to the 
merchandisrs, thus to abuse them, and to let them in their journey, except it 
was for that, when one asked them what they would buy, they said they would buy 
the truth. But they that were appointed to examine them did not believe them to 
be any other than bedlams and mad, or else such as came to put all things into a 
confusion in the fair. Therefore they took them and beat them, and besmeared 
them with dirt, and then put them into the cage, that they might be made a 
spectacle to all the men of the fair. There, therefore, they lay for some time, 
and were made the objects of any man’s sport, or malice, or revenge; the great 
one of the fair laughing still at all that befell them. But the men being 
patient, and “not rendering railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing,” and 
giving good words for bad, and kindness for injuries done, some men in the fair, 
that were more observing and less prejudiced than the rest, began to check and 
blame the baser sort for their continual abuses done by them to the men. They, 
therefore, in an angry manner let fly at them again, counting them as bad as the 
men in the cage, and telling them that they seemed confederates, and should be 
made partakers of their misfortunes. The others replied that, for aught they 
could see, the men were quiet and sober, and intended nobody any harm; and that 
there were many that traded in their fair that were more worthy to be put into 
the cage, yea, and pillory too, than were the men that they had abused. Thus, 
after divers words had passed on both sides, (the men behaving themselves all 
the while very wisely and soberly before them,) they fell to some blows among 
themselves, and did harm one to another. Then were these two poor men brought 
before their examiners again, and were charged as being guilty of the late 
hubbub that had been in the fair. So they beat them pitifully, and hanged irons 
upon them, and led them in chains up and down the fair, for an example and 
terror to others, lest any should speak in their behalf, or join themselves unto 
them. But Christian and Faithful behaved themselves yet more wisely, and 
received the ignominy and shame that was cast upon them with so much meekness 
and patience, that it won to their side (though but few in comparison of the 
rest) several of the men in the fair. This put the other party yet into a 
greater rage, insomuch that they concluded the death of these two men. Wherefore 
they threatened that neither cage nor irons should serve their turn, but that 
they should die for the abuse they had done, and for deluding the men of the 
fair.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p23>Then were they remanded to the cage again, until further order 
should be taken with them. So they put them in, and made their feet fast in the 
stocks.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p24>Here, also, they called again to mind what they had heard from 
their faithful friend Evangelist, and were the more confirmed in their way and 
sufferings by what he told them would happen to them. They also now comforted 
each other, that whose lot it was to suffer, even he should have the best of it: 
therefore each man secretly wished that he might have that preferment. But 
committing themselves to the all-wise disposal of Him that ruleth all things, 
with much content they abode in the condition in which they were, until they 
should be otherwise disposed of.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p25>Then a convenient time being appointed, they brought them forth 
to their trial, in order to their condemnation. When the time was come, they 
were brought before their enemies and arraigned. The judge’s name was Lord 
Hate-good; their indictment was one and the same in substance, though somewhat 
varying in form; the contents whereof was this: “That they were enemies to, and 
disturbers of, the trade; that they had made commotions and divisions in the 
town, and had won a party to their own most dangerous opinions, in contempt of 
the law of their prince.”</P>
<P id=v.vi-p26>Then Faithful began to answer, that he had only set himself 
against that which had set itself against Him that is higher than the highest. 
And, said he, as for disturbance, I make none, being myself a man of peace: the 
parties that were won to us, were won by beholding our truth and innocence, and 
they are only turned from the worse to the better. And as to the king you talk 
of, since he is Beelzebub, the enemy of our Lord, I defy him and all his 
angels.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p27>Then proclamation was made, that they that had ought to say for 
their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar, should forthwith appear, 
and give in their evidence. So there came in three witnesses, to wit, Envy, 
Superstition, and Pickthank. They were then asked if they knew the prisoner at 
the bar; and what they had to say for their lord the king against him.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p28>Then stood forth Envy, and said to this effect: My lord, I have 
known this man a long time, and will attest upon my oath before this honorable 
bench, that he is-</P>
<P id=v.vi-p29><SPAN id=v.vi-p29.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">JUDGE:</SPAN> Hold; give him his oath.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p30>So they sware him. Then he said, My lord, this man, 
notwithstanding his plausible name, is one of the vilest men in our country; he 
neither regardeth prince nor people, law nor custom, but doeth all that he can 
to possess all men with certain of his disloyal notions, which he in the general 
calls principles of faith and holiness. And in particular, I heard him once 
myself affirm, that Christianity and the customs of our town of Vanity were 
diametrically opposite, and could not be reconciled. By which saying, my lord, 
he doth at once not only condemn all our laudable doings, but us in the doing of 
them.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p31>Then did the judge say to him, Hast thou any more to say?</P>
<P id=v.vi-p32><SPAN id=v.vi-p32.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">ENVY:</SPAN> 
My lord, I could say much more, only I would not be tedious to the court. Yet if 
need be, when the other gentlemen have given in their evidence, rather than any 
thing shall be wanting that will dispatch him, I will enlarge my testimony 
against him. So he was bid to stand by.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p33>Then they called Superstition, and bid him look upon the 
prisoner. They also asked, what he could say for their lord the king against 
him. Then they sware him; so he began.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p34><SPAN id=v.vi-p34.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">SUPERSTITION:</SPAN> My lord, I have no great 
acquaintance with this man, nor do I desire to have further knowledge of him. 
However, this I know, that he is a very pestilent fellow, from some discourse 
that I had with him the other day, in this town; for then, talking with him, I 
heard him say, that our religion was naught, and such by which a man could by no 
means please God. Which saying of his, my lord, your lordship very well knows 
what necessarily thence will follow, to wit, that we still do worship in vain, 
are yet in our sins, and finally shall be damned: and this is that which I have 
to say.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p35>Then was Pickthank sworn, and bid say what he knew in the behalf 
of their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p36><SPAN id=v.vi-p36.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">PICKTHANK:</SPAN> My lord, and you gentlemen 
all, this fellow I have known of a long time, and have heard him speak things 
that ought not to be spoken; for he hath railed on our noble prince Beelzebub, 
and hath spoken contemptibly of his honorable friends, whose names are, the Lord 
Old Man, the Lord Carnal Delight, the Lord Luxurious, the Lord Desire of Vain 
Glory, my old Lord Lechery, Sir Having Greedy, with all the rest of our 
nobility: and he hath said, moreover, that if all men were of his mind, if 
possible, there is not one of these noblemen should have any longer a being in 
this town. Besides, he hath not been afraid to rail on you, my lord, who are now 
appointed to be his judge, calling you an ungodly villain, with many other such 
like vilifying terms, with which he hath bespattered most of the gentry of our 
town.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p37>When this Pickthank had told his tale, the judge directed his 
speech to the prisoner at the bar, saying, Thou runagate, heretic, and traitor, 
hast thou heard what these honest gentlemen have witnessed against thee?</P>
<P id=v.vi-p38><SPAN id=v.vi-p38.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">FAITHFUL:</SPAN> May I speak a few words in my 
own defence?</P>
<P id=v.vi-p39><SPAN id=v.vi-p39.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">JUDGE:</SPAN> Sirrah, sirrah, thou deservest to 
live no longer, but to be slain immediately upon the place; yet, that all men 
may see our gentleness towards thee, let us hear what thou, vile runagate, hast 
to say.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p40><SPAN id=v.vi-p40.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">FAITHFUL:</SPAN> 1. I say, then, in answer to 
what Mr. Envy hath spoken, I never said aught but this, that what rule, or laws, 
or custom, or people, were flat against the word of God, are diametrically 
opposite to Christianity. If I have said amiss in this, convince me of my error, 
and I am ready here before you to make my recantation.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p41>2. As to the second, to wit, Mr. Superstition, and his charge 
against me, I said only this, that in the worship of God there is required a 
divine faith; but there can be no divine faith without a divine revelation of 
the will of God. Therefore, whatever is thrust into the worship of God that is 
not agreeable to divine revelation, cannot be done but by a human faith; which 
faith will not be profitable to eternal life.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p42>3. As to what Mr. Pickthank hath said, I say, (avoiding terms, as 
that I am said to rail, and the like,) that the prince of this town, with all 
the rabblement, his attendants, by this gentleman named, are more fit for a 
being in hell than in this town and country. And so the Lord have mercy upon 
me.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p43>Then the judge called to the jury, (who all this while stood by 
to hear and observe,) Gentlemen of the jury, you see this man about whom so 
great an uproar hath been made in this town; you have also heard what these 
worthy gentlemen have witnessed against him; also, you have heard his reply and 
confession: it lieth now in your breasts to hang him, or save his life; but yet 
I think meet to instruct you in our law.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p44>There was an act made in the days of Pharaoh the Great, servant 
to our prince, that, lest those of a contrary religion should multiply and grow 
too strong for him, their males should be thrown into the river. <SCRIPREF 
id=v.vi-p44.1 osisRef="Bible:Exod.1.22" parsed="|Exod|1|22|0|0" 
passage="Ex 1:22">Exod. 1:22</SCRIPREF>. There was also an act made in the days 
of Nebuchadnezzar the Great, another of his servants, that whoever would not 
fall down and worship his golden image, should be thrown into a fiery furnace. 
<SCRIPREF id=v.vi-p44.2 osisRef="Bible:Dan.3.6" parsed="|Dan|3|6|0|0" 
passage="Da 3:6">Dan. 3:6</SCRIPREF>. There was also an act made in the days of 
Darius, that whoso for some time called upon any god but him, should be cast 
into the lion’s den. <SCRIPREF id=v.vi-p44.3 osisRef="Bible:Dan.6.7" 
parsed="|Dan|6|7|0|0" passage="Da 6:7">Dan. 6:7</SCRIPREF>. Now, the substance 
of these laws this rebel has broken, not only in thought, (which is not to be 
borne,) but also in word and deed; which must, therefore, needs be 
intolerable.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p45>For that of Pharaoh, his law was made upon a supposition to 
prevent mischief, no crime being yet apparent; but here is a crime apparent. For 
the second and third, you see he disputeth against our religion; and for the 
treason that he hath already confessed, he deserveth to die the death.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p46>Then went the jury out, whose names were Mr. Blindman, Mr. 
No-good, Mr. Malice, Mr. Love-lust, Mr. Live-loose, Mr. Heady, Mr. High-mind, 
Mr. Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr. Hate-light, and Mr. Implacable; who every 
one gave in his private verdict against him among themselves, and afterwards 
unanimously concluded to bring him in guilty before the judge. And first among 
themselves, Mr. Blindman, the foreman, said, I see clearly that this man is a 
heretic. Then said Mr. No-good, Away with such a fellow from the earth. Aye, 
said Mr. Malice, for I hate the very looks of him. Then said Mr. Love-lust, I 
could never endure him. Nor I, said Mr. Live-loose, for he would always be 
condemning my way. Hang him, hang him, said Mr. Heady. A sorry scrub, said Mr. 
High-mind. My heart riseth against him, said Mr. Enmity. He is a rogue, said Mr. 
Liar. Hanging is too good for him, said Mr. Cruelty. Let us dispatch him out of 
the way, said Mr. Hate-light. Then said Mr. Implacable, Might I have all the 
world given me, I could not be reconciled to him; therefore let us forthwith 
bring him in guilty of death.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p47>And so they did; therefore he was presently condemned to be had 
from the place where he was, to the place from whence he came, and there to be 
put to the most cruel death that could be invented.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p48>They therefore brought him out, to do with him according to their 
law; and first they scourged him, then they buffeted him, then they lanced his 
flesh with knives; after that, they stoned him with stones, then pricked him 
with their swords; and last of all, they burned him to ashes at the stake. Thus 
came Faithful to his end.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p49>Now I saw, that there stood behind the multitude a chariot and a 
couple of horses waiting for Faithful, who (so soon as his adversaries had 
dispatched him) was taken up into it, and straightway was carried up through the 
clouds with sound of trumpet, the nearest way to the celestial gate. But as for 
Christian, he had some respite, and was remanded back to prison: so he there 
remained for a space. But he who overrules all things, having the power of their 
rage in his own hand, so wrought it about, that Christian for that time escaped 
them, and went his way.</P>
<P id=v.vi-p50>And as he went, he sang, saying,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Well, Faithful, 
thou hast faithfully profest<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

sing, and let thy name survive;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>For though they killed thee, thou art yet alive.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P class=div2>THE SEVENTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=v.vii-p0.1><A id=v.vii-p0.2></A>THE SEVENTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=v.vii-p1>Now I saw in my dream, that Christian went not forth alone; for 
there was one whose name was Hopeful, (being so made by the beholding of 
Christian and Faithful in their words and behavior, in their sufferings at the 
fair,) who joined himself unto him, and entering into a brotherly covenant, told 
him that he would be his companion. Thus one died to bear testimony to the 
truth, and another rises out of his ashes to be a companion with Christian in 
his pilgrimage. This Hopeful also told Christian, that there were many more of 
the men in the fair that would take their time, and follow after.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p2>So I saw, that quickly after they were got out of the fair, they 
overtook one that was going before them, whose name was By-ends; so they said to 
him, What countryman, sir? and how far go you this way? He told them, that he 
came from the town of Fair-speech, and he was going to the Celestial City; but 
told them not his name.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p3>From Fair-speech? said Christian; is there any good that lives 
there? <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p3.1 osisRef="Bible:Prov.26.25"

<P id=v.vii-p4><SPAN id=v.vii-p4.1

so.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p5><SPAN id=v.vii-p5.1

<P id=v.vii-p6><SPAN id=v.vii-p6.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">BY-ENDS:</SPAN> I am a stranger to you, and you 
to me: if you be going this way, I shall be glad of your company; if not, I must 
be content.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p7><SPAN id=v.vii-p7.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> This town of Fair-speech, 
said Christian, I have heard of; and, as I remember, they say it’s a wealthy 
place.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p8><SPAN id=v.vii-p8.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">BY-ENDS:</SPAN> Yes, I will assure you that it 
is; and I have very many rich kindred there.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p9><SPAN id=v.vii-p9.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Pray, who are your kindred 
there, if a man may be so bold?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p10><SPAN id=v.vii-p10.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">BY-ENDS:</SPAN> Almost the whole town; and in 
particular my Lord Turn-about, my Lord Time-server, my Lord Fair-speech, from 
whose ancestors that town first took its name; also, Mr. Smooth-man, Mr. 
Facing-both-ways, Mr. Any-thing; and the parson of our parish, Mr. Two-tongues, 
was my mother’s own brother, by father’s side; and, to tell you the truth, I am 
become a gentleman of good quality; yet my great-grandfather was but a waterman, 
looking one way and rowing another, and I got most of my estate by the same 
occupation.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p11><SPAN id=v.vii-p11.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Are you a married man.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p12><SPAN id=v.vii-p12.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">BY-ENDS:</SPAN> Yes, and my wife is a very 
virtuous woman, the daughter of a virtuous woman; she was my Lady Feigning’s 
daughter; therefore she came of a very honorable family, and is arrived to such 
a pitch of breeding, that she knows how to carry it to all, even to prince and 
peasant. ‘Tis true, we somewhat differ in religion from those of the stricter 
sort, yet but in two small points: First, we never strive against wind and tide. 
Secondly, we are always most zealous when religion goes in his silver slippers; 
we love much to walk with him in the street, if the sun shines and the people 
applaud him.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p13>Then Christian stepped a little aside to his fellow Hopeful, 
saying, it runs in my mind that this is one By-ends, of Fair-speech; and if it 
be he, we have as very a knave in our company as dwelleth in all these parts. 
Then said Hopeful, Ask him; methinks he should not be ashamed of his name. So 
Christian came up with him again, and said, Sir, you talk as if you knew 
something more than all the world doth; and, if I take not my mark amiss, I deem 
I have half a guess of you. Is not your name Mr. By-ends of Fair-speech?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p14><SPAN id=v.vii-p14.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">BY-ENDS:</SPAN> This is not my name, but indeed 
it is a nickname that is given me by some that cannot abide me, and I must be

me.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p15><SPAN id=v.vii-p15.1

the luck to jump in my judgment with the present way of the times, whatever it 
was, and my chance was to get thereby: but if things are thus cast upon me, let 
me count them a blessing; but let not the malicious load me therefore with 
reproach.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p17><SPAN id=v.vii-p17.1

<P id=v.vii-p20><SPAN id=v.vii-p20.1

<P id=v.vii-p22>Then said By-ends, I shall never desert my old principles, since 
they are harmless and profitable. If I may not go with you, I must do as I did 
before you overtook me, even go by myself, until some overtake me that will be 
glad of my company.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p23>Now I saw in my dream, that Christian and Hopeful forsook him, 
and kept their distance before him; but one of them, looking back, saw three men 
following Mr. By-ends; and, behold, as they came up with him, he made them a 
very low congee; and they also gave him a compliment. The men’s names were, Mr. 
Hold-the-world, Mr. Money-love, and Mr. Save-all, men that Mr. By-ends had 
formerly been acquainted with; for in their minority they were schoolfellows, 
and taught by one Mr. Gripeman, a schoolmaster in Lovegain, which is a 
market-town in the county of Coveting, in the North. This Schoolmaster taught 
them the art of getting, either by violence, cozenage, flattering, lying, or by 
putting on a guise of religion; and these four gentlemen had attained much of 
the art of their master, so that they could each of them have kept such a school 
themselves.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p24>Well, when they had, as I said, thus saluted each other, Mr. 
Money-love said to Mr. By-ends, Who are they upon the road before us? For 
Christian and Hopeful were yet within view.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p25><SPAN id=v.vii-p25.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">BY-ENDS:</SPAN> They are a couple of far 
country-men, that, after their mode, are going on pilgrimage.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p26><SPAN id=v.vii-p26.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
MONEY-LOVE:</SPAN> Alas! why did they not stay, that we might have had their 
good company? for they, and we, and you, sir, I hope, are all going on 
pilgrimage.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p27><SPAN id=v.vii-p27.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">BY-ENDS:</SPAN> We are so, indeed; but the men 
before us are so rigid, and love so much their own notions, and do also so

he jumps not with them in all things, they thrust him quite out of their 
company.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p28><SPAN id=v.vii-p28.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
SAVE-ALL:</SPAN> That is bad; but we read of some that are righteous overmuch, 
and such men’s rigidness prevails with them to judge and condemn all but 
themselves. But I pray, what, and how many, were the things wherein you 
differed?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p29><SPAN id=v.vii-p29.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">BY-ENDS:</SPAN> Why, they, after their 
headstrong manner, conclude that it is their duty to rush on their journey all 
weathers, and I am for waiting for wind and tide. They are for hazarding all for 
God at a clap; and I am for taking all advantages to secure my life and estate. 
They are for holding their notions, though all other men be against them; but I 
am for religion in what, and so far as the times and my safety will bear it. 
They are for religion when in rags and contempt; but I am for him when he walks 
in his silver slippers, in the sunshine, and with applause.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p30><SPAN id=v.vii-p30.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HOLD-THE-WORLD:</SPAN> Aye, and hold you there still, good Mr. By-ends; for, for 
my part, I can count him but a fool, that having the liberty to keep what he 
has, shall be so unwise as to lose it. Let us be wise as serpents. It is best to 
make hay while the sun shines. You see how the bee lieth still in winter, and 
bestirs her only when she can have profit with pleasure. God sends sometimes 
rain, and sometimes sunshine: if they be such fools to go through the first, yet 
let us be content to take fair weather along with us. For my part, I like that 
religion best that will stand with the security of God’s good blessings unto us; 
for who can imagine, that is ruled by his reason, since God has bestowed upon us 
the good things of this life, but that he would have us keep them for his sake? 
Abraham and Solomon grew rich in religion; and Job says, that a good man shall 
lay up gold as dust; but he must not be such as the men before us, if they be as 
you have described them.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p31><SPAN id=v.vii-p31.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
SAVE-ALL:</SPAN> I think that we are all agreed in this matter; and therefore 
there needs no more words about it.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p32><SPAN id=v.vii-p32.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
MONEY-LOVE:</SPAN> No, there needs no more words about this matter, indeed; for 
he that believes neither Scripture nor reason, (and you see we have both on our 
side,) neither knows his own liberty nor seeks his own safety.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p33><SPAN id=v.vii-p33.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">BY-ENDS:</SPAN> My brethren, we are, as you 
see, going all on pilgrimage; and for our better diversion from things that are 
bad, give me leave to propound unto you this question.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p34>Suppose a man, a minister, or a tradesman, etc., should have an 
advantage lie before him to get the good blessings of this life, yet so as that 
he can by no means come by them, except, in appearance at least, he becomes 
extraordinary zealous in some points of religion that he meddled not with 
before; may he not use this means to attain his end, and yet be a right honest 
man?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p35><SPAN id=v.vii-p35.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
MONEY-LOVE:</SPAN> I see the bottom of your question; and with these gentlemen’s 
good leave, I will endeavor to shape you an answer. And first, to speak to your 
question as it concerneth a minister himself: suppose a minister, a worthy man, 
possessed but of a very small benefice, and has in his eye a greater, more fat 
and plump by far; he has also now an opportunity of getting it, yet so as by 
being more studious, by preaching more frequently and zealously, and, because 
the temper of the people requires it, by altering of some of his principles; for 
my part, I see no reason why a man may not do this, provided he has a call, aye, 
and more a great deal besides, and yet be an honest man. For why?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p36>1. His desire of a greater benefice is lawful, (this cannot be 
contradicted,) since it is set before him by Providence; so then he may get it 
if he can, making no question for conscience’ sake.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p37>2. Besides, his desire after that benefice makes him more 
studious, a more zealous preacher, etc., and so makes him a better man, yea, 
makes him better improve his parts, which is according to the mind of God.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p38>3. Now, as for his complying with the temper of his people, by 
deserting, to serve them, some of his principles, this argueth, 1. That he is of 
a self-denying temper. 2. Of a sweet and winning deportment. And, 3. So more fit 
for the ministerial function.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p39>4. I conclude, then, that a minister that changes a small for a 
great, should not, for so doing, be judged as covetous; but rather, since he is 
improved in his parts and industry thereby, be counted as one that pursues his 
call, and the opportunity put into his hand to do good.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p40>And now to the second part of the question, which concerns the 
tradesman you mentioned. Suppose such an one to have but a poor employ in the 
world, but by becoming religious he may mend his market, perhaps get a rich 
wife, or more and far better customers to his shop; for my part, I see no reason 
but this may be lawfully done. For why?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p41>1. To become religious is a virtue, by what means soever a man 
becomes so.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p42>2. Nor is it unlawful to get a rich wife, or more custom to my 
shop.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p43>3. Besides, the man that gets these by becoming religious, gets 
that which is good of them that are good, by becoming good himself; so then here 
is a good wife, and good customers, and good gain, and all these by becoming 
religious, which is good: therefore, to become religious to get all these is a 
good and profitable design.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p44>This answer, thus made by Mr. Money-love to Mr. By-ends’ 
question, was highly applauded by them all; wherefore they concluded, upon the 
whole, that it was most wholesome and advantageous. And because, as they 
thought, no man was able to contradict it; and because Christian and Hopeful 
were yet within call, they jointly agreed to assault them with the question as 
soon as they overtook them; and the rather, because they had opposed Mr. By-ends 
before. So they called after them, and they stopped and stood still till they 
came up to them; but they concluded, as they went, that not Mr. By-ends, but old 
Mr. Hold-the-world should propound the question to them, because, as they 
supposed, their answer to him would be without the remainder of that heat that 
was kindled betwixt Mr. By-ends and them at their parting a little before.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p45>So they came up to each other, and after a short salutation, Mr. 
Hold-the-world propounded the question to Christian and his fellow, and then bid 
them to answer if they could.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p46>Then said Christian, Even a babe in religion may answer ten 
thousand such questions. For if it be unlawful to follow Christ for loaves, as 
it is, <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p46.1 osisRef="Bible:John.6.26" 
parsed="|John|6|26|0|0" passage="Jn 6:26">John 6:26</SCRIPREF>; how much more 
abominable is it to make of him and religion a stalking-horse to get and enjoy 
the world! Nor do we find any other than heathens, hypocrites, devils, and 
wizards, that are of this opinion.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p47>1. Heathens: for when Hamor and Shechem had a mind to the 
daughter and cattle of Jacob, and saw that there was no way for them to come at 
them but by being circumcised, they said to their companions, If every male of 
us be circumcised, as they are circumcised, shall not their cattle, and their 
substance, and every beast of theirs be ours? Their daughters and their cattle 
were that which they sought to obtain, and their religion the stalking-horse 
they made use of to come at them. Read the whole story, <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p47.1 
osisRef="Bible:Gen.34.20-Gen.34.24" parsed="|Gen|34|20|34|24" 
passage="Ge 34:20-24">Gen. 34:20-24</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p48>2. The hypocritical Pharisees were also of this religion: long 
prayers were their pretence, but to get widows’ houses was their intent; and 
greater damnation was from God their judgment. <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p48.1 
osisRef="Bible:Luke.20.46 Bible:Luke.20.47" 
parsed="|Luke|20|46|0|0;|Luke|20|47|0|0" passage="Lk 20:46,47">Luke 
20:46,47</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p49>3. Judas the devil was also of this religion: he was religious 
for the bag, that he might be possessed of what was put therein; but he was 
lost, cast away, and the very son of perdition.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p50>4. Simon the wizard was of this religion too; for he would have 
had the Holy Ghost, that he might have got money therewith: and his sentence 
from Peter’s mouth was according. <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p50.1 
osisRef="Bible:Acts.8.19-Acts.8.22" parsed="|Acts|8|19|8|22" 
passage="Ac 8:19-22">Acts 8:19-22</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p51>5. Neither will it go out of my mind, but that that man who 
takes up religion for the world, will throw away religion for the world; for so 
surely as Judas designed the world in becoming religious, so surely did he also 
sell religion and his Master for the same. To answer the question, therefore, 
affirmatively, as I perceive you have done, and to accept of, as authentic, such 
answer, is heathenish, hypocritical, and devilish; and your reward will be 
according to your works.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p52>Then they stood staring one upon another, but had not wherewith 
to answer Christian. Hopeful also approved of the soundness of Christian’s 
answer; so there was a great silence among them. Mr. By-ends and his company 
also staggered and kept behind, that Christian and Hopeful might outgo them. 
Then said Christian to his fellow, If these men cannot stand before the sentence 
of men, what will they do with the sentence of God? And if they are mute when 
dealt with by vessels of clay, what will they do when they shall be rebuked by 
the flames of a devouring fire?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p53>Then Christian and Hopeful outwent them again, and went till 
they came at a delicate plain, called Ease, where they went with much content; 
but that plain was but narrow, so they were quickly got over it. Now at the 
farther side of that plain was a little hill, called Lucre, and in that hill a 
silver-mine, which some of them that had formerly gone that way, because of the 
rarity of it, had turned aside to see; but going too near the brim of the pit, 
the ground, being deceitful under them, broke, and they were slain: some also 
had been maimed there, and could not, to their dying day, be their own men 
again.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p54>Then I saw in my dream, that a little off the road, over against 
the silver-mine, stood Demas (gentleman-like) to call passengers to come and 
see; who said to Christian and his fellow, Ho! turn aside hither, and I will 
show you a thing.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p55><SPAN id=v.vii-p55.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> What thing so deserving as to 
turn us out of the way to see it?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p56><SPAN id=v.vii-p56.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">DEMAS:</SPAN> Here is a silver-mine, and some 
digging in it for treasure; if you will come, with a little pains you may richly 
provide for yourselves.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p57><SPAN id=v.vii-p57.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> Then said Hopeful, let us go 
see.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p58><SPAN id=v.vii-p58.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Not I, said Christian: I have 
heard of this place before now, and how many there have been slain; and besides, 
that treasure is a snare to those that seek it, for it hindereth them in their 
pilgrimage.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p59>Then Christian called to Demas, saying, Is not the place 
dangerous? Hath it not hindered many in their pilgrimage? <SCRIPREF

<P id=v.vii-p60><SPAN id=v.vii-p60.1

Hopeful, Let us not stir a step, but still keep on our way.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p62><SPAN id=v.vii-p62.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> I will warrant you, when 
By-ends comes up, if he hath the same invitation as we, he will turn in thither 
to see.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p63><SPAN id=v.vii-p63.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> No doubt thereof, for his 
principles lead him that way, and a hundred to one but he dies there.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p64><SPAN id=v.vii-p64.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">DEMAS:</SPAN> Then Demas called again, saying, 
But will you not come over and see?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p65><SPAN id=v.vii-p65.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Then Christian roundly 
answered, saying, Demas, thou art an enemy to the right ways of the Lord of this 
way, and hast been already condemned for thine own turning aside, by one of his 
Majesty’s judges, <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p65.2 osisRef="Bible:2Tim.4.10" 
parsed="|2Tim|4|10|0|0" passage="2 Ti 4:10">2 Tim. 4:10</SCRIPREF>; and why 
seekest thou to bring us into the like condemnation? Besides, if we at all turn 
aside, our Lord the King will certainly hear thereof, and will there put us to 
shame, where we would stand with boldness before him.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p66>Demas cried again, that he also was one of their fraternity; and 
that if they would tarry a little, he also himself would walk with them.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p67><SPAN id=v.vii-p67.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Then said Christian, What is 
thy name? Is it not the same by which I have called thee?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p68><SPAN id=v.vii-p68.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">DEMAS:</SPAN> Yes, my name is Demas; I am the 
son of Abraham.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p69><SPAN id=v.vii-p69.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> I know you; Gehazi was your 
great-grandfather, and Judas your father, and you have trod in their steps; it 
is but a devilish prank that thou usest: thy father was hanged for a traitor, 
and thou deservest no better reward. <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p69.2 
osisRef="Bible:2Kgs.5.20-2Kgs.5.27" parsed="|2Kgs|5|20|5|27"

King, we will tell him of this thy behavior. Thus they went their way.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p70>By this time By-ends and his companions were come again within 
sight, and they at the first beck went over to Demas. Now, whether they fell 
into the pit by looking over the brink thereof, or whether they went down to 
dig, or whether they were smothered in the bottom by the damps that commonly 
arise, of these things I am not certain; but this I observed, that they were 
never seen again in the way. Then sang Christian,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“By-ends and 
silver Demas both agree;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=v.vii-p71>Now I saw that, just on the other side of this plain, the 
pilgrims came to a place where stood an old monument, hard by the highway-side, 
at the sight of which they were both concerned, because of the strangeness of 
the form thereof; for it seemed to them as if it had been a woman transformed 
into the shape of a pillar. Here, therefore, they stood looking and looking upon 
it, but could not for a time tell what they should make thereof. At last Hopeful 
espied, written above upon the head thereof, a writing in an unusual hand; but 
he being no scholar, called to Christian (for he was learned) to see if he could 
pick out the meaning: so he came, and after a little laying of letters together, 
he found the same to be this, “Remember Lot’s wife.” So he read it to his 
fellow; after which they both concluded that that was the pillar of salt into 
which Lot’s wife was turned, for her looking back with a covetous heart when she 
was going from Sodom for safety. <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p71.1 
osisRef="Bible:Gen.19.26" parsed="|Gen|19|26|0|0" passage="Ge 19:26">Gen.

discourse.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p72><SPAN id=v.vii-p72.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Ah, my brother, this is a 
seasonable sight: it came opportunely to us after the invitation which Demas 
gave us to come over to view the hill Lucre; and had we gone over, as he desired 
us, and as thou wast inclined to do, my brother, we had, for aught I know, been 
made, like this woman, a spectacle for those that shall come after to 
behold.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p73><SPAN id=v.vii-p73.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> I am sorry that I was so 
foolish, and am made to wonder that I am not now as Lot’s wife; for wherein was 
the difference betwixt her sin and mine? She only looked back, and I had a 
desire to go see. Let grace be adored; and let me be ashamed that ever such a 
thing should be in mine heart.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p74><SPAN id=v.vii-p74.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Let us take notice of what we 
see here, for our help from time to come. This woman escaped one judgment, for 
she fell not by the destruction of Sodom; yet she was destroyed by another, as 
we see: she is turned into a pillar of salt.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p75><SPAN id=v.vii-p75.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> True, and she may be to us both 
caution and example; caution, that we should shun her sin; or a sign of what 
judgment will overtake such as shall not be prevented by this caution: so Korah, 
Dathan, and Abiram, with the two hundred and fifty</P>
<P id=v.vii-p76>men that perished in their sin, did also become a sign or

wit, how Demas and his fellows can stand so confidently yonder to look for that 
treasure, which this woman but for looking behind her after, (for we read not 
that she stepped one foot out of the way,) was turned into a pillar of salt; 
especially since the judgment which overtook her did make her an example within 
sight of where they are; for they cannot choose but see her, did they but lift 
up their eyes.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p77><SPAN id=v.vii-p77.1

at, and it argueth that their hearts are grown desperate in the case; and I 
cannot tell who to compare them to so fitly, as to them that pick pockets in the 
presence of the judge, or that will cut purses under the gallows. It is said of 
the men of Sodom, that they were “sinners exceedingly,” because they were 
sinners “before the Lord,” that is, in his eyesight, and notwithstanding the 
kindnesses that he had shown them; for the land of Sodom was now like the garden

the more to jealousy, and made their plague as hot as the fire of the Lord out 
of heaven could make it. And it is most rationally to be concluded, that such, 
even such as these are, that shall sin in the sight, yea, and that too in 
despite of such examples that are set continually before them, to caution them 
to the contrary, must be partakers of severest judgments.</P>

<P id=v.vii-p79>I saw then that they went on their way to a pleasant river, 
which David the king called “the river of God;” but John, “the river of the 
water of life.” <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p79.1 osisRef="Bible:Ps.65.9"

bank of this river: here, therefore, Christian and his companion walked with 
great delight; they drank also of the water of the river, which was pleasant and 
enlivening to their weary spirits. Besides, on the banks of this river, on 
either side, were green trees with all manner of fruit; and the leaves they ate 
to prevent surfeits, and other diseases that are incident to those that heat 
their blood by travel. On either side of the river was also a meadow, curiously 
beautified with lilies; and it was green all the year long. In this meadow they 
lay down and slept, for here they might lie down safely. <SCRIPREF

and drank again of the water of the river, and then lay down again to sleep. 
Thus they did several days and nights. Then they sang;</P><SPAN

<P id=v.vii-p80>So when they were disposed to go on, (for they were not as yet 
at their journey’s end,) they ate, and drank, and departed.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p81>Now I beheld in my dream, that they had not journeyed far, but 
the river and the way for a time parted, at which they were not a little sorry; 
yet they durst not go out of the way. Now the way from the river was rough, and 
their feet tender by reason of their travels; so the souls of the pilgrims were 
much discouraged because of the way. <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p81.1 
osisRef="Bible:Num.21.4" parsed="|Num|21|4|0|0" passage="Nu 21:4">Numb.

Now, a little before them, there was on the left hand of the road a meadow, and 
a stile to go over into it, and that meadow is called By-path meadow. Then said 
Christian to his fellow, If this meadow lieth along by our wayside, let’s go 
over into it. Then he went to the stile to see, and behold a path lay along by 
the way on the other side of the fence. It is according to my wish, said 
Christian; here is the easiest going; come, good Hopeful, and let us go 
over.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p82><SPAN id=v.vii-p82.1

<P id=v.vii-p83><SPAN id=v.vii-p83.1

other. Look, doth it not go along by the wayside? So Hopeful, being persuaded by 
his fellow, went after him over the stile. When they were gone over, and were 
got into the path, they found it very easy for their feet; and withal, they, 
looking before them, espied a man walking as they did, and his name was 
Vain-Confidence: so they called after him, and asked him whither that way led. 
He said, To the Celestial Gate. Look, said Christian, did not I tell you so? by 
this you may see we are right. So they followed, and he went before them. But 
behold the night came on, and it grew very dark; so that they that went behind 
lost the sight of him that went before.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p84>He therefore that went before, (Vain-Confidence by name,) not 
seeing the way before him, fell into a deep pit, which was on purpose there 
made, by the prince of those grounds, to catch vain-glorious fools withal, and 
was dashed in pieces with his fall. <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p84.1

<P id=v.vii-p85>Now, Christian and his fellow heard him fall. So they called to 
know the matter, but there was none to answer, only they heard a groaning. Then 
said Hopeful, Where are we now? Then was his fellow silent, as mistrusting that 
he had led him out of the way; and now it began to rain, and thunder, and 
lighten in a most dreadful manner, and the water rose amain.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p86>Then Hopeful groaned in himself, saying, Oh that I had kept on

style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> No, said Hopeful, you shall not 
go first, for your mind being troubled may lead you out of the way again. Then 
for their encouragement they heard the voice of one saying, “Let thine heart be 
toward the highway, even the way that thou wentest: turn again.” <SCRIPREF

greatly risen, by reason of which the way of going back was very dangerous. 
(Then I thought that it is easier going out of the way when we are in, than 
going in when we are out.) Yet they adventured to go back; but it was so dark, 
and the flood was so high, that in their going back they had like to have been 
drowned nine or ten times.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p95>Neither could they, with all the skill they had, get again to 
the stile that night. Wherefore at last, lighting under a little shelter, they 
sat down there till the day brake; but being weary, they fell asleep. Now there 
was, not far from the place where they lay, a castle, called Doubting Castle, 
the owner whereof was Giant Despair, and it was in his grounds they now were 
sleeping: wherefore he, getting up in the morning early, and walking up and down 
in his fields, caught Christian and Hopeful asleep in his grounds. Then with a 
grim and surly voice, he bid them awake, and asked them whence they were, and 
what they did in his grounds. They told him they were pilgrims, and that they 
had lost their way. Then said the giant, You have this night trespassed on me by 
trampling in and lying on my grounds, and therefore you must go along with me. 
So they were forced to go, because he was stronger than they. They also had but 
little to say, for they knew themselves in a fault. The giant, therefore, drove 
them before him, and put them into his castle, into a very dark dungeon, nasty 
and stinking to the spirits of these two men. Here, then, they lay from 
Wednesday morning till Saturday night, without one bit of bread, or drop of 
drink, or light, or any to ask how they did; they were, therefore, here in evil 
case, and were far from friends and acquaintance. <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p95.1 
osisRef="Bible:Ps.88.18" parsed="|Ps|88|18|0|0" passage="Ps 88:18">Psa. 
88:18</SCRIPREF>. Now in this place Christian had double sorrow, because it was 
through his unadvised counsel that they were brought into this distress.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p96>Now Giant Despair had a wife, and her name was Diffidence: so 
when he was gone to bed he told his wife what he had done, to wit, that he had 
taken a couple of prisoners, and cast them into his dungeon for trespassing on 
his grounds. Then he asked her also what he had best do further to them. So she 
asked him what they were, whence they came, and whither they were bound, and he 
told her. Then she counseled him, that when he arose in the morning he should 
beat them without mercy. So when he arose, he getteth him a grievous crab-tree 
cudgel, and goes down into the dungeon to them, and there first falls to rating 
of them as if they were dogs, although they gave him never a word of distaste. 
Then he falls upon them, and beats them fearfully, in such sort that they were 
not able to help themselves, or to turn them upon the floor. This done, he 
withdraws and leaves them there to condole their misery, and to mourn under 
their distress: so all that day they spent the time in nothing but sighs and 
bitter lamentations. The next night, she, talking with her husband further about 
them, and understanding that they were yet alive, did advise him to counsel them 
to make away with themselves. So when morning was come, he goes to them in a 
surly manner, as before, and perceiving them to be very sore with the stripes 
that he had given them the day before, he told them, that since they were never 
like to come out of that place, their only way would be forthwith to make an end 
of themselves, either with knife, halter, or poison; for why, said he, should 
you choose to live, seeing it is attended with so much bitterness? But they 
desired him to let them go. With that he looked ugly upon them, and rushing to 
them, had doubtless made an end of them himself, but that he fell into one of 
his fits, (for he sometimes in sunshiny weather fell into fits,) and lost for a 
time the use of his hands; wherefore he withdrew, and left them as before to 
consider what to do. Then did the prisoners consult between themselves whether 
it was best to take his counsel or no; and thus they began to discourse:</P>
<P id=v.vii-p97><SPAN id=v.vii-p97.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> Brother, said Christian, what 
shall we do? The life that we now live is miserable. For my part, I know not 
whether it is best to live thus, or to die out of hand. My soul chooseth 
strangling rather than life, and the grave is more easy for me than this 
dungeon. <SCRIPREF id=v.vii-p97.2 osisRef="Bible:Job.7.15" 
parsed="|Job|7|15|0|0" passage="Job 7:15">Job. 7:15</SCRIPREF>. Shall we be 
ruled by the giant?</P>
<P id=v.vii-p98><SPAN id=v.vii-p98.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> Indeed our present condition is 
dreadful, and death would be far more welcome to me than thus for ever to abide; 
but yet, let us consider, the Lord of the country to which we are going hath 
said, “Thou shalt do no murder,” no, not to another man’s person; much more, 
then, are we forbidden to take his counsel to kill ourselves. Besides, he that 
kills another, can but commit murder upon his body; but for one to kill himself, 
is to kill body and soul at once. And moreover, my brother, thou talkest of ease 
in the grave; but hast thou forgotten the hell whither for certain the murderers 
go? for “no murderer hath eternal life,” etc. And let us consider again, that 
all the law is not in the hand of Giant Despair: others, so far as I can 
understand, have been taken by him as well as we, and yet have escaped out of 
his hands. Who knows but that God, who made the world, may cause that Giant 
Despair may die; or that, at some time or other, he may forget to lock us in; or 
that he may, in a short time, have another of his fits before us, and may lose 
the use of his limbs? And if ever that should come to pass again, for my part, I 
am resolved to pluck up the heart of a man, and to try my utmost to get from 
under his hand. I was a fool that I did not try to do it before. But, however, 
my brother, let us be patient, and endure a while: the time may come that may 
give us a happy release; but let us not be our own murderers. With these words 
Hopeful at present did moderate the mind of his brother; so they continued 
together in the dark that day, in their sad and doleful condition.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p99>Well, towards evening the giant goes down into the dungeon 
again, to see if his prisoners had taken his counsel. But when he came there he 
found them alive; and truly, alive was all; for now, what for want of bread and 
water, and by reason of the wounds they received when he beat them, they could 
do little but breathe. But I say, he found them alive; at which he fell into a 
grievous rage, and told them, that seeing they had disobeyed his counsel, it 
should be worse with them than if they had never been born.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p100>At this they trembled greatly, and I think that Christian fell 
into a swoon; but coming a little to himself again, they renewed their discourse 
about the giant’s counsel, and whether yet they had best take it or no. Now 
Christian again seemed for doing it; but Hopeful made his second reply as 
followeth:</P>
<P id=v.vii-p101><SPAN id=v.vii-p101.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> My brother, said he, 
rememberest thou not how valiant thou hast been heretofore? Apollyon could not 
crush thee, nor could all that thou didst hear, or see, or feel, in the Valley 
of the Shadow of Death. What hardship, terror, and amazement hast thou already 
gone through; and art thou now nothing but fears! Thou seest that I am in the 
dungeon with thee, a far weaker man by nature than thou art. Also this giant 
hath wounded me as well as thee, and hath also cut off the bread and water from 
my mouth, and with thee I mourn without the light. But let us exercise a little 
more patience. Remember how thou playedst the man at Vanity Fair, and wast 
neither afraid of the chain nor cage, nor yet of bloody death: wherefore let us 
(at least to avoid the shame that it becomes not a Christian to be found in) 
bear up with patience as well as we can.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p102>Now night being come again, and the giant and his wife being in 
bed, she asked him concerning the prisoners, and if they had taken his counsel: 
to which he replied, They are sturdy rogues; they choose rather to bear all 
hardships than to make away with themselves. Then said she, Take them into the 
castle-yard to-morrow, and show them the bones and skulls of those that thou 
hast already dispatched, and make them believe, ere a week comes to an end, thou 
wilt tear them in pieces, as thou hast done their fellows before them.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p103>So when the morning was come, the giant goes to them again, and 
takes them into the castle-yard, and shows them as his wife had bidden him. 
These, said he, were pilgrims, as you are, once, and they trespassed on my 
grounds, as you have done; and when I thought fit I tore them in pieces; and so 
within ten days I will do you: get you down to your den again. And with that he 
beat them all the way thither. They lay, therefore, all day on Saturday in a 
lamentable case, as before. Now, when night was come, and when Mrs. Diffidence 
and her husband the giant was got to bed, they began to renew their discourse of 
their prisoners; and withal, the old giant wondered that he could neither by his 
blows nor counsel bring them to an end. And with that his wife replied, I fear, 
said she, that they live in hopes that some will come to relieve them; or that 
they have picklocks about them, by the means of which they hope to escape. And 
sayest thou so, my dear? said the giant; I will therefore search them in the 
morning.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p104>Well, on Saturday, about midnight they began to pray, and 
continued in prayer till almost break of day.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p105>Now, a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half 
amazed, brake out into this passionate speech: What a fool, quoth he, am I, thus 
to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty! I have a key 
in my bosom, called Promise, that will, I am persuaded, open any lock in 
Doubting Castle. Then said Hopeful, That is good news; good brother, pluck it 
out of thy bosom, and try.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p106>Then Christian pulled it out of his bosom, and began to try at 
the dungeon-door, whose bolt, as he turned the key, gave back, and the door flew 
open with ease, and Christian and Hopeful both came out. Then he went to the 
outward door that leads into the castle-yard, and with his key opened that door 
also. After he went to the iron gate, for that must be opened too; but that lock 
went desperately hard, yet the key did open it. They then thrust open the gate 
to make their escape with speed; but that gate, as it opened, made such a 
creaking, that it waked Giant Despair, who hastily rising to pursue his 
prisoners, felt his limbs to fail, for his fits took him again, so that he could 
by no means go after them. Then they went on, and came to the King’s highway, 
and so were safe, because they were out of his jurisdiction.</P>
<P id=v.vii-p107>Now, when they were gone over the stile, they began to contrive 
with themselves what they should do at that stile, to prevent those that shall 
come after from falling into the hands of Giant Despair. So they consented to 
erect there a pillar, and to engrave upon the side thereof this sentence: “Over 
this stile is the way to Doubting Castle, which is kept by Giant Despair, who 
despiseth the King of’ the Celestial country, and seeks to destroy his holy 
pilgrims.” Many, therefore, that followed after, read what was written, and 
escaped the danger. This done, they sang as follows:</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Out of the way 
we went, and then we found<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

trespassing, his prisoners are,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

<P class=div2>THE EIGHTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=v.viii-p0.1><A id=v.viii-p0.2></A>THE EIGHTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=v.viii-p1>They went then till they came to the Delectable Mountains, which 
mountains belong to the Lord of that hill of which we have spoken before. So 
they went up to the mountains, to behold the gardens and orchards, the vineyards 
and fountains of water; where also they drank and washed themselves, and did 
freely eat of the vineyards. Now, there were on the tops of these mountains 
shepherds feeding their flocks, and they stood by the highway-side. The 
pilgrims, therefore, went to them, and leaning upon their staffs, (as is common 
with weary pilgrims when they stand to talk with any by the way,) they asked, 
Whose Delectable Mountains are these; and whose be the sheep that feed upon 
them?</P>

<P id=v.viii-p11>I saw also in my dream, that when the shepherds perceived that 
they were wayfaring men, they also put questions to them, (to which they made 
answer as in other places,) as, Whence came you? and, How got you into the way? 
and, By what means have you so persevered therein? for but few of them that 
begin to come hither, do show their face on these mountains. But when the 
shepherds heard their answers, being pleased therewith, they looked very 
lovingly upon them, and said, Welcome to the Delectable Mountains.</P>
<P id=v.viii-p12>The shepherds, I say, whose names were Knowledge, Experience, 
Watchful, and Sincere, took them by the hand, and had them to their tents, and 
made them partake of that which was ready at present. They said moreover, We 
would that you should stay here a while, to be acquainted with us, and yet more 
to solace yourselves with the good of these Delectable Mountains. Then they told 
them that they were content to stay. So they went to their rest that night, 
because it was very late.</P>
<P id=v.viii-p13>Then I saw in my dream, that in the morning the shepherds 
called up Christian and Hopeful to walk with them upon the mountains. So they 
went forth with them, and walked a while, having a pleasant prospect on every 
side. Then said the shepherds one to another, Shall we show these pilgrims some 
wonders? So when they had concluded to do it, they had them first to the top of 
a hill called Error, which was very steep on the farthest side, and bid them 
look down to the bottom. So Christian and Hopeful looked down, and saw at the 
bottom several men dashed all to pieces by a fall that they had had from the 
top. Then said Christian, What meaneth this? The shepherds answered, Have you 
not heard of them that were made to err, by hearkening to Hymenius and Philetus, 
as concerning the faith of the resurrection of the body? <SCRIPREF

continued to this day unburied, as you see, for an example to others to take 
heed how they clamber too high, or how they come too near the brink of this 
mountain.</P>
<P id=v.viii-p14>Then I saw that they had them to the top of another mountain, 
and the name of that is Caution, and bid them look afar off; which, when they 
did, they perceived, as they thought, several men walking up and down among the 
tombs that were there; and they perceived that the men were blind, because they 
stumbled sometimes upon the tombs, and because they could not get out from among 
them. Then said Christian, What means this?</P>
<P id=v.viii-p15>The shepherds then answered, Did you not see, a little below 
these mountains, a stile that led into a meadow, on the left hand of this way? 
They answered, Yes. Then said the shepherds, From that stile there goes a path 
that leads directly to Doubting Castle, which is kept by Giant Despair; and 
these men (pointing to them among the tombs) came once on pilgrimage, as you do 
now, even until they came to that same stile. And because the right way was 
rough in that place, they chose to go out of it into that meadow, and there were 
taken by Giant Despair, and cast into Doubting Castle; where after they had a 
while been kept in the dungeon, he at last did put out their eyes, and led them 
among those tombs, where he has left them to wander to this very day, that the 
saying of the wise man might be fulfilled, “He that wandereth out of the way of 
understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.” <SCRIPREF 
id=v.viii-p15.1 osisRef="Bible:Prov.21.16" parsed="|Prov|21|16|0|0" 
passage="Pr 21:16">Prov. 21:16</SCRIPREF>. Then Christian and Hopeful looked 
upon one another, with tears gushing out, but yet said nothing to the 
shepherds.</P>
<P id=v.viii-p16>Then I saw in my dream, that the shepherds had them to another 
place in a bottom, where was a door on the side of a hill; and they opened the 
door, and bid them look in. They looked in, therefore, and saw that within it 
was very dark and smoky; they also thought that they heard there a rumbling 
noise, as of fire, and a cry of some tormented, and that they smelt the scent of 
brimstone. Then said Christian, What means this? The shepherds told them, This 
is a by-way to hell, a way that hypocrites go in at; namely, such as sell their 
birthright, with Esau; such as sell their Master, with Judas; such as blaspheme 
the Gospel, with Alexander; and that lie and dissemble, with Ananias and 
Sapphira his wife.</P>
<P id=v.viii-p17>Then said Hopeful to the shepherds, I perceive that these had 
on them, even every one, a show of pilgrimage, as we have now; had they not?</P>
<P id=v.viii-p18><SPAN id=v.viii-p18.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">THE

<P id=v.viii-p19><SPAN id=v.viii-p19.1

pilgrimage in their day, since they, notwithstanding, were miserably cast

<P id=v.viii-p20><SPAN id=v.viii-p20.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">THE 
SHEPHERDS:</SPAN> Some farther, and some not so far as these mountains.</P>
<P id=v.viii-p21>Then said the pilgrims one to the other, We had need to cry to 
the Strong for strength.</P>
<P id=v.viii-p22><SPAN id=v.viii-p22.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">THE 
SHEPHERDS:</SPAN> Aye, and you will have need to use it, when you have it, 
too.</P>
<P id=v.viii-p23>By this time the pilgrims had a desire to go forward, and the 
shepherds a desire they should; so they walked together towards the end of the 
mountains. Then said the shepherds one to another, Let us here show the pilgrims 
the gates of the Celestial City, if they have skill to look through our 
perspective glass. The pilgrims lovingly accepted the motion: so they had them 
to the top of a high hill, called Clear, and gave them the glass to look.</P>
<P id=v.viii-p24>Then they tried to look; but the remembrance of that last thing 
that the shepherds had shown them made their hands shake, by means of which 
impediment they could not look steadily through the glass; yet they thought they 
saw something like the gate, and also some of the glory of the place. Then they 
went away, and sang,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Thus by the shepherds secrets are reveal’d,<SPAN

class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=v.viii-p25>When they were about to depart, one of the shepherds gave them 
a note of the way. Another of them bid them beware of the Flatterer. The third 
bid them take heed that they slept not upon Enchanted Ground. And the fourth bid 
them God speed. So I awoke from my dream.</P>
<P class=div2>THE NINTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=v.ix-p0.1><A id=v.ix-p0.2></A>THE NINTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=v.ix-p1>And I slept, and dreamed again, and saw the same two pilgrims 
going down the mountains along the highway towards the city. Now, a little below 
these mountains, on the left hand, lieth the country of Conceit, from which 
country there comes into the way in which the pilgrims walked, a little crooked 
lane. Here, therefore, they met with a very brisk lad that came out of that 
country, and his name was Ignorance. So Christian asked him from what parts he 
came, and whither he was going.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p2><SPAN id=v.ix-p2.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">IGNORANCE:</SPAN> Sir, I was born in the

<P id=v.ix-p3><SPAN id=v.ix-p3.1

<P id=v.ix-p4><SPAN id=v.ix-p4.1

he.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p5><SPAN id=v.ix-p5.1

that gate, that the gate should be opened to you?</P>
<P id=v.ix-p6><SPAN id=v.ix-p6.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">IGNORANCE:</SPAN> I know my Lord’s will, and

give alms, and have left my country for whither I am going.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p7><SPAN id=v.ix-p7.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> But thou camest not in at the 
wicket-gate, that is at the head of this way; thou camest in hither through that 
same crooked lane, and therefore I fear, however thou mayest think of thyself, 
when the reckoning-day shall come, thou wilt have laid to thy charge, that thou 
art a thief and a robber, instead of getting admittance into the city.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p8><SPAN id=v.ix-p8.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">IGNORANCE:</SPAN> Gentlemen, ye be utter 
strangers to me; I know you not: be content to follow the religion of your 
country, and I will follow the religion of mine. I hope all will be well. And as 
for the gate that you talk of, all the world knows that is a great way off of 
our country. I cannot think that any man in all our parts doth so much as know 
the way to it; nor need they matter whether they do or no, since we have, as you 
see, a fine, pleasant, green lane, that comes down from our country, the next 
way into the way.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p9>When Christian saw that the man was wise in his own conceit, he 
said to Hopeful whisperingly, “There is more hope of a fool than of him.” 
<SCRIPREF id=v.ix-p9.1 osisRef="Bible:Prov.26.12" parsed="|Prov|26|12|0|0"

that he is a fool. <SCRIPREF id=v.ix-p9.2 osisRef="Bible:Eccl.10.3" 
parsed="|Eccl|10|3|0|0" passage="Ecc 10:3">Eccles. 10:3</SCRIPREF>. What, shall 
we talk farther with him, or outgo him at present, and so leave him to think of 
what he hath heard already, and then stop again for him afterwards, and see if 
by degrees we can do any good to him? Then said Hopeful,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Let Ignorance a 
little while now muse<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

<P id=v.ix-p10><SPAN id=v.ix-p10.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> He further added, It is not 
good, I think, to say so to him all at once; let us pass him by, if you will, 
and talk to him anon, even as he is able to bear it.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p11>So they both went on, and Ignorance he came after. Now, when they 
had passed him a little way, they entered into a very dark lane, where they met 
a man whom seven devils had bound with seven strong cords, and were carrying him 
back to the door that they saw on the side of the hill. <SCRIPREF id=v.ix-p11.1 
osisRef="Bible:Matt.12.45" parsed="|Matt|12|45|0|0" passage="Mt 12:45">Matt.

parsed="|Prov|5|22|0|0" passage="Pr 5:22">Prov. 5:22</SCRIPREF>. Now good 
Christian began to tremble, and so did Hopeful, his companion; yet, as the 
devils led away the man, Christian looked to see if he knew him; and he thought 
it might be one Turn-away, that dwelt in the town of Apostacy. But he did not 
perfectly see his face, for he did hang his head like a thief that is found; but 
being gone past, Hopeful looked after him, and espied on his back a paper with 
this inscription, “Wanton professor, and damnable apostate.”</P>
<P id=v.ix-p12>Then said Christian to his fellow, Now I call to remembrance that 
which was told me of a thing that happened to a good man hereabout. The name of 
the man was Little-Faith; but a good man, and he dwelt in the town of Sincere. 
The thing was this. At the entering in at this passage, there comes down from 
Broadway-gate, a lane, called Dead-Man’s lane; so called because of the murders 
that are commonly done there; and this Little-Faith going on pilgrimage, as we 
do now, chanced to sit down there and sleep. Now there happened at that time to 
come down the lane from Broadway-gate, three sturdy rogues, and their names were 
Faint-Heart, Mistrust, and Guilt, three brothers; and they, espying Little-Faith 
where he was, came galloping up with speed. Now the good man was just awaked 
from his sleep, and was getting up to go on his journey. So they came up all to 
him, and with threatening language bid him stand. At this, Little-Faith looked 
as white as a sheet, and had neither power to fight nor fly. Then said 
Faint-Heart, Deliver thy purse; but he making no haste to do it, (for he was 
loth to lose his money,) Mistrust ran up to him, and thrusting his hand into his 
pocket, pulled out thence a bag of silver. Then he cried out, Thieves, thieves! 
With that, Guilt, with a great club that was in his hand, struck Little-Faith on 
the head, and with that blow felled him flat to the ground, where he lay 
bleeding as one that would bleed to death. All this while the thieves stood by. 
But at last, they hearing that some were upon the road, and fearing lest it 
should be one Great-Grace, that dwells in the town of Good-Confidence, they 
betook themselves to their heels, and left this good man to shift for himself. 
Now, after a while, Little-Faith came to himself, and getting up, made shift to 
scramble on his way. This was the story.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p13><SPAN id=v.ix-p13.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> But did they take from him all 
that ever he had?</P>
<P id=v.ix-p14><SPAN id=v.ix-p14.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> No; the place where his 
jewels were they never ransacked; so those he kept still. But, as I was told, 
the good man was much afflicted for his loss; for the thieves got most of his 
spending-money. That which they got not, as I said, were jewels; also, he had a 
little odd money left, but scarce enough to bring him to his journey’s end. Nay, 
(if I was not misinformed,) he was forced to beg as he went, to keep himself 
alive, for his jewels he might not sell; but beg and do what he could, he went, 
as we say, with many a hungry belly the most part of the rest of the way.

great part of the rest of his journey; and besides, when at any time it came 
into his mind, and he began to be comforted therewith, then would fresh thoughts

Would it not have been so to any of us, had we been used as he, to be robbed and

die with grief, poor heart. I was told that he scattered almost all the rest of 
the way with nothing but doleful and bitter complaints; telling, also, to all 
that overtook him, or that he overtook in the way as he went, where he was 
robbed, and how; who they were that did it, and what he had lost; how he was 
wounded, and that he hardly escaped with life.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p21><SPAN id=v.ix-p21.1

whom should he sell them? In all that country where he was robbed, his jewels 
were not accounted of; nor did he want that relief which could from thence be 
administered to him. Besides, had his jewels been missing at the gate of the 
Celestial City, he had (and that he knew well enough) been excluded from an 
inheritance there, and that would have been worse to him than the appearance and

<P id=v.ix-p23><SPAN id=v.ix-p23.1

indeed, and so do many besides, and by so doing exclude themselves from the 
chief blessing, as also that caitiff did; but you must put a difference betwixt 
Esau and Little-Faith, and also betwixt their estates. Esau’s birthright was 
typical; but Little-Faith’s jewels were not so. Esau’s belly was his god; but 
Little-Faith’s belly was not so. Esau’s want lay in his fleshy appetite; 
Little-Faith’s did not so. Besides, Esau could see no further than to the 
fulfilling of his lusts: For I am at the point to die, said he: and what good 
will this birthright do me? <SCRIPREF id=v.ix-p24.2 osisRef="Bible:Gen.25.32"

Little-Faith, though it was his lot to have but a little faith, was by his 
little faith kept from such extravagances, and made to see and prize his jewels 
more than to sell them, as Esau did his birthright. You read not any where that 
Esau had faith, no, not so much as a little; therefore no marvel, where the 
flesh only bears sway, (as it will in that man where no faith is to resist,) if 
he sells his birthright and his soul and all, and that to the devil of hell; for 
it is with such as it is with the ass, who in her occasion cannot be turned

passage="Jer 2:24">Jer. 2:24</SCRIPREF>: when their minds are set upon their 
lusts, they will have them, whatever they cost. But Little-Faith was of another 
temper; his mind was on things divine; his livelihood was upon things that were 
spiritual, and from above: therefore, to what end should he that is of such a 
temper sell his jewels (had there been any that would have bought them) to fill 
his mind with empty things? Will a man give a penny to fill his belly with hay? 
or can you persuade the turtle-dove to live upon carrion, like the crow? Though 
faithless ones can, for carnal lusts, pawn, or mortgage, or sell what they have, 
and themselves outright to boot; yet they that have faith, saving faith, though 
but a little of it, cannot do so. Here, therefore, my brother, is thy 
mistake.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p25><SPAN id=v.ix-p25.1

fellows, I am persuaded in my heart, are but a company of cowards: would they 
have run else, think you, as they did, at the noise of one that was coming on 
the road? Why did not Little-Faith pluck up a greater heart? He might, methinks, 
have stood one brush with them, and have yielded when there had been no

this is the height of thy stomach now they are at a distance from us, should 
they appear to thee as they did to him, they might put thee to second

<P id=v.ix-p29>But consider again, that they are but journeymen thieves; They

champions; nor can they, when tried, do such feats of war as he. Is it meet to 
think that a little child should handle Goliath as David did? or that there 
should be the strength of an ox in a wren? Some are strong, some are weak; some 
have great faith, some have little: this man was one of the weak, and therefore

sword’s point, do well enough with them; yet if they get within him, even 
Faint-Heart, Mistrust, or the other, it shall go hard but they will throw up his 
heels. And when a man is down, you know, what can he do?</P>
<P id=v.ix-p34>Whoso looks well upon Great-Grace’s face, will see those scars 
and cuts there that shall easily give demonstration of what I say. Yea, once I 
heard that he should say, (and that when he was in the combat,) We despaired 
even of life. How did these sturdy rogues and their fellows make David groan, 
mourn, and roar! Yea, Heman, <SCRIPREF id=v.ix-p34.1 osisRef="Bible:Ps.88.1"

<P id=v.ix-p35>Besides, their king is at their whistle; he is never out of

hold; the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. He esteemeth iron as straw, and

can a man do in this case? It is true, if a man could at every turn have Job’s

his neck is clothed with thunder. He will not be afraid as a grasshopper: the 
glory of his nostrils is terrible. He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his 
strength; he goeth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear, and is not 
affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. The quiver rattleth against 
him, the glittering spear and the shield. He swalloweth the ground with 
fierceness and rage; neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. 
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the 
thunder of the captains, and the shoutings.” <SCRIPREF id=v.ix-p35.2

<P id=v.ix-p36>But for such footmen as thee and I are, let us never desire to 
meet with an enemy, nor vaunt as if we could do better, when we hear of others 
that have been foiled, nor be tickled at the thoughts of our own manhood; for 
such commonly come by the worst when tried. Witness Peter, of whom I made 
mention before: he would swagger, aye, he would; he would, as his vain mind 
prompted him to say, do better and stand more for his Master than all men: but 
who so foiled and run down by those villains as he?</P>
<P id=v.ix-p37>When, therefore, we hear that such robberies are done on the 
King’s highway, two things become us to do.</P>
<P id=v.ix-p38>1. To go out harnessed, and be sure to take a shield with us: for 
it was for want of that, that he who laid so lustily at Leviathan could not make 
him yield; for, indeed, if that be wanting, he fears us not at all. Therefore, 
he that had skill hath said, “Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith ye 
shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.” <SCRIPREF

<P id=v.ix-p39>2. It is good, also, that we desire of the King a convoy, yea, 
that he will go with us himself. This made David rejoice when in the Valley of 
the Shadow of Death; and Moses was rather for dying where he stood, than to go 
one step without his God. <SCRIPREF id=v.ix-p39.1 osisRef="Bible:Exod.33.15"

<P id=v.ix-p41>I, for my part, have been in the fray before now; and though 
(through the goodness of Him that is best) I am, as you see, alive, yet I cannot 
boast of any manhood. Glad shall I be if I meet with no more such brunts; though 
I fear we are not got beyond all danger. However, since the lion and the bear 
have not as yet devoured me, I hope God will also deliver us from the next 
uncircumcised Philistine. Then sang Christian,</P><SPAN

<P id=v.ix-p42>So they went on, and Ignorance followed. They went then till they 
came at a place where they saw a way put itself into their way, and seemed 
withal to lie as strait as the way which they should go; and here they knew not 
which of the two to take, for both seemed strait before them: therefore here 
they stood still to consider. And as they were thinking about the way, behold a 
man black of flesh, but covered with a very light robe, come to them, and asked 
them why they stood there. They answered, they were going to the Celestial City, 
but knew not which of these ways to take. “Follow me,” said the man, “it is 
thither that I am going.” So they followed him in the way that but now came into 
the road, which by degrees turned, and turned them so far from the city that 
they desired to go to, that in a little time their faces were turned away from 
it; yet they follow him. But by and by, before they were aware, he led them both 
within the compass of a net, in which they were both so entangled that they knew 
not what to do; and with that the white robe fell off the black man’s back. Then 
they saw where they were. Wherefore there they lay crying some time, for they 
could not get themselves out.</P>

the net. At last they espied a Shining One coming towards them with a whip of 
small cords in his hand. When he was come to the place where they were, he asked 
them whence they came, and what they did there. They told him that they were 
poor pilgrims going to Zion, but were led out of their way by a black man 
clothed in white, who bid us, said they, follow him, for he was going thither

them, Follow me, that I may set you in your way again. So he led them back to 
the way which they had left to follow the Flatterer. Then he asked them, saying, 
Where did you lie the last night? They said, With the shepherds upon the 
Delectable Mountains. He asked them then if they had not of the shepherds a note 
of direction for the way. They answered, Yes. But did you not, said he, when you 
were at a stand, pluck out and read your note? They answered, No. He asked them, 
Why? They said they forgot. He asked, moreover, if the shepherds did not bid 
them beware of the Flatterer. They answered, Yes; but we did not imagine, said 
they, that this fine-spoken man had been he. <SCRIPREF id=v.ix-p44.5

thanked him for all his kindness, and went softly along the right way, 
singing,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

I began to reason with myself thus: If all my righteousnesses are as filthy 
rags; if by the deeds of the law no man can be justified; and if, when we have 
done all, we are yet unprofitable, then is it but a folly to think of heaven by 
the law. I farther thought thus: If a man runs a hundred pounds into the 
shopkeeper’s debt, and after that shall pay for all that he shall fetch; yet if 
his old debt stands still in the book uncrossed, the shopkeeper may sue him for 
it, and cast him into prison, till he shall pay the debt.</P>

man is only evil, and that continually.” <SCRIPREF id=v.ix-p169.2

thee under wrath in the day of God Almighty: for true justifying faith puts the 
soul, as sensible of its lost condition by the law, upon flying for refuge unto 
Christ’s righteousness; (which righteousness of his is not an act of grace by 
which he maketh, for justification, thy obedience accepted with God, but his 
personal obedience to the law, in doing and suffering for us what that required 
at our hands;) this righteousness, I say, true faith accepteth; under the skirt 
of which the soul being shrouded, and by it presented as spotless before God, it 
is accepted, and acquitted from condemnation.</P>

<P id=v.x-p14>2. It driveth the soul to lay fast hold of Christ for

<P id=v.x-p15>3. It begetteth and continueth in the soul a great reverence of

that with many tears. Truly I pitied the man, and was not altogether without

<P id=v.x-p30><SPAN id=v.x-p30.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> He told me once that he was 
resolved to go on pilgrimage, as we go now; but all of a sudden he grew 
acquainted with one Save-self, and then he became a stranger to me.</P>
<P id=v.x-p31><SPAN id=v.x-p31.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> Now, since we are talking about 
him, let us a little inquire into the reason of the sudden backsliding of him 
and such others.</P>
<P id=v.x-p32><SPAN id=v.x-p32.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> It may be very profitable; 
but do you begin.</P>
<P id=v.x-p33><SPAN id=v.x-p33.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">HOPEFUL:</SPAN> Well, then, there are, in my 
judgment, four reasons for it:</P>
<P id=v.x-p34>1. Though the consciences of such men are awakened, yet their 
minds are not changed: therefore, when the power of guilt weareth away, that 
which provoked them to be religious ceaseth; wherefore they naturally turn to 
their own course again; even as we see the dog that is sick of what he hath 
eaten, so long as his sickness prevails, he vomits and casts up all; not that he 
doth this of a free mind, (if we may say a dog has a mind,) but because it 
troubleth his stomach: but now, when his sickness is over, and so his stomach 
eased, his desires being not at all alienated from his vomit, he turns him 
about, and licks up all; and so it is true which is written, “The dog is turned 
to his own vomit again.” <SCRIPREF id=v.x-p34.1 osisRef="Bible:2Pet.2.22" 
parsed="|2Pet|2|22|0|0" passage="2 Pe 2:22">2 Pet. 2:22</SCRIPREF>. Thus, I say, 
being hot for heaven, by virtue only of the sense and fear of the torments of 
hell, as their sense and fear of damnation chills and cools, so their desires 
for heaven and salvation cool also. So then it comes to pass, that when their 
guilt and fear is gone, their desires for heaven and happiness die, and they 
return to their course again.</P>
<P id=v.x-p35>2. Another reason is, they have slavish fears that do overmaster 
them: I speak now of the fears that they have of men; “For the fear of man 
bringeth a snare.” <SCRIPREF id=v.x-p35.1 osisRef="Bible:Prov.29.25" 
parsed="|Prov|29|25|0|0" passage="Pr 29:25">Prov. 29:25</SCRIPREF>. So then, 
though they seem to be hot for heaven so long as the flames of hell are about 
their ears, yet, when that terror is a little over, they betake themselves to 
second thoughts, namely, that it is good to be wise and not to run (for they 
know not what) the hazard of losing all, or at least of bringing themselves into 
unavoidable and unnecessary troubles; and so they fall in with the world 
again.</P>
<P id=v.x-p36>3. The shame that attends religion lies also as a block in their 
way: they are proud and haughty, and religion in their eye is low and 
contemptible: therefore when they have lost their sense of hell and the wrath to 
come, they return again to their former course.</P>
<P id=v.x-p37>4. Guilt, and to meditate terror, are grievous to them; they like 
not to see their misery before they come into it; though perhaps the sight of at 
it first, if they loved that sight, might make them fly whither the righteous 
fly and are safe; but because they do, as I hinted before, even shun the 
thoughts of guilt and terror, therefore, when once they are rid of their 
awakenings about the terrors and wrath of God, they harden their hearts gladly, 
and choose such ways as will harden them more and more.</P>
<P id=v.x-p38><SPAN id=v.x-p38.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIAN:</SPAN> You are pretty near the 
business, for the bottom of all is for want of a change in their mind and will. 
And therefore they are but like the felon that standeth before the judge: he 
quakes and trembles, and seems to repent most heartily, but the bottom of all is 
the fear of the halter: not that he hath any detestation of the offence, as it 
is evident; because, let but this man have his liberty, and he will be a thief,

<P id=v.x-p41>1. They draw off their thoughts, all that they may, from the 
remembrance of God, death, and judgment to come.</P>
<P id=v.x-p42>2. Then they cast off by degrees private duties, as closet prayer, 
curbing their lusts, watching, sorrow for sin, and the like.</P>
<P id=v.x-p43>3. Then they shun the company of lively and warm Christians.</P>
<P id=v.x-p44>4. After that, they grow cold to public duty, as hearing, reading, 
godly conference, and the like.</P>
<P id=v.x-p45>5. They then begin to pick holes, as we say, in the coats of some 
of the godly, and that devilishly, that they may have a seeming color to throw 
religion (for the sake of some infirmities they have espied in them) behind 
their backs.</P>
<P id=v.x-p46>6. Then they begin to adhere to, and associate themselves with, 
carnal, loose, and wanton men.</P>
<P id=v.x-p47>7. Then they give way to carnal and wanton discourses in secret; 
and glad are they if they can see such things in any that are counted honest, 
that they may the more boldly do it through their example.</P>
<P id=v.x-p48>8. After this they begin to play with little sins openly.</P>
<P id=v.x-p49>9. And then, being hardened, they show themselves as they are. 
Thus, being launched again into the gulf of misery, unless a miracle of grace 
prevent it, they everlastingly perish in their own deceivings.</P>
<P id=v.x-p50>Now I saw in my dream, that by this time the pilgrims were got 
over the Enchanted Ground, and entering into the country of Beulah, whose air 
was very sweet and pleasant, <SCRIPREF id=v.x-p50.1 
osisRef="Bible:Isa.62.4-Isa.62.12" parsed="|Isa|62|4|62|12" 
passage="Isa 62:4-12">Isaiah 62:4-12</SCRIPREF>; <SCRIPREF id=v.x-p50.2 
osisRef="Bible:Song.2.10-Song.2.12" parsed="|Song|2|10|2|12" 
passage="SS 2:10-12">Song 2:10-12</SCRIPREF>; the way lying directly through it, 
they solaced themselves there for a season. Yea, here they heard continually the 
singing of birds, and saw every day the flowers appear in the earth, and heard 
the voice of the turtle in the land. In this country the sun shineth night and 
day: wherefore this was beyond the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and also out 
of the reach of Giant Despair; neither could they from this place so much as see 
Doubting Castle. Here they were within sight of the city they were going to; 
also here met them some of the inhabitants thereof; for in this land the shining 
ones commonly walked, because it was upon the borders of heaven. In this land 
also the contract between the Bride and the Bridegroom was renewed; yea, here, 
“as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so doth God rejoice over them.” 
Here they had no want of corn and wine; for in this place they met with 
abundance of what they had sought for in all their pilgrimage. Here they heard 
voices from out of the city, loud voices, saying, “Say ye to the daughter of 
Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh! Behold, his reward is with him!” Here all 
the inhabitants of the country called them “the holy People, the redeemed of the 
Lord, sought out,” etc.</P>
<P id=v.x-p51>Now, as they walked in this land, they had more rejoicing than in 
parts more remote from the kingdom to which they were bound; and drawing near to 
the city, they had yet a more perfect view thereof: It was builded of pearls and 
precious stones, also the streets thereof were paved with gold; so that, by 
reason of the natural glory of the city, and the reflection of the sunbeams upon 
it, Christian with desire fell sick; Hopeful also had a fit or two of the same 
disease: wherefore here they lay by it a while, crying out because of their 
pangs, “If you see my Beloved, tell him that I am sick of love.”</P>
<P id=v.x-p52>But, being a little strengthened, and better able to bear their 
sickness, they walked on their way, and came yet nearer and nearer, where were 
orchards, vineyards, and gardens, and their gates opened into the highway. Now, 
as they came up to these places, behold the gardener stood in the way; to whom 
the pilgrims said, Whose goodly vineyards and gardens are these? He answered, 
they are the King’s, and are planted here for his own delight, and also for the 
solace of pilgrims. So the gardener had them into the vineyards, and bid them 
refresh themselves with the dainties, <SCRIPREF id=v.x-p52.1 
osisRef="Bible:Deut.23.24" parsed="|Deut|23|24|0|0" passage="Dt 23:24">Deut. 
23:24</SCRIPREF>; he also showed them there the King’s walks and arbors where he 
delighted to be: And here they tarried and slept.</P>
<P id=v.x-p53>Now I beheld in my dream, that they talked more in their sleep at 
this time than ever they did in all their journey; and, being in a muse 
thereabout, the gardener said even to me, Wherefore musest thou at the matter? 
It is the nature of the fruit of the grapes of these vineyards, “to go down so 
sweetly as to cause the lips of them that are asleep to speak.” <SCRIPREF 
id=v.x-p53.1 osisRef="Bible:Song.7.9" parsed="|Song|7|9|0|0" 
passage="SS 7:9">Song 7:9</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.x-p54>So I saw that when they awoke, they addressed themselves to go up 
to the city. But, as I said, the reflection of the sun upon the city (for the 
city was pure gold, <SCRIPREF id=v.x-p54.1 osisRef="Bible:Rev.21.18" 
parsed="|Rev|21|18|0|0" passage="Rev 21:18">Rev. 21:18</SCRIPREF>,) was so 
extremely glorious, that they could not as yet with open face behold it, but 
through an instrument made for that purpose. <SCRIPREF id=v.x-p54.2 
osisRef="Bible:2Cor.3.18" parsed="|2Cor|3|18|0|0" passage="2 Co 3:18">2 Cor. 
3:18</SCRIPREF>. So I saw, that as they went on, there met them two men in 
raiment that shone like gold, also their faces shone as the light.</P>
<P id=v.x-p55>These men asked the pilgrims whence they came; and they told them. 
They also asked them where they had lodged, what difficulties and dangers, what 
comforts and pleasures, they had met with in the way; and they told them. Then 
said the men that met them, You have but two difficulties more to meet with, and 
then you are in the City.</P>
<P id=v.x-p56>Christian then and his companion asked the men to go along with 
them: so they told them that they would; But, said they, you must obtain it by 
your own faith. So I saw in my dream, that they went on together till they came 
in sight of the gate.</P>
<P id=v.x-p57>Now I further saw, that betwixt them and the gate was a river; but 
there was no bridge to go over, and the river was very deep. At the sight, 
therefore, of this river the pilgrims were much stunned; but the men that went 
with them said, You must go through, or you cannot come at the gate.</P>
<P id=v.x-p58>The pilgrims then began to inquire if there was no other way to 
the gate. To which they answered, Yes; but there hath not any, save two, to wit, 
Enoch and Elijah, been permitted to tread that path since the foundation of the 
world, nor shall until the last trumpet shall sound. The pilgrims then, 
especially Christian, began to despond in their mind, and looked this way and 
that, but no way could be found by them by which they might escape the river. 
Then they asked the men if the waters were all of a depth. They said, No; yet 
they could not help them in that case; for, said they, you shall find it deeper 
or shallower as you believe in the King of the place.</P>
<P id=v.x-p59>Then they addressed themselves to the water, and entering, 
Christian began to sink, and crying out to his good friend Hopeful, he said, I 
sink in deep waters; the billows go over my head; all his waves go over me. 
Selah.</P>
<P id=v.x-p60>Then said the other, Be of good cheer, my brother: I feel the 
bottom, and it is good. Then said Christian, Ah! my friend, the sorrows of death 
have compassed me about, I shall not see the land that flows with milk and 
honey. And with that a great darkness and horror fell upon Christian, so that he 
could not see before him. Also here he in a great measure lost his senses, so 
that he could neither remember nor orderly talk of any of those sweet 
refreshments that he had met with in the way of his pilgrimage. But all the 
words that he spoke still tended to discover that he had horror of mind, and 
heart-fears that he should die in that river, and never obtain entrance in at 
the gate. Here also, as they that stood by perceived, he was much in the 
troublesome thoughts of the sins that he had committed, both since and before he 
began to be a pilgrim. It was also observed that he was troubled with 
apparitions of hobgoblins and evil spirits; for ever and anon he would intimate 
so much by words.</P>
<P id=v.x-p61>Hopeful therefore here had much ado to keep his brother’s head 
above water; yea, sometimes he would be quite gone down, and then, ere a while, 
he would rise up again half dead. Hopeful did also endeavor to comfort him, 
saying, Brother, I see the gate, and men standing by to receive us; but 
Christian would answer, It is you, it is you they wait for; for you have been 
hopeful ever since I knew you. And so have you, said he to Christian. Ah, 
brother, (said he,) surely if I was right he would now arise to help me; but for 
my sins he hath brought me into the snare, and hath left me. Then said Hopeful, 
My brother, you have quite forgot the text where it is said of the wicked, 
“There are no bands in their death, but their strength is firm; they are not 
troubled as other men, neither are they plagued like other men.” <SCRIPREF

parsed="|Ps|73|4|0|0;|Ps|73|5|0|0" passage="Ps 73:4,5">Psa. 73:4,5</SCRIPREF>. 
These troubles and distresses that you go through in these waters, are no sign 
that God hath forsaken you; but are sent to try you, whether you will call to 
mind that which heretofore you have received of his goodness, and live upon him 
in your distresses.</P>
<P id=v.x-p62>Then I saw in my dream, that Christian was in a muse a while. To 
whom also Hopeful added these words, Be of good cheer, Jesus Christ maketh thee 
whole. And with that Christian brake out with a loud voice, Oh, I see him again; 
and he tells me, “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and 
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.” <SCRIPREF id=v.x-p62.1 
osisRef="Bible:Isa.43.2" parsed="|Isa|43|2|0|0" passage="Isa 43:2">Isa. 
43:2</SCRIPREF>. Then they both took courage, and the enemy was after that as 
still as a stone, until they were gone over. Christian, therefore, presently 
found ground to stand upon, and so it followed that the rest of the river was 
but shallow. Thus they got over.</P>
<P id=v.x-p63>Now, upon the bank of the river, on the other side, they saw the 
two shining men again, who there waited for them. Wherefore, being come out of 
the river, they saluted them, saying, We are ministering spirits, sent forth to 
minister for those that shall be the heirs of salvation. Thus they went along 
towards the gate.</P>
<P id=v.x-p64>Now you must note, that the city stood upon a mighty hill; but the 
pilgrims went up that hill with ease, because they had these two men to lead 
them up by the arms: they had likewise left their mortal garments behind them in 
the river; for though they went in with them, they came out without them. They 
therefore went up here with much agility and speed, though the foundation upon 
which the city was framed was higher than the clouds; they therefore went up 
through the region of the air, sweetly talking as they went, being comforted 
because they safely got over the river, and had such glorious companions to 
attend them.</P>
<P id=v.x-p65>The talk that they had with the shining ones was about the glory 
of the place; who told them that the beauty and glory of it was inexpressible. 
There, said they, is “Mount Sion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the innumerable 
company of angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect.” <SCRIPREF

<P id=v.x-p66>Now, while they were thus drawing towards the gate, behold a 
company of the heavenly host came out to meet them: to whom it was said by the 
other two shining ones, These are the men that have loved our Lord when they 
were in the world, and that have left all for his holy name; and he hath sent us 
to fetch them, and we have brought them thus far on their desired journey, that 
they may go in and look their Redeemer in the face with joy. Then the heavenly 
host gave a great shout, saying, “Blessed are they that are called to the 
marriage-supper of the Lamb.” <SCRIPREF id=v.x-p66.1 osisRef="Bible:Rev.19.9" 
parsed="|Rev|19|9|0|0" passage="Rev 19:9">Rev. 19:9</SCRIPREF>. There came out 
also at this time to meet them several of the King’s trumpeters, clothed in 
white and shining raiment, who, with melodious noises and loud, made even the 
heavens to echo with their sound. These trumpeters saluted Christian and his 
fellow with ten thousand welcomes from the world; and this they did with 
shouting and sound of trumpet.</P>
<P id=v.x-p67>This done, they compassed them round on every side; some went 
before, some behind, and some on the right hand, and some on the left, (as it 
were to guard them through the upper regions,) continually sounding as they 
went, with melodious noise, in notes on high; so that the very sight was to them 
that could behold it as if heaven itself was come down to meet them. Thus, 
therefore, they walked on together; and, as they walked, ever and anon these 
trumpeters, even with joyful sound, would, by mixing their music with looks and 
gestures, still signify to Christian and his brother how welcome they were into 
their company, and with what gladness they came to meet them. And now were these 
two men, as it were, in heaven, before they came to it, being swallowed up with 
the sight of angels, and with hearing of their melodious notes. Here also they 
had the city itself in view; and they thought they heard all the bells therein 
to ring, to welcome them thereto. But, above all, the warm and joyful thoughts 
that they had about their own dwelling there with such company, and that for 
ever and ever; oh, by what tongue or pen can their glorious joy be expressed! 
Thus they came up to the gate.</P>
<P id=v.x-p68>Now when they were come up to the gate, there was written over it, 
in letters of gold,</P>
<P id=v.x-p69>“blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have 
right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the 
city.”</P>
<P id=v.x-p70>Then I saw in my dream, that the shining men bid them call at the 
gate: the which when they did, some from above looked over the gate, to wit, 
Enoch, Moses, and Elijah, etc., to whom it was said, These pilgrims are come 
from the City of Destruction, for the love that they bear to the King of this 
place; and then the pilgrims gave in unto them each man his certificate, which 
they had received in the beginning: those therefore were carried in unto the 
King, who, when he had read them, said, Where are the men? To whom it was 
answered, They are standing without the gate. The King then commanded to open 
the gate, “That the righteous nation (said he) that keepeth the truth may enter 
in.”</P>

parsed="|Isa|26|2|0|0" passage="Isa 26:2">Isa. 26:2</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=v.x-p72>Now I saw in my dream, that these two men went in at the gate; and 
lo, as they entered, they were transfigured; and they had raiment put on that 
shone like gold. There were also that met them with harps and crowns, and gave 
them to them; the harps to praise withal, and the crowns in token of honor. Then 
I heard in my dream, that all the bells in the city rang again for joy, and that 
it was said unto them,</P>
<P id=v.x-p73>“enter ye into the joy of your lord.”</P>
<P id=v.x-p74>I also heard the men themselves, that they sang with a loud voice, 
saying,</P>
<P id=v.x-p75>“blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that 
sitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb, for ever and ever.”</P>
<P id=v.x-p76>Now, just as the gates were opened to let in the men, I looked in 
after them, and behold the city shone like the sun; the streets also were paved 
with gold; and in them walked many men, with crowns on their heads, palms in 
their hands, and golden harps, to sing praises withal.</P>
<P id=v.x-p77>There were also of them that had wings, and they answered one 
another without intermission, saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord. And after 
that they shut up the gates; which, when I had seen, I wished myself among 
them.</P>
<P id=v.x-p78>Now, while I was gazing upon all these things, I turned my head to 
look back, and saw Ignorance come up to the river side; but he soon got over, 
and that without half the difficulty which the other two men met with. For it 
happened that there was then in that place one Vain-Hope, a ferryman, that with 
his boat helped him over; so he, as the other I saw, did ascend the hill, to 
come up to the gate; only he came alone, neither did any man meet him with the 
least encouragement. When he was come up to the gate, he looked up to the 
writing that was above, and then began to knock, supposing that entrance should 
have been quickly administered to him; but he was asked by the men that looked 
over the top of the gate, Whence come you? and what would you have? He answered, 
I have ate and drank in the presence of the King, and he has taught in our 
streets. Then they asked him for his certificate, that they might go in and show 
it to the King: so he fumbled in his bosom for one, and found none. Then said 
they, Have you none? but the man answered never a word. So they told the King, 
but he would not come down to see him, but commanded the two shining ones, that 
conducted Christian and Hopeful to the city, to go out and take Ignorance, and 
bind him hand and foot, and have him away. Then they took him up, and carried 
him through the air to the door that I saw in the side of the hill, and put him 
in there. Then I saw that there was a way to hell, even from the gate of heaven, 
as well as from the City of Destruction. So I awoke, and behold it was a 
dream.</P>

<H3 class=s02 id=vi.i-p1.296>Is the hearty prayer of <BR>The Author, <BR>JOHN 
BUNYAN.</H3>
<P class=div2>TO THE READER</P>
<P id=i_1-p1><SPAN id=i_1-p1.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">courteous 
companions,</SPAN></P>
<P id=i_1-p2>Some time since, to tell you my dream that I had of Christian the 
pilgrim, and of his dangerous journey towards the Celestial country, was 
pleasant to me and profitable to you. I told you then also what I saw concerning 
his wife and children, and how unwilling they were to go with him on pilgrimage; 
insomuch that he was forced to go on his progress without them; for he durst not 
run the danger of that destruction which he feared would come by staying with 
them in the City of Destruction: wherefore, as I then showed you, he left them 
and departed.</P>
<P id=i_1-p3>Now it hath so happened, through the multiplicity of business, that 
I have been much hindered and kept back from my wonted travels into those parts 
whence he went, and so could not, till now, obtain an opportunity to make 
further inquiry after those whom he left behind, that I might give you an 
account of them. But having had some concerns that way of late, I went down 
again thitherward. Now, having taken up my lodging in a wood about a mile off 
the place, as I slept, I dreamed again.</P>
<P id=i_1-p4>And as I was in my dream, behold, an aged gentleman came by where I 
lay; and, because he was to go some part of the way that I was traveling, 
methought I got up and went with him. So, as we walked, and as travelers usually 
do, I was as if we fell into a discourse; and our talk happened to be about 
Christian and his travels; for thus I began with the old man:</P>
<P id=i_1-p5>Sir, said I, what town is that there below, that lieth on the left 
hand of our way?</P>
<P id=i_1-p6>Then said Mr. Sagacity, (for that was his name,) It is the City of 
Destruction, a populous place, but possessed with a very ill-conditioned and 
idle sort of people.</P>
<P id=i_1-p7>I thought that was that city, quoth I; I went once myself through 
that town; and therefore know that this report you give of it is true.</P>
<P id=i_1-p8><SPAN id=i_1-p8.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
SAGACITY:</SPAN> Too true! I wish I could speak truth in speaking better of them 
that dwell therein.</P>
<P id=i_1-p9>Well, sir, quoth I, then I perceive you to be a well-meaning man, 
and so one that takes pleasure to hear and tell of that which is good. Pray, did 
you never hear what happened to a man some time ago of this town, (whose name 
was Christian,) that went on a pilgrimage up towards the higher regions?</P>
<P id=i_1-p10><SPAN id=i_1-p10.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
SAGACITY:</SPAN> Hear of him! Aye, and I also heard of the molestations, 
troubles, wars, captivities, cries, groans, frights, and fears, that he met with 
and had on his journey. Besides, I must tell you, all our country rings of him; 
there are but few houses that have heard of him and his doings, but have sought 
after and got the records of his pilgrimage; yea, I think I may say that his 
hazardous journey has got many well-wishers to his ways; for, though when he was 
here he was fool in every man’s mouth, yet now he is gone he is highly commended 
of all. For ‘tis said he lives bravely where he is: yea, many of them that are 
resolved never to run his hazards, yet have their mouths water at his gains.</P>
<P id=i_1-p11>They may, quoth I, well think, if they think any thing that is 
true, that he liveth well where he is; for he now lives at, and in the fountain 
of life, and has what he has without labor and sorrow, for there is no grief 
mixed therewith. But, pray what talk have the people about him?</P>
<P id=i_1-p12><SPAN id=i_1-p12.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
SAGACITY:</SPAN> Talk! the people talk strangely about him: some say that he now 
walks in white, <SCRIPREF id=i_1-p12.2 osisRef="Bible:Rev.3.4" 
parsed="|Rev|3|4|0|0" passage="Rev 3:4">Rev. 3:4</SCRIPREF>; that he has a chain 
of gold about his neck; that he has a crown of gold, beset with pearls, upon his 
head: others say, that the shining ones, who sometimes showed themselves to him 
in his journey, are become his companions, and that he is as familiar with them 
where he is, as here one neighbor is with another. Besides, it is confidently 
affirmed concerning him, that the King of the place where he is has bestowed 
upon him already a very rich and pleasant dwelling at court, and that he every 
day eateth and drinketh, and walketh and talketh with him, and receiveth of the 
smiles and favors of him that is Judge of all there. <SCRIPREF id=i_1-p12.3

of that country, will shortly come into these parts, and will know the reason, 
if they can give any, why his neighbors set so little by him, and had him so 
much in derision, when they perceived that he would be a pilgrim. <SCRIPREF

<P id=i_1-p13>For they say, that now he is so in the affections of his Prince, 
that his Sovereign is so much concerned with the indignities that were cast upon 
Christian when he became a pilgrim, that he will look upon all as if done unto 
himself, <SCRIPREF id=i_1-p13.1 osisRef="Bible:Luke.10.16"

marvel, for it was for the love that he had to his Prince that he ventured as he 
did.</P>
<P id=i_1-p14>I dare say, quoth I; I am glad on’t; I am glad for the poor man’s 
sake, for that now he has rest from his labor, and for that he now reapeth the 
benefit of his tears with joy; and for that he has got beyond the gun-shot of 
his enemies, and is out of the reach of them that hate him. <SCRIPREF

these things is noised abroad in this country; who can tell but that it may work 
some good effect on some that are left behind? But pray, sir, while it is fresh 
in my mind, do you hear anything of his wife and children? Poor hearts! I wonder 
in my mind what they do.</P>
<P id=i_1-p15><SPAN id=i_1-p15.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

Christian did himself; for though they all played the fool at first, and would 
by no means be persuaded by either the tears or entreaties of Christian, yet 
second thoughts have wrought wonderfully with them: so they have packed up, and 
are also gone after him.</P>

affair.</P>
<P id=i_1-p18>Then, said I, a man, it seems, may report it for a truth.</P>
<P id=i_1-p19><SPAN id=i_1-p19.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
SAGACITY:</SPAN> You need not fear to affirm it: I mean, that they are all gone 
on pilgrimage, both the good woman and her four boys. And being we are, as I 
perceive, going some considerable way together, I will give you an account of 
the whole matter.</P>
<P id=i_1-p20>This Christiana, (for that was her name from the day that she with 
her children betook themselves to a pilgrim’s life,) after her husband was gone 
over the river, and she could hear of him no more, her thoughts began to work in 
her mind. First, for that she had lost her husband, and for that the loving bond 
of that relation was utterly broken betwixt them. For you know, said he to me, 
nature can do no less but entertain the living with many a heavy cogitation, in 
the remembrance of the loss of loving relations. This, therefore, of her husband 
did cost her many a tear. But this was not all; for Christiana did also begin to 
consider with herself, whether her unbecoming behavior towards her husband was 
not one cause that she saw him no more, and that in such sort he was taken away 
from her. And upon this came into her mind, by swarms, all her unkind, 
unnatural, and ungodly carriage to her dear friend; which also clogged her 
conscience, and did load her with guilt. She was, moreover, much broken with 
recalling to remembrance the restless groans, brinish tears, and self-bemoanings 
of her husband, and how she did harden her heart against all his entreaties and 
loving persuasions of her and her sons to go with him; yea, there was not any 
thing that Christian either said to her, or did before her, all the while that 
his burden did hang on his back, but it returned upon her like a flash of 
lightning, and rent the caul of her heart in sunder; especially that bitter 
outcry of his, “What shall I do to be saved?” did ring in her ears most 
dolefully.</P>
<P id=i_1-p21>Then said she to her children, Sons, we are all undone. I have 
sinned away your father, and he is gone: he would have had us with him, but I 
would not go myself: I also have hindered you of life. With that the boys fell 
into tears, and cried out to go after their father. Oh, said Christiana, that it 
had been but our lot to go with him! then had it fared well with us, beyond what 
it is like to do now. For, though I formerly foolishly imagined, concerning the 
troubles of your father, that they proceeded of a foolish fancy that he had, or 
for that he was overrun with melancholy humors; yet now it will not out of my 
mind, but that they sprang from another cause; to wit, for that the light of 
life was given him, <SCRIPREF id=i_1-p21.1 osisRef="Bible:Jas.1.23-Jas.1.25"

osisRef="Bible:Prov.14.27" parsed="|Prov|14|27|0|0" passage="Pr 14:27">Prov.

day!</P>
<P id=i_1-p22>The next night Christiana had a dream; and, behold, she saw as if 
a broad parchment was opened before her, in which were recorded the sum of her 
ways; and the crimes, as she thought looked very black upon her. Then she cried 
out aloud in her sleep, “Lord, have mercy upon me a sinner!” <SCRIPREF 
id=i_1-p22.1 osisRef="Bible:Luke.18.13" parsed="|Luke|18|13|0|0" 
passage="Lk 18:13">Luke 18:13</SCRIPREF>; and the little children heard her.</P>
<P id=i_1-p23>After this she thought she saw two very ill-favored ones standing 
by her bedside, and saying, What shall we do with this woman? for she cries out 
for mercy, waking and sleeping: if she be suffered to go on as she begins, we 
shall lose her as we have lost her husband. Wherefore we must, by one way or 
other, seek to take her off from the thoughts of what shall be hereafter, else 
all the world cannot help but she will become a pilgrim.</P>
<P id=i_1-p24>Now she awoke in a great sweat, also a trembling was upon her: but 
after a while she fell to sleeping again. And then she thought she saw 
Christian, her husband, in a place of bliss among many immortals, with a harp in 
his hand, standing and playing upon it before One that sat on a throne with a 
rainbow about his head. She saw also, as if he bowed his head with his face to 
the paved work that was under his Prince’s feet, saying, “I heartily thank my 
Lord and King for bringing me into this place.” Then shouted a company of them 
that stood round about, and harped with their harps; but no man living could 
tell what they said but Christian and his companions.</P>
<P id=i_1-p25>Next morning, when she was up, had prayed to God, and talked with 
her children a while, one knocked hard at the door; to whom she spake out, 
saying, “If thou comest in God’s name, come in.” So he said, “Amen;” and opened 
the door, and saluted her with, “Peace be to this house.” The which when he had 
done, he said, “Christiana, knowest thou wherefore I am come?” Then she blushed 
and trembled; also her heart began to wax warm with desires to know from whence 
he came, and what was his errand to her. So he said unto her, “My name is 
Secret; I dwell with those that are on high. It is talked of where I dwell as if 
thou hadst a desire to go thither: also there is a report that thou art</P>
<P id=i_1-p26>aware of the evil thou hast formerly done to thy husband, in 
hardening of thy heart against his way, and in keeping of these babes in their 
ignorance. Christiana, the Merciful One has sent me to tell thee, that he is a 
God ready to forgive, and that he taketh delight to multiply the pardon of 
offences. He also would have thee to know, that he inviteth thee to come into 
his presence, to his table, and that he will feed thee with the fat of his 
house, and with the heritage of Jacob thy father.</P>
<P id=i_1-p27>“There is Christian, thy husband that was, with legions more, his 
companions, ever beholding that face that doth minister life to beholders; and 
they will all be glad when they shall hear the sound of thy feet step over thy 
Father’s threshold.”</P>
<P id=i_1-p28>Christiana at this was greatly abashed in herself, and bowed her 
head to the ground. This visitor proceeded, and said, “Christiana, here is also 
a letter for thee, which I have brought from thy husband’s King.” So she took 
it, and opened it, but it smelt after the manner of the best perfume. <SCRIPREF 
id=i_1-p28.1 osisRef="Bible:Song.1.3" parsed="|Song|1|3|0|0" 
passage="SS 1:3">Song 1:3</SCRIPREF>. Also it was written in letters of gold. 
The contents of the letter were these, That the King would have her to do as did 
Christian her husband; for that was the way to come to his city, and to dwell in 
his presence with joy for ever. At this the good woman was quite overcome; so 
she cried out to her visitor, Sir, will you carry me and my children with you, 
that we also may go and worship the King?</P>
<P id=i_1-p29>Then said the visitor, Christiana, the bitter is before the sweet. 
Thou must through troubles, as did he that went before thee, enter this 
Celestial City. Wherefore I advise thee to do as did Christian thy husband: go 
to the Wicket-gate yonder, over the plain, for that stands at the head of the 
way up which thou must go; and I wish thee all good speed. Also I advise that 
thou put this letter in thy bosom, that thou read therein to thyself and to thy 
children until you have got it by heart; for it is one of the songs that thou 
must sing while thou art in this house of thy pilgrimage, <SCRIPREF id=i_1-p29.1 
osisRef="Bible:Ps.119.54" parsed="|Ps|119|54|0|0" passage="Ps 119:54">Psalm 
119:54</SCRIPREF>; also this thou must deliver in at the further gate.</P>
<P id=i_1-p30>Now I saw in my dream, that this old gentleman, as he told me the 
story, did himself seem to be greatly affected therewith. He moreover proceeded, 
and said, So Christiana called her sons together, and began thus to address 
herself unto them: “My sons, I have, as you may perceive, been of late under 
much exercise in my soul about the death of your father: not for that I doubt at 
all of his happiness, for I am satisfied now that he is well. I have also been 
much affected with the thoughts of my own state and yours, which I verily 
believe is by nature miserable. My carriage also to your father in his distress 
is a great load to my conscience; for I hardened both mine own heart and yours 
against him, and refused to go with him on pilgrimage.</P>
<P id=i_1-p31>The thoughts of these things would now kill me outright, but that 
for a dream which I had last night, and but that for the encouragement which 
this stranger has given me this morning. Come, my children, let us pack up, and 
begone to the gate that leads to the Celestial country, that we may see your 
father, and be with him and his companions in peace, according to the laws of 
that land.</P>
<P id=i_1-p32>Then did her children burst out into tears, for joy that the heart 
of their mother was so inclined. So their visitor bid them farewell; and they 
began to prepare to set out for their journey.</P>
<P id=i_1-p33>But while they were thus about to be gone, two of the women that 
were Christiana’s neighbors came up to her house, and knocked at her door. To 
whom she said as before, If you come in God’s name, come in. At this the women 
were stunned; for this kind of language they used not to hear, or to perceive to 
drop from the lips of Christiana. Yet they came in: but behold, they found the 
good woman preparing to be gone from her house.</P>
<P id=i_1-p34>So they began, and said, Neighbor, pray what is your meaning by 
this?</P>
<P id=i_1-p35>Christiana answered, and said to the eldest of them, whose name 
was Mrs. Timorous, I am preparing for a journey.</P>
<P id=i_1-p36>This Timorous was daughter to him that met Christian upon the Hill 
of Difficulty, and would have had him go back for fear of the lions.</P>
<P id=i_1-p37><SPAN id=i_1-p37.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TIMOROUS:</SPAN> For what journey, I pray 
you?</P>
<P id=i_1-p38><SPAN id=i_1-p38.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Even to go after my good 
husband. And with that she fell a weeping.</P>
<P id=i_1-p39><SPAN id=i_1-p39.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TIMOROUS:</SPAN> I hope not so, good neighbor; 
pray, for your poor children’s sake, do not so unwomanly cast away yourself.</P>
<P id=i_1-p40><SPAN id=i_1-p40.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Nay, my children shall go 
with me; not one of them is willing to stay behind.</P>
<P id=i_1-p41><SPAN id=i_1-p41.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TIMOROUS:</SPAN> I wonder in my very heart what 
or who has brought you into this mind!</P>
<P id=i_1-p42><SPAN id=i_1-p42.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> O neighbor, knew you but as 
much as I do, I doubt not but that you would go along with me.</P>
<P id=i_1-p43><SPAN id=i_1-p43.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TIMOROUS:</SPAN> Prithee, what new knowledge 
hast thou got, that so worketh off thy mind from thy friends, and that tempteth 
thee to go nobody knows where?</P>
<P id=i_1-p44><SPAN id=i_1-p44.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Then Christiana replied, I 
have been sorely afflicted since my husband’s departure from me; but especially 
since he went over the river. But that which troubleth me most is, my churlish 
carriage to him when he was under his distress. Besides, I am now as he was 
then; nothing will serve me but going on pilgrimage. I was a dreaming last night 
that I saw him. O that my soul was with him! He dwelleth in the presence of the 
King of the country; he sits and eats with him at his table; he is become a 
companion of immortals, and has a house now given him to dwell in, to which the 
best palace on earth, if compared, seems to me but a dunghill. <SCRIPREF 
id=i_1-p44.2 osisRef="Bible:2Cor.5.1-2Cor.5.4" parsed="|2Cor|5|1|5|4" 
passage="2 Co 5:1-4">2 Cor. 5:1-4</SCRIPREF>. The Prince of the place has also 
sent for me, with promise of entertainment, if I shall come to him; his 
messenger was here even now, and has brought me a letter, which invites me to 
come. And with that she plucked out her letter, and read it, and said to them, 
What now will you say to this?</P>
<P id=i_1-p45><SPAN id=i_1-p45.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TIMOROUS:</SPAN> Oh, the madness that has 
possessed thee and thy husband, to run yourselves upon such difficulties! You 
have heard, I am sure what your husband did meet with, even in a manner at the 
first step that he took on his way, as our neighbor Obstinate can yet testify, 
for he went along with him; yea, and Pliable too, until they, like wise men, 
were afraid to go any further. We also heard, over and above, how he met with 
the lions, Apollyon, the Shadow of Death, and many other things. Nor is the 
danger that he met with at Vanity Fair to be forgotten by thee. For if he, 
though a man, was so hard put to it, what canst thou, being but a poor woman, 
do? Consider also, that these four sweet babes are thy children, thy flesh and 
thy bones. Wherefore, though thou shouldest be so rash as to cast away thyself, 
yet, for the sake of the fruit of thy body, keep thou at home.</P>
<P id=i_1-p46>But Christiana said unto her, Tempt me not, my neighbor: I have 
now a price put into my hands to get gain, and I should be a fool of the 
greatest size if I should have no heart to strike in with the opportunity. And 
for that you tell me of all these troubles which I am like to meet with in the 
way, they are so far from being to me a discouragement, that they show I am in 
the right. The bitter must come before the sweet, and that also will make the 
sweet the sweeter. Wherefore, since you came not to my house in God’s name, as I 
said, I pray you to be gone, and not to disquiet me further.</P>
<P id=i_1-p47>Then Timorous reviled her, and said to her fellow, Come, neighbor 
Mercy, let us leave her in her own hands, since she scorns our counsel and 
company. But Mercy was at a stand, and could not so readily comply with her 
neighbor; and that for a two fold reason. 1. Her bowels yearned over Christiana. 
So she said within herself, if my neighbor will needs be gone, I will go a 
little way with her, and help her. 2. Her bowels yearned over her own soul; for 
what Christiana had said had taken some hold upon her mind. Wherefore she said 
within herself again, I will yet have more talk with this Christiana; and, if I 
find truth and life in what she shall say, I myself with my heart shall also go 
with her. Wherefore Mercy began thus to reply to her neighbor Timorous:</P>
<P id=i_1-p48><SPAN id=i_1-p48.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> 
Neighbor, I did indeed come with you to see Christiana this morning; and since 
she is, as you see, taking of her last farewell of the country, I think to walk 
this sunshiny morning a little with her, to help her on her way. But she told 
her not of her second reason, but kept it to herself.</P>
<P id=i_1-p49><SPAN id=i_1-p49.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TIMOROUS:</SPAN> Well, I see you have a mind to 
go a fooling too; but take heed in time, and be wise: while we are out of 
danger, we are out; but when we are in, we are in.</P>
<P id=i_1-p50>So Mrs. Timorous returned to her house, and Christiana betook 
herself to her journey. But when Timorous was got home to her house she sends 
for some of her neighbors, to wit, Mrs. Bat’s-Eyes, Mrs. Inconsiderate, Mrs. 
Light-Mind, and Mrs. Know-Nothing. So when they were come to her house, she 
falls to telling of the story of Christiana, and of her intended journey. And 
thus she began her tale:</P>
<P id=i_1-p51><SPAN id=i_1-p51.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TIMOROUS:</SPAN> Neighbors, having had little 
to do this morning, I went to give Christiana a visit; and when I came at the 
door I knocked, as you know it is our custom; and she answered, If you come in 
God’s name, come in. So in I went, thinking all was well; but, when I came in I 
found her preparing herself to depart the town, she, and also her children. So I 
asked her what was her meaning by that. And she told me, in short, that she was 
now of a mind to go on pilgrimage, as did her husband. She told me also of a 
dream that she had, and how the King of the country where her husband was, had 
sent an inviting letter to come thither.</P>
<P id=i_1-p52>Then said Mrs. Know-Nothing, And what, do you think she will 
go?</P>
<P id=i_1-p53><SPAN id=i_1-p53.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">TIMOROUS:</SPAN> Aye, go she will, whatever 
comes on’t; and methinks I know it by this; for that which was my great argument 
to persuade her to stay at home, (to wit, the troubles she was like to meet with 
on the way,) is one great argument with her to put her forward on her journey. 
For she told me in so many words, The bitter goes before the sweet; yea, and 
forasmuch as it doth, it makes the sweet the sweeter.</P>
<P id=i_1-p54><SPAN id=i_1-p54.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MRS. 
BAT’S-EYES:</SPAN> Oh, this blind and foolish woman! said she; and will she not 
take warning by her husband’s afflictions? For my part, I see, if he were here 
again, he would rest himself content in a whole skin, and never run so many 
hazards for nothing.</P>
<P id=i_1-p55>Mrs. Inconsiderate also replied, saying, Away with such 
fantastical fools from the town: a good riddance, for my part, I say, of her; 
should she stay where she dwells, and retain this her mind, who could live 
quietly by her? for she will either be dumpish, or unneighborly, or talk of such 
matters as no wise body can abide. Wherefore, for my part, I shall never be 
sorry for her departure; let her go, and let better come in her room: it was 
never a good world since these whimsical fools dwelt in it.</P>
<P id=i_1-p56>Then Mrs. Light-Mind added as followeth: Come, put this kind of 
talk away. I was yesterday at Madam Wanton’s, where we were as merry as the 
maids. For who do you think should be there but I and Mrs. Love-the-Flesh, and 
three or four more, with Mrs. Lechery, Mrs. Filth, and some others: so there we 
had music and dancing, and what else was meet to fill up the pleasure. And I 
dare say, my lady herself is an admirable well-bred gentlewoman, and Mr. Lechery 
is as pretty a fellow.</P>
<P class=div2>THE FIRST STAGE</P>
<H2 id=vi.ii-p0.1><A id=vi.ii-p0.2></A>THE FIRST STAGE</H2>
<P id=vi.ii-p1>By this time Christiana was got on her way, and Mercy went along 
with her: so as they went, her children being there also, Christiana began to 
discourse. And, Mercy, said Christiana, I take this as an unexpected favor, that 
thou shouldest set forth out of doors with me to accompany me a little in the 
way.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p2><SPAN id=vi.ii-p2.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Then said young Mercy, (for she 
was but young,) If I thought it would be to purpose to go with you, I would 
never go near the town any more.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p3><SPAN id=vi.ii-p3.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Well, Mercy, said 
Christiana, cast in thy lot with me: I well know what will be the end of our 
pilgrimage: my husband is where he would not but be for all the gold in the 
Spanish mines. Nor shalt thou be rejected, though thou goest but upon my 
invitation. The King, who hath sent for me and my children, is one that 
delighteth in mercy. Besides, if thou wilt, I will hire thee, and thou shalt go 
along with me as my servant. Yet we will have all things in common betwixt thee 
and me: only go along with me.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p4><SPAN id=vi.ii-p4.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> But how shall I be ascertained 
that I also should be entertained? Had I this hope but from one that can tell, I 
would make no stick at all, but would go, being helped by Him that can help, 
though the way was never so tedious.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p5><SPAN id=vi.ii-p5.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Well, loving Mercy, I will 
tell thee what thou shalt do: go with me to the Wicket-gate, and there I will 
further inquire for thee; and if there thou shalt not meet with encouragement, I 
will be content that thou return to thy place: I will also pay thee for thy 
kindness which thou showest to me and my children, in the accompanying of us in 
the way that thou dost.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p6><SPAN id=vi.ii-p6.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Then will I go thither, and will 
take what shall follow; and the Lord grant that my lot may there fall, even as 
the King of heaven shall have his heart upon me.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p7>Christiana then was glad at heart, not only that she had a 
companion, but also for that she had prevailed with this poor maid to fall in 
love with her own salvation. So they went on together, and Mercy began to weep. 
Then said Christiana, Wherefore weepeth my sister so?</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p8><SPAN id=vi.ii-p8.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Alas! said she, who can but 
lament, that shall but rightly consider what a state and condition my poor 
relations are in, that yet remain in our sinful town? And that which makes my 
grief the more heavy is, because they have no instructor, nor any to tell them 
what is to come.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p9><SPAN id=vi.ii-p9.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Pity becomes pilgrims; and 
thou dost weep for thy friends, as my good Christian did for me when he left me: 
he mourned for that I would not heed nor regard him; but his Lord and ours did 
gather up his tears, and put them into his bottle; and now both I and thou, and 
these my sweet babes, are reaping the fruit and benefit of them. I hope, Mercy, 
that these tears of thine will not be lost; for the truth hath said, that “they 
that sow in tears shall reap in joy.” And “he that goeth forth and weepeth, 
bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his 
sheaves with him.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.ii-p9.2

<P id=vi.ii-p10>Then said Mercy,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.ii-p11>Now my old friend proceeded, and said, But when Christiana came 
to the Slough of Despond, she began to be at a stand; For, said she, this is the 
place in which my dear husband had like to have been smothered with mud. She 
perceived, also, that notwithstanding the command of the King to make this place 
for pilgrims good, yet it was rather worse than formerly. So I asked if that was 
true. Yes, said the old gentleman, too true; for many there be that pretend to 
be the King’s laborers, and that say they are for mending the King’s highways, 
who bring dirt and dung instead of stones, and so mar instead of mending. Here 
Christiana therefore, with her boys, did make a stand. But said Mercy, Come, let 
us venture; only let us be wary. Then they looked well to their steps, and made 
a shift to get staggering over.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p12>Yet Christiana had like to have been in, and that not once or 
twice. Now they had no sooner got over, but they thought they heard words that 
said unto them, “Blessed is she that believeth; for there shall be a performance 
of those things which were told her from the Lord.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.ii-p12.1 
osisRef="Bible:Luke.1.45" parsed="|Luke|1|45|0|0" passage="Lk 1:45">Luke 
1:45</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p13>Then they went on again; and said Mercy to Christiana, had I as 
good ground to hope for a loving reception at the Wicket-gate as you, I think no 
Slough of Despond would discourage me.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p14>Well, said the other, you know your sore, and I know mine; and, 
good friend, we shall all have enough evil before we come to our journey’s end. 
For can it be imagined that the people who design to attain such excellent 
glories as we do, and who are so envied that happiness as we are, but that we 
shall meet with what fears and snares, with what troubles and afflictions they 
can possibly assault us with that hate us?</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p15>And now Mr. Sagacity left me to dream out my dream by myself. 
Wherefore, methought I saw Christiana, and Mercy, and the boys, go all of them 
up to the gate: to which, when they were come, they betook themselves to a short 
debate about how they must manage their calling at the gate, and what should be 
said unto him that did open to them: so it was concluded, since Christiana was 
the eldest, that she should knock for entrance, and that she should speak to him 
that did open, for the rest. So Christiana began to knock, and as her poor 
husband did, she knocked and knocked again. But instead of any that answered, 
they all thought they heard as if a dog came barking upon them; a dog, and a 
great one too; and this made the women and children afraid. Nor durst they for a 
while to knock any more, for fear the mastiff should fly upon them. Now, 
therefore, they were greatly tumbled up and down in their minds, and knew not 
what to do: knock they durst not, for fear of the dog; go back they durst not, 
for fear the keeper of that gate should espy them as they so went, and should be 
offended with them; at last they thought of knocking again, and knocked more 
vehemently than they did at first. Then said the keeper of the gate, Who is 
there? So the dog left off to bark, and he opened unto them.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p16>Then Christiana made low obeisance, and said, Let not our Lord 
be offended with his handmaidens, for that we have knocked at his princely gate. 
Then said the keeper, Whence come ye? And what is it that you would have?</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p17>Christiana answered, We are come from whence Christian did come, 
and upon the same errand as he; to wit, to be, if it shall please you, 
graciously admitted by this gate into the way that leads unto the Celestial 
City. And I answer, my Lord, in the next place, that I am Christiana, once the 
wife of Christian, that now is gotten above.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p18>With that the keeper of the gate did marvel, saying, What, is 
she now become a pilgrim that but a while ago abhorred that life? Then she bowed 
her head, and said, Yea; and so are these my sweet babes also.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p19>Then he took her by the hand and led her in, and said also, 
Suffer little children to come unto me; and with that he shut up the gate. This 
done, he called to a trumpeter that was above, over the gate, to entertain 
Christiana with shouting, and the sound of trumpet for joy. So he obeyed, and 
sounded, and filled the air with his melodious notes.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p20>Now all this while poor Mercy did stand without, trembling and 
crying, for fear that she was rejected. But when Christiana had got admittance 
for herself and her boys, then she began to make intercession for Mercy.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p21><SPAN id=vi.ii-p21.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> And she said, My Lord, I 
have a companion that stands yet without, that is come hither upon the same 
account as myself: one that is much dejected in her mind, for that she comes, as 
she thinks, without sending for; whereas I was sent for by my husband’s King to 
come.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p22>Now Mercy began to be very impatient, and each minute was as 
long to her as an hour; wherefore she prevented Christiana from a fuller 
interceding for her, by knocking at the gate herself. And she knocked then so 
loud that she made Christiana to start. Then said the keeper of the gate, Who is 
there? And Christiana said, It is my friend.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p23>So he opened the gate, and looked out, but Mercy was fallen down 
without in a swoon, for she fainted, and was afraid that no gate should be 
opened to her.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p24>Then he took her by the hand, and said, Damsel, I bid thee 
arise.</P>
<P id=vi.ii-p25>Oh, sir, said she, I am faint; there is scarce life left in me.

kept close in another man’s ground, only my pilgrims hear his barking; he 
belongs to the castle which you see there at a distance, but can come up to the

better, by the great voice of his roaring. Indeed, he that owneth him doth not 
keep him out of any good-will to me or mine, but with intent to keep the 
pilgrims from coming to me, and that they may be afraid to come and knock at 
this gate for entrance. Sometimes also he has broken out, and has worried some 
that I loved; but I take all at present patiently. I also give my pilgrims 
timely help, so that they are not delivered to his power, to do with them what 
his doggish nature would prompt him to. But what my purchased one, I trow, hadst 
thou known never so much beforehand, thou wouldest not have been afraid of a 
dog. The beggars that go from door to door, will, rather than lose a supposed 
alms, run the hazard of the bawling, barking, and biting too of a dog; and shall 
a dog, a dog in another man’s yard, a dog whose barking I turn to the profit of 
pilgrims, keep any from coming to me? I deliver them from the lions, and my

<P id=vi.iii-p3>Now there was, on the other side of the wall that fenced in the 
way up which Christiana and her companions were to go, a garden, and that garden 
belonged to him whose was that barking dog, of whom mention was made before. And 
some of the fruit-trees that grew in that garden shot their branches over the 
wall; and being mellow, they that found them did gather them up, and eat of them 
to their hurt. So Christiana’s boys, as boys are apt to do, being pleased with 
the trees, and with the fruit that hung thereon, did pluck them, and began to 
eat. Their mother did also chide them for so doing, But still the boys went 
on.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p4>Well, said she, my sons, you transgress, for that fruit is none 
of ours; but she did not know that it belonged to the enemy: I’ll warrant you, 
if she had she would have been ready to die for fear. But that passed, and they 
went on their way. Now, by that they were gone about two bow-shots from the 
place that led them into the way, they espied two very ill-favored ones coming 
down apace to meet them. With that, Christiana and Mercy her friend covered 
themselves with their veils, and so kept on their journey: the children also 
went on before; so that at last they met together. Then they that came down to 
meet them, came just up to the women, as if they would embrace them; but 
Christiana said, stand back, or go peaceably as you should. Yet these two, as 
men that are deaf, regarded not Christiana’s words, but began to lay hands upon 
them: at that Christiana waxing very wroth, spurned at them with her feet. Mercy 
also, as well as she could, did what she could to shift them. Christiana again 
said to them, Stand back, and be gone, for we have no money to lose, being 
pilgrims, as you see, and such too as live upon the charity of our friends.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p5><SPAN id=vi.iii-p5.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">ILL-FAVORED ONES:</SPAN> Then said one of the 
two men, We make no assault upon you for money, but are come out to tell you, 
that if you will but grant one small request which we shall ask, we will make 
women of you for ever.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p6><SPAN id=vi.iii-p6.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Now Christiana, imagining 
what they should mean, made answer again, We will neither hear, nor regard, nor 
yield to what you shall ask. We are in haste, and cannot stay; our business is a 
business of life and death. So again she and her companion made a fresh essay to 
go past them; but they letted them in their way.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p7><SPAN id=vi.iii-p7.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">ILL-FAVORED ONES:</SPAN> And they said, We 
intend no hurt to your lives; it is another thing we would have.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p8><SPAN id=vi.iii-p8.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Aye, quoth Christiana, you 
would have us body and soul, for I know it is for that you are come; but we will 
die rather upon the spot, than to suffer ourselves to be brought into such 
snares as shall hazard our well-being hereafter. And with that they both 
shrieked out, and cried, Murder! murder! and so put themselves under those laws 
that are provided for the protection of women. <SCRIPREF id=vi.iii-p8.2

approach upon them, with design to prevail against them. They therefore cried 
out again.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p9>Now they being, as I said, not far from the gate in at which 
they came, their voice was heard from whence they were, thither: wherefore some 
of the house came out, and knowing that it was Christiana’s tongue, they made 
haste to her relief. But by that they were got within sight of them, the women 
were in a very great scuffle; the children also stood crying by. Then did he 
that came in for their relief call out to the ruffians, saying, What is that 
thing you do? Would you make my Lord’s people to transgress? He also attempted 
to take them, but they did make their escape over the wall into the garden of 
the man to whom the great dog belonged; so the dog became their protector. This 
Reliever then came up to the women, and asked them how they did. So they 
answered, We thank thy Prince, pretty well, only we have been somewhat 
affrighted: we thank thee also for that thou camest in to our help, otherwise we 
had been overcome.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p10><SPAN id=vi.iii-p10.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">RELIEVER:</SPAN> So, after a few more words, 
this Reliever said as followeth: I marveled much, when you were entertained at 
the gate above, seeing ye knew that ye were but weak women, that you petitioned 
not the Lord for a conductor; then might you have avoided these troubles and 
dangers; for he would have granted you one.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p11><SPAN id=vi.iii-p11.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Alas! said Christiana, we 
were so taken with our present blessing, that dangers to come were forgotten by 
us. Besides, who could have thought, that so near the King’s palace there could 
have lurked such naughty ones? Indeed, it had been well for us had we asked our 
Lord for one; but since our Lord knew it would be for our profit, I wonder he 
sent not one along with us.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p12><SPAN id=vi.iii-p12.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">RELIEVER:</SPAN> It is not always necessary to 
grant things not asked for, lest by so doing they become of little esteem; but 
when the want of a thing is felt, it then comes under, in the eyes of him that 
feels it, that estimate that properly is its due, and so consequently will be 
thereafter used. Had my Lord granted you a conductor, you would not either so 
have bewailed that oversight of yours, in not asking for one, as now you have 
occasion to do. So all things work for good, and tend to make you more wary.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p13><SPAN id=vi.iii-p13.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Shall we go back again to my

<P id=vi.iii-p14><SPAN id=vi.iii-p14.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">RELIEVER:</SPAN> Your confession of your folly 
I will present him with. To go back again, you need not, for in all places where 
you shall come, you will find no want at all; for in every one of my Lord’s 
lodgings, which he has prepared for the reception of his pilgrims, there is 
sufficient to furnish them against all attempts whatsoever. But, as I said, He 
will be inquired of by them, to do it for them. <SCRIPREF id=vi.iii-p14.2

had thus said, he went back to his place, and the pilgrims went on their 
way.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p15><SPAN id=vi.iii-p15.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Then said Mercy, What a sudden

<P id=vi.iii-p16><SPAN id=vi.iii-p16.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Thy innocency, my sister, 
said Christiana to Mercy, may excuse thee much; but as for me, my fault is so 
much the greater, for that I saw this danger before I came out of the doors, and 
yet did not provide for it when provision might have been had. I am much to be 
blamed.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p17><SPAN id=vi.iii-p17.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Then said Mercy, How knew you 
this before you came from home? Pray open to me this riddle.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p18><SPAN id=vi.iii-p18.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Why, I will tell you. Before 
I set foot out of doors, one night as I lay in my bed I had a dream about this; 
for methought I saw two men, as like these as ever any in the world could look, 
stand at my bed’s feet, plotting how they might prevent my salvation. I will 
tell you their very words. They said, (it was when I was in my troubles,) What 
shall we do with this woman? for she cries out, waking and sleeping, for 
forgiveness: if she be sufferet do go on as she begins, we shall lose her as we 
have lost her husband. This you know might have made me take heed, and have 
provided when provision might have been had.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p19><SPAN id=vi.iii-p19.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Well, said Mercy, as by this 
neglect we have an occasion ministered unto us to behold our own imperfections, 
so our Lord has taken occasion thereby to make manifest the riches of his grace; 
for he, as we see, has followed us with unasked kindness, and has delivered us 
from their hands that were stronger than we, of his mere good pleasure.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p20>Thus now, when they had talked away a little more time, they 
drew near to a house which stood in the way, which house was built for the 
relief of pilgrims, as you will find more fully related in the first part of 
these records of the Pilgrim’s Progress. So they drew on towards the house, (the 
house of the Interpreter;) and when they came to the door, they heard a great 
talk in the house. Then they gave ear, and heard, as they thought, Christiana 
mentioned by name; for you must know that there went along, even before her, a 
talk of her and her children’s going on pilgrimage. And this was the most 
pleasing to them, because they had heard that she was Christian’s wife, that 
woman who was some time ago so unwilling to hear of going on pilgrimage. Thus, 
therefore, they stood still, and heard the good people within commending her who 
they little thought stood at the door. At last Christiana knocked, as she had 
done at the gate before. Now, when she had knocked, there came to the door a 
young damsel, and opened the door, and looked, and behold, two women were 
there.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p21><SPAN id=vi.iii-p21.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">THE

and we now at this door are such: wherefore we pray that we may be partakers of 
that for which we at this time are come; for the day, as thou seest, is very far

he came to the door and looking upon her, he said, Art thou that Christiana whom

<P id=vi.iii-p30>So when they were within, they were bidden to sit down and rest 
them; the which when they had done, those that attended upon the pilgrims in the 
house came into the room to see them. And one smiled, and another smiled, and 
they all smiled for joy that Christiana was become a pilgrim: They also looked 
upon the boys; they stroked them over their faces with the hand, in token of 
their kind reception of them: they also carried it lovingly to Mercy, and bid 
them all welcome into their Master’s house.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p31>After a while, because supper was not ready, the Interpreter 
took them into his Significant Rooms, and showed them what Christian, 
Christiana’s husband, had seen some time before. Here, therefore, they saw the 
man in the cage, the man and his dream, the man that cut his way through his 
enemies, and the picture of the biggest of them all, together with the rest of 
those things that were then so profitable to Christian.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p32>This done, and after those things had been somewhat digested by 
Christiana and her company, the Interpreter takes them apart again, and has them 
first into a room where was a man that could look no way but downwards, with a 
muck-rake in his hand. There stood also one over his head with a celestial crown 
in his hand, and proffered him that crown for his muck-rake; but the man did 
neither look up nor regard, but raked to himself the straws, the small sticks, 
and dust of the floor.</P>

most, are the great things now looked after.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p37>With that Christiana and Mercy wept, and said, It is, alas! too 
true.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p38>When the Interpreter had shown them this, he had them into the 
very best room in the house; a very brave room it was. So he bid them look round 
about, and see if they could find any thing profitable there. Then they looked 
round and round; for there was nothing to be seen but a very great spider on the 
wall, and that they overlooked.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p39><SPAN id=vi.iii-p39.1

nothing; but Christiana held her peace.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p40><SPAN id=vi.iii-p40.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">INTERPRETER:</SPAN> But, said the Interpreter, 
look again. She therefore looked again, and said, Here is not any thing but an 
ugly spider, who hangs by her hands upon the wall. Then said he, Is there but 
one spider in all this spacious room? Then the water stood in Christiana’s eyes, 
for she was a woman quick of apprehension; and she said, Yea, Lord, there are 
more here than one; yea, and spiders whose venom is far more destructive than 
that which is in her. The Interpreter then looked pleasantly on her, and said, 
Thou hast said the truth. This made Mercy to blush, and the boys to cover their 
faces; for they all began now to understand the riddle.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p41>Then said the Interpreter again, “The spider taketh hold with 
her hands,” as you see, “and is in kings’ palaces.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.iii-p41.1 
osisRef="Bible:Prov.30.28" parsed="|Prov|30|28|0|0" passage="Pr 30:28">Prov.

full of the venom of sin soever you be, yet you may, by the hand of Faith, lay 
hold of and dwell in the best room that belongs to the King’s house above?</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p42><SPAN id=vi.iii-p42.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> I thought, said Christiana, 
of something of this; but I could not imagine it at all. I thought that we were 
like spiders, and that we looked like ugly creatures, in what fine room soever 
we were: but that by this spider, that venomous and ill-favored creature, we 
were to learn how to act faith, that came not into my thoughts; and yet she had 
taken hold with her hands, and, as I see, dwelleth in the best room in the 
house. God has made nothing in vain.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p43>Then they seemed all to be glad; but the water stood in their 
eyes; yet they looked one upon another, and also bowed before the 
Interpreter.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p44>He had them into another room, where were a hen and chickens, 
and bid them observe a while. So one of the chickens went to the trough to 
drink, and every time she drank she lifted up her head and her eyes towards 
heaven. See, said he, what this little chick doth, and learn of her to 
acknowledge whence your mercies come, by receiving them with looking up. Yet 
again, said he, observe and look: so they gave heed, and perceived that the hen 
did walk in a fourfold method towards her chickens: 1. She had a common call, 
and that she hath all the day long. 2. She had a special call, and that she had 
but sometimes. 3. She had a brooding note. <SCRIPREF id=vi.iii-p44.1 
osisRef="Bible:Matt.23.37" parsed="|Matt|23|37|0|0" passage="Mt 23:37">Matt.

<P id=vi.iii-p45>Now, said he, compare this hen to your King and these chickens 
to his obedient ones; for, answerable to her, he himself hath his methods which 
he walketh in towards his people. By his common call, he gives nothing; by his 
special call, he always has something to give; he has also a brooding voice, for 
them that are under his wing; and he has an outcry, to give the alarm when he 
seeth the enemy come. I choose, my darlings, to lead you into the room where 
such things are, because you are women, and they are easy for you.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p46><SPAN id=vi.iii-p46.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> And, sir, said Christiana, 
pray let us see some more. So he had them into the slaughter-house, where was a 
butcher killing a sheep; and behold, the sheep was quiet, and took her death 
patiently. Then said the Interpreter, You must learn of this sheep to suffer and 
to put up with wrongs without murmurings and complaints. Behold how quietly she 
takes her death, and, without objecting, she suffereth her skin to be pulled 
over her ears. Your King doth call you his sheep.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p47>After this he led them into his garden, where was great variety 
of flowers; and he, said, Do you see all these? So Christiana said, Yes. Then 
said he again, Behold, the flowers are diverse in stature, in quality, and 
color, and smell, and virtue; and some are better than others; also, where the 
gardener has set them, there they stand, and quarrel not one with another.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p48>Again, he had them into his field, which he had sown with wheat 
and corn: but when they beheld, the tops of all were cut off, and only the straw 
remained. He said again, This ground was dunged, and ploughed, and sowed, but 
what shall we do with the crop? Then said Christiana, Burn some, and make muck 
of the rest. Then said the Interpreter again, Fruit, you see, is that thing you 
look for; and for want of that you condemn it to the fire, and to be trodden 
under foot of men: beware that in this you condemn not yourselves.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p49>Then, as they were coming in from abroad, they espied a little 
robin with a great spider in his mouth. So the Interpreter said, Look here. So 
they looked, and Mercy wondered, but Christiana said, What a disparagement is it 
to such a pretty little bird as the . robin-red-breast; he being also a bird 
above many, that loveth to maintain a kind of sociableness with men! I had 
thought they had lived upon crumbs of bread, or upon other such harmless matter: 
I like him worse than I did.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p50>The Interpreter then replied, This robin is an emblem, very apt 
to set forth some professors by; for to sight they are, as this robin, pretty of 
note, color, and carriage. They seem also to have a very great love for 
professors that are sincere; and, above all others, to desire to associate with 
them, and to be in their company, as if they could live upon the good man’s 
crumbs. They pretend also, that therefore it is that they frequent the house of 
the godly, and the appointments of the Lord: but when they are by themselves, as 
the robin, they can catch and gobble up spiders; they can change their diet, 
drink iniquity, and swallow down sin like water.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p51>So, when they were come again into the house, because supper as 
yet was not ready, Christiana again desired that the Interpreter would either 
show or tell some other things that are profitable.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p52>Then the Interpreter began, and said, The fatter the sow is, 
the more she desires the mire; the fatter the ox is, the more gamesomely he goes 
to the slaughter; and the more healthy the lustful man is, the more prone he is 
unto evil. There is a desire in women to go neat and find; and it is a comely 
thing to be adorned with that which in God’s sight is of great price. ‘T is 
easier watching a night or two, than to sit up a whole year together: so ‘t is 
easier for one to begin to profess well, than to hold out as he should to the 
end. Every shipmaster, when in a storm, will willingly cast that overboard which 
is of the smallest value in the vessel; but who will throw the best out first? 
None but he that feareth not God. One leak will sink a ship, and one sin will 
destroy a sinner. He that forgets his friend is ungrateful unto him; but he that 
forgets his Saviour is unmerciful to himself. He that lives in sin, and looks 
for happiness hereafter, is like him that soweth cockle, and thinks to fill his 
barn with wheat or barley. If a man would live well, let him fetch his last day 
to him, and make it always his company-keeper. Whispering, and change of 
thoughts, prove that sin is in the world. If the world, which God sets light by, 
is counted a thing of that worth with men, what is heaven, that God commendeth? 
If the life that is attended with so many troubles, is so loth to be let go by 
us, what is the life above? Every body will cry up the goodness of men; but who 
is there that is, as he should be, affected with the goodness of God? We seldom 
sit down to meat, but we eat, and leave. So there is in Jesus Christ more merit 
and righteousness than the whole world has need of.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p53>When the Interpreter had done, he takes them out into his 
garden again, and had them to a tree whose inside was all rotten and gone, and 
yet it grew and had leaves. Then said Mercy, What means this? This tree, said 
he, whose outside is fair, and whose inside is rotten, is that to which many may 
be compared that are in the garden of God; who with their mouths speak high in 
behalf of God, but indeed will do nothing for him; whose leaves are fair, but 
their heart good for nothing but to be tinder for the devil’s tinder-box.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p54>Now supper was ready, the table spread, and all things set on 
the board: so they sat down, and did eat, when one had given thanks. And the 
Interpreter did usually entertain those that lodged with him with music at 
meals; so the minstrels played. There was also one that did sing, and a very 
fine voice he had. His song was this:</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“The Lord is only my support,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he that doth me feed;<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>How can I then want 
any thing<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereof I stand in need?”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.iii-p55>When the song and music were ended, the Interpreter asked 
Christiana what it was that at first did move her thus to betake herself to a 
pilgrim’s life. Christiana answered, First, the loss of my husband came into my 
mind, at which I was heartily grieved; but all that was but natural affection. 
Then after that came the troubles and pilgrimage of my husband into my mind, and 
also how like a churl I had carried it to him as to that. So guilt took hold of 
my mind, and would have drawn me into the pond, but that opportunely I had a 
dream of the well-being of my husband, and a letter sent me by the King of that 
country where my husband dwells, to come to him. The dream and the letter 
together so wrought upon my mind that they forced me to this way.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p56><SPAN id=vi.iii-p56.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">INTERPRETER:</SPAN> But met you with no 
opposition before you set out of doors?</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p57><SPAN id=vi.iii-p57.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Yes, a neighbor of mine, one 
Mrs. Timorous: she was akin to him that would have persuaded my husband to go 
back, for fear of the lions. She also befooled me, for, as she called it, my 
intended desperate adventure; she also urged what she could to dishearten me 
from it, the hardships and troubles that my husband met with in the way; but all 
this I got over pretty well. But a dream that I had of two ill-looking ones, 
that I thought did plot how to make me miscarry in my journey, that hath 
troubled me much: yea, it still runs in my mind, and makes me afraid of every 
one that I meet, lest they should meet me to do me a mischief, and to turn me 
out of my way. Yea, I may tell my Lord, though I would not have every body know 
of it, that between this and the gate by which we got into the way, we were both 
so sorely assaulted that we were made to cry out murder; and the two that made 
this assault upon us, were like the two that I saw in my dream.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p58>Then said the Interpreter, Thy beginning is good; thy latter 
end shall greatly increase. So he addressed himself to Mercy, and said unto her, 
And what moved thee to come hither, sweet heart?</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p59><SPAN id=vi.iii-p59.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Then Mercy blushed and trembled, 
and for a while continued silent.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p60><SPAN id=vi.iii-p60.1

afraid; only believe, and speak thy mind.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p61><SPAN id=vi.iii-p61.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> So she began, and said, Truly, 
sir, my want of experience is that which makes me covet to be in silence, and 
that also that fills me with fears of coming short at last. I cannot tell of 
visions and dreams, as my friend Christiana can; nor know I what it is to mourn 
for my refusing the counsel of those that were good relations.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p62><SPAN id=vi.iii-p62.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">INTERPRETER:</SPAN> What was it, then, dear 
heart, that hath prevailed with thee to do as thou hast done?</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p63><SPAN id=vi.iii-p63.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Why, when our friend here was 
packing up to be gone from our town, I and another went accidentally to see her. 
So we knocked at the door and went in. When we were within, and seeing what she 
was doing, we asked her what was her meaning. She said she was sent for to go to 
her husband; and then she up and told us how she had seen him in a dream, 
dwelling in a curious place, among immortals, wearing a crown, playing upon a 
harp, eating and drinking at his Prince’s table, and singing praises to him for 
bringing him thither, etc. Now, methought, while she was telling these things 
unto us, my heart burned within me. And I said in my heart, If this be true, I 
will leave my father and my mother, and the land of my nativity, and will, if I 
may, go along with Christiana. So I asked her further of the truth of these 
things, and if she would let me go with her; for I saw now that there was no 
dwelling, but with the danger of ruin, any longer in our town. But yet I came 
away with a heavy heart; not for that I was unwilling to come away, but for that 
so many of my relations were left behind. And I am come with all the desire of 
my heart, and will go, if I may, with Christiana unto her husband and his 
King.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p64><SPAN id=vi.iii-p64.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">INTERPRETER:</SPAN> Thy setting out is good, 
for thou hast given credit to the truth; thou art a Ruth, who did, for the love 
she bare to Naomi and to the Lord her God, leave father and mother, and the land 
of her nativity, to come out and go with a people she knew not heretofore. “The 
Lord recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of 
Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.iii-p64.2

<P id=vi.iii-p65>Now supper was ended, and preparation was made for bed; the 
women were laid singly alone, and the boys by themselves. Now when Mercy was in 
bed, she could not sleep for joy, for that now her doubts of missing at last 
were removed further from her than ever they were before. So she lay blessing 
and praising God, who had such favor for her.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p66>In the morning they arose with the sun, and prepared themselves 
for their departure; but the Interpreter would have them tarry a while; For, 
said he, you must orderly go from hence. Then said he to the damsel that first 
opened unto them, Take them and have them into the garden to the bath, and there 
wash them and make them clean from the soil which they had gathered by 
traveling. Then Innocent the damsel took them and led them into the garden, and 
brought them to the bath; so she told them that there they must wash and be 
clean, for so her Master would have the women to do that called at his house as 
they were going on pilgrimage. Then they went in and washed, yea, they and the 
boys, and all; and they came out of that bath, not only sweet and clean, but 
also much enlivened and strengthened in their joints. So when they came in, they 
looked fairer a deal than when they went out to the washing.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p67>When they were returned out of the garden from the bath, the 
Interpreter took them and looked upon them, and said unto them, “Fair as the 
moon.” Then he called for the seal wherewith they used to be sealed that were 
washed in his bath. So the seal was brought, and he set his mark upon them, that 
they might be known in the places whither they were yet to go. Now the seal was 
the contents and sum of the passover which the children of Israel did eat, 
<SCRIPREF id=vi.iii-p67.1 osisRef="Bible:Exod.13.8-Exod.13.10"

they came out of the land of Egypt; and the mark was set between their eyes. 
This seal greatly added to their beauty, for it was an ornament to their faces. 
It also added to their gravity, and made their countenance more like those of 
angels.</P>
<P id=vi.iii-p68>Then said the Interpreter again to the damsel that waited upon 
these women, Go into the vestry, and fetch out garments for these people. So she 
went and fetched out white raiment, and laid it down before him; so he commanded 
them to put it on: it was fine linen, white and clean. When the women were thus 
adorned, they seemed to be a terror one to the other; for that they could not 
see that glory each one had in herself, which they could see in each other. Now 
therefore they began to esteem each other better than themselves. For, You are 
fairer than I am, said one; and, You are more comely than I am, said another. 
The children also stood amazed, to see into what fashion they were brought.</P>
<P class=div2>THE THIRD STAGE</P>
<H2 id=vi.iv-p0.1><A id=vi.iv-p0.2></A>THE THIRD STAGE</H2>
<P id=vi.iv-p1>The Interpreter then called for a man-servant of his, one 
Great-heart, and bid him take A sword, and helmet, and shield; and, Take these 
my daughters, said he, conduct them to the house called Beautiful, at which 
place they will rest next. So he took his weapons, and went before them; and the 
Interpreter said, God speed. Those also that belonged to the family, sent them 
away with many a good wish. So they went on their way, and sang,</P><SPAN

<P id=vi.iv-p2>Now I saw in my dream, that they went on, and Great-Heart before 
them. So they went, and came to the place where Christian’s burden fell off his 
back and tumbled into a sepulchre. Here then they made a pause; and here also 
they blessed God. Now, said Christiana, it comes to my mind what was said to us 
at the gate, to wit, that we should have pardon by word and deed: by word, that 
is, by the promise; by deed, to wit, in the way it was obtained. What the 
promise is, of that I know something; but what is it to have pardon by deed, or 
in the way that it was obtained, Mr. Great-Heart, I suppose you know; wherefore, 
if you please, let us hear your discourse thereof.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p3><SPAN id=vi.iv-p3.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Pardon by the deed done, is pardon obtained by some one for 
another that hath need thereof; not by the person pardoned, but in the way, 
saith another, in which I have obtained it. So then, to speak to the question 
more at large, the pardon that you, and Mercy, and these boys have attained, was 
obtained by another; to wit, by him that let you in at the gate. And he hath 
obtained it in this double way; he hath performed righteousness to cover you, 
and spilt his blood to wash you in.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p4><SPAN id=vi.iv-p4.1

<P id=vi.iv-p6><SPAN id=vi.iv-p6.1

<P id=vi.iv-p7><SPAN id=vi.iv-p7.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> With all my heart: but first I must premise, that he of whom 
we are now about to speak, is one that has not his fellow: He has two natures in 
one person, plain to be distinguished, impossible to be divided. Unto each of 
these natures a righteousness belongeth, and each righteousness is essential to 
that nature; so that one may as easily cause that nature to be extinct, as to 
separate its justice or righteousness from it. Of these righteousnesses 
therefore, we are not made partakers, so as that they, or any of them, should be 
put upon us, that we might be made just, and live thereby. Besides these, there 
is a righteousness which this person has, as these two natures are joined in 
one. And this is not the righteousness of the Godhead, as distinguished from the 
manhood; nor the righteousness of the manhood, as distinguished from the 
Godhead; but a righteousness which standeth in the union of both natures, and 
may properly be called the righteousness that is essential to his being prepared 
of God to the capacity of the mediatory office, which he was to be entrusted 
with. If he parts with his first righteousness, he parts with his Godhead; if he 
parts with his second righteousness, he parts with the purity of his manhood; if 
he parts with his third, he parts with that perfection that capacitates him to 
the office of mediation. He has therefore another righteousness, which standeth 
in performance, or obedience to a revealed will; and that is what he puts upon 
sinners, and that by which their sins are covered. Wherefore he saith, “As by 
one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall 
many be made righteous.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.iv-p7.2 osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.19"

office, and cannot be communicated unto another, yet it is by virtue of them 
that the righteousness that justifies is for that purpose efficacious. The 
righteousness of his Godhead gives virtue to his obedience; the righteousness of 
his manhood giveth capability to his obedience to justify; and the righteousness 
that standeth in the union of these two natures to his office, giveth authority 
to that righteousness to do the work for which it was ordained.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p10>So then here is a righteousness that Christ, as God, has no need 
of; for he is God without it: Here is a righteousness that Christ, as man, has 
no need of to make him so; for he is perfect man without it. Again, here is a 
righteousness that Christ, as God-man, has no need of; for he is perfectly so 
without it. Here then is a righteousness that Christ, as God, and as God-man, 
has no need of, with reference to himself, and therefore he can spare it; a 
justifying righteousness, that he for himself wanteth not, and therefore giveth 
it away: Hence it is called the gift of righteousness. This righteousness, since 
Christ Jesus the Lord has made himself under the law, must be given away; for 
the law doth not only bind him that is under it, to do justly, but to use 
charity. <SCRIPREF id=vi.iv-p10.1 osisRef="Bible:Rom.5.17" 
parsed="|Rom|5|17|0|0" passage="Rom 5:17">Rom. 5:17</SCRIPREF>. Wherefore he 
must, or ought by the law, if he hath two coats, to give one to him that hath 
none. Now, our Lord indeed hath two coats, one for himself, and one to spare; 
wherefore he freely bestows one upon those that have none. And thus, Christiana 
and Mercy, and the rest of you that are here, doth your pardon come by deed, or 
by the work of another man. Your Lord Christ is he that worked, and hath given 
away what he wrought for, to the next poor beggar he meets.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p11>But again, in order to pardon by deed, there must something be 
paid to God as a price, as well as something prepared to cover us withal. Sin 
has delivered us up to the just curse of a righteous law: now from this curse we 
must be justified by way of redemption, a price being paid for the harms we have 
done; and this is by the blood of your Lord, who came and stood in your place 
and stead, and died your death for your transgressions: Thus has he ransomed you 
from your transgressions by blood, and covered your polluted and deformed souls 
with righteousness, <SCRIPREF id=vi.iv-p11.1 osisRef="Bible:Rom.8.34"

<P id=vi.iv-p12><SPAN id=vi.iv-p12.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> This is brave! Now I see 
that there was something to be learned by our being pardoned by word and deed. 
Good Mercy, let us labor to keep this in mind: and, my children, do you remember 
it also. But, sir, was not this it that made my good Christian’s burden fall 
from off his shoulder, and that made him give three leaps for joy?</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p13><SPAN id=vi.iv-p13.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Yes, it was the belief of this that cut those strings that 
could not be cut by other means; and it was to give him a proof of the virtue of 
this, that he was suffered to carry his burden to the cross.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p14><SPAN id=vi.iv-p14.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> I thought so; for though my 
heart was lightsome and joyous before, yet it is ten times more lightsome and 
joyous now. And I am persuaded by what I have felt, though I have felt but 
little as yet, that if the most burdened man in the world was here, and did see 
and believe as I now do, it would make his heart the more merry and blithe.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p15><SPAN id=vi.iv-p15.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> There is not only comfort and the ease of a burden brought 
to us by the sight and consideration of these, but an endeared affection begot 
in us by it: for who can, if he doth but once think that pardon comes not only 
by promise but thus, but be affected with the way and means of his redemption, 
and so with the man that hath wrought it for him?</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p16><SPAN id=vi.iv-p16.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> True; methinks it makes my 
heart bleed to think that he should bleed for me. Oh, thou loving One: Oh, thou 
blessed One. Thou deservest to have me; thou hast bought me. Thou deservest to 
have me all: thou hast paid for me ten thousand times more than I am worth. No 
marvel that this made the tears stand in my husband’s eyes, and that it made him 
trudge so nimbly on. I am persuaded he wished me with him: but, vile wretch that 
I was, I let him come all alone. Oh, Mercy, that thy father and mother were 
here; yea, and Mrs. Timorous also: nay, I wish now with all my heart that here 
was Madam Wanton too. Surely, surely, their hearts would be affected; nor could 
the fear of the one, nor the powerful lusts of the other, prevail with them to 
go home again, and to refuse to become good pilgrims.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p17><SPAN id=vi.iv-p17.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> You speak now in the warmth of your affections; will it, 
think you, be always thus with you? Besides, this is not communicated to every 
one, nor to every one that did see your Jesus bleed. There were that stood by, 
and that saw the blood run from the heart to the ground, and yet were so far off 
this, that instead of lamenting, they laughed at him, and, instead of becoming 
his disciples, did harden their hearts against him. So that all that you have, 
my daughters, you have by peculiar impression made by a divine contemplating 
upon what I have spoken to you. Remember, that ‘twas told you, that the hen, by 
her common call, gives no meat to her chickens. This you have therefore by a 
special grace.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p18>Now I saw in my dream, that they went on until they were come to 
the place that Simple, and Sloth, and Presumption, lay and slept in when 
Christian went by on pilgrimage: and behold, they were hanged up in irons a 
little way off on the other side.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p19><SPAN id=vi.iv-p19.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Then said Mercy to him that was 
their guide and conductor, what are these three men; and for what are they 
hanged there?</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p20><SPAN id=vi.iv-p20.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> These three men were men of very bad qualities; they had no 
mind to be pilgrims themselves, and whomsoever they could, they hindered. They 
were sloth and folly themselves, and whomsoever they could persuade they made so 
too, and withal taught them to presume that they should do well at last. They 
were asleep when Christian went by; and now you go by, they are hanged.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p21><SPAN id=vi.iv-p21.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> But could they persuade any to be 
of their opinion?</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p22><SPAN id=vi.iv-p22.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Yes, they turned several out of the way. There was Slow-pace 
that they persuaded to do as they. They also prevailed with one Short-wind, with 
one No-heart, with one Linger-after-Lust, and with one Sleepy-head, and with a 
young woman, her name was Dull, to turn out of the way and become as they. 
Besides, they brought up an ill report of your Lord, persuading others that he 
was a hard taskmaster. They also brought up an evil report of the good Land, 
saying, it was not half so good as some pretended it was. They also began to 
vilify his servants, and to count the best of them meddlesome, troublesome 
busybodies. Further, they would call the bread of God husks; the comforts of his 
children, fancies; the travel and labor of pilgrims, things to no purpose.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p23><SPAN id=vi.iv-p23.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Nay, said Christiana, if 
they were such, they shall never be bewailed by me: they have but what they 
deserve; and I think it is well that they stand so near the highway, that others 
may see and take warning. But had it not been well if their crimes had been 
engraven in some plate of iron or brass, and left here where they did their 
mischiefs, for a caution to other bad men?</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p24><SPAN id=vi.iv-p24.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> So it is, as you may well perceive, if you will go a little 
to the wall.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p25><SPAN id=vi.iv-p25.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> No, no; let them hang, and their 
names rot, and their crimes live forever against them. I think it a high favor 
that they were hanged before we came hither: who knows else what they might have 
done to such poor women as we are? Then she turned it into a song, 
saying,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Now then you three hang there, and be a sign<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>To all that shall 
against the truth combine.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>And let him that comes after, fear this end,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>If unto pilgrims he 
is not a friend.<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

opposers are.”<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.iv-p26>Thus they went on till they came to the foot of the hill 
Difficulty, where again the good Mr. Great-Heart took an occasion to tell them 
what happened there when Christian himself went by. So he had them first to the 
spring. Lo, saith he, this is the spring that Christian drank of before he went 
up this hill: and then it was clear and good; but now it is dirty with the feet 
of some that are not desirous that pilgrims here should quench their thirst. 
<SCRIPREF id=vi.iv-p26.1 osisRef="Bible:Ezek.34.18 Bible:Ezek.34.19" 
parsed="|Ezek|34|18|0|0;|Ezek|34|19|0|0" passage="Eze 34:18,19">Ezek. 
34:18,19</SCRIPREF>. Thereat Mercy said, And why so envious, trow? But, said 
their guide, it will do, if taken up and put into a vessel that is sweet and 
good; for then the dirt will sink to the bottom, and the water come out by 
itself more clear. Thus therefore Christiana and her companions were compelled 
to do. They took it up, and put it into an earthen pot, and so let it stand till 
the dirt was gone to the bottom, and then they drank thereof.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p27>Next he showed them the two by-ways that were at the foot of the 
hill, where Formality and Hypocrisy lost themselves. And, said he, these are 
dangerous paths. Two were here cast away when Christian came by; and although, 
as you see these ways are since stopped up with chains, posts, and a ditch, yet 
there are those that will choose to adventure here rather than take the pains to 
go up this hill.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p28><SPAN id=vi.iv-p28.1

necks.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p29><SPAN id=vi.iv-p29.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> They will venture: yea, if at any time any of the King’s 
servants do happen to see them, and do call upon them, and tell them that they 
are in the wrong way, and do bid them beware of the danger, then they railingly 
return them answer, and say, “As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in 
the name of the King, we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly do 
whatsoever thing goeth out of our own mouths.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.iv-p29.2

further, you shall see that these ways are made cautionary enough, not only by 
these posts, and ditch, and chain, but also by being hedged up: yet they will 
choose to go there.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p30><SPAN id=vi.iv-p30.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> They are idle; they love not 
to take pains; up-hill way is unpleasant to them. So it is fulfilled unto them 
as it is written, “The way of the slothful man is full of thorns.” <SCRIPREF 
id=vi.iv-p30.2 osisRef="Bible:Prov.15.19" parsed="|Prov|15|19|0|0" 
passage="Pr 15:19">Prov. 15:19</SCRIPREF>. Yea, they will rather choose to walk 
upon a snare than to go up this hill, and the rest of this way to the city.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p31>Then they set forward, and began to go up the hill, and up the 
hill they went. But before they got to the top, Christiana began to pant, and 
said, I dare say this is a breathing hill; no marvel if they that love their 
ease more than their souls choose to themselves a smoother way.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p32>Then said Mercy, I must sit down: also the least of the children 
began to cry. Come, come, said Great-Heart, sit not down here; for a little 
above is the Prince’s arbor. Then he took the little boy by the hand, and led 
him up thereto.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p33>When they were come to the arbor, they were very willing to sit 
down, for they were all in a pelting heat. Then said Mercy, “How sweet is rest 
to them that labor.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.iv-p33.1 osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.28" 
parsed="|Matt|11|28|0|0" passage="Mt 11:28">Matt. 11:28</SCRIPREF>; and how good 
is the Prince of pilgrims to provide such resting-places for them! Of this arbor 
I have heard much; but I never saw it before. But here let us beware of 
sleeping; for, as I have heard, it cost poor Christian dear.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p34>Then said Mr. Great-Heart to the little ones, Come, my pretty 
boys, how do you do? What think you now of going on pilgrimage? Sir, said the 
least, I was almost beat out of heart; but I thank you for lending me a hand at 
my need. And I remember now what my mother hath told me, namely, that the way to 
heaven is as a ladder, and the way to hell is as down a hill. But I had rather 
go up the ladder to life, than down the hill to death.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p35>Then said Mercy, But the proverb is, “To go down the hill is 
easy.” But James said, (for that was his name,) The day is coming when, in my 
opinion, when going down the hill will be the hardest of all. ‘Tis a good boy, 
said his master; thou hast given her a right answer. Then Mercy smiled, but the 
little boy did blush.</P>
<P id=vi.iv-p36><SPAN id=vi.iv-p36.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Come, said Christiana, will 
you eat a bit to sweeten your mouths, while you sit here to rest your legs? for 
I have here a piece of pomegranate which Mr. Interpreter put into my hand just 
when I came out of his door; he gave me also a piece of an honeycomb, and a 
little bottle of spirits. I thought he gave you something, said Mercy, because 
he called you aside. Yes, so he did, said the other; but, said Christiana, it 
shall be still as I said it should, when at first we came from home; thou shalt 
be a sharer in all the good that I have, because thou so willingly didst become 
my companion. Then she gave to them, and they did eat, both Mercy and the boys. 
And said Christiana to Mr. Great-Heart, Sir, will you do as we? But he answered, 
You are going on pilgrimage, and presently I shall return; much good may what 
you have do you: at home I eat the same every day.</P>
<P class=div2>THE FOURTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=vi.v-p0.1><A id=vi.v-p0.2></A>THE FOURTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=vi.v-p1>Now when they had eaten and drank, and had chatted a little 
longer, their guide said to them, The day wears away; if you think good, let us 
prepare to be going. So they got up to go, and the little boys went before; But 
Christiana forgot to take her bottle of spirits with her, so she sent her little 
boy back to fetch it. Then said Mercy, I think this is a losing place: here 
Christian lost his roll, and here Christiana left her bottle behind her. Sir, 
what is the cause of this? So their guide made answer, and said, The cause is 
sleep, or forgetfulness: some sleep when they should keep awake, and some forget 
when they should remember; and this is the very cause why often, at the 
resting-places, some pilgrims in some things come off losers. Pilgrims should 
watch, and remember what they have already received, under their greatest 
enjoyments; but for want of doing so, oftentimes their rejoicing ends in tears, 
and their sunshine in a cloud: witness the story of Christian at this place.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p2>When they were come to the place where Mistrust and Timorous met 
Christian, to persuade him to go back for fear of the lions, they perceived as 
it were a stage, and before it, towards the road, a broad plate with a copy of 
verses written thereon, and underneath the reason of raising up that stage in 
that place rendered. The verses were,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Let him that sees this stage, take heed<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto his heart and tongue;<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Lest, if he do not, 
here he speed<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some have long agone.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.v-p3>The words underneath the verses were, “This stage was built to 
punish those upon, who, through timorousness or mistrust, shall be afraid to go 
further on pilgrimage. Also, on this stage both Mistrust and Timorous were 
burned through the tongue with a hot iron, for endeavoring to hinder Christian 
on his journey.”</P>
<P id=vi.v-p4>Then said Mercy, This is much like to the saying of the Beloved: 
“What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be done unto thee, thou false 
tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. <SCRIPREF

<P id=vi.v-p5>So they went on till they came within sight of the lions. Now Mr. 
Great-Heart was a strong man, so he was not afraid of a lion: But yet when they 
were come up to the place where the lions were, the boys, that went before, were 
now glad to cringe behind, for they were afraid of the lions; so they stepped 
back, and went behind. At this their guide smiled, and said, How now, my boys; 
do you love to go before when no danger doth approach, and love to come behind 
so soon as the lions appear?</P>
<P id=vi.v-p6>Now, as they went on, Mr. Great-heart drew his sword, with intent 
to make a way for the pilgrims in spite of the lions. Then there appeared one 
that, it seems, had taken upon him to back the lions; and he said to the 
pilgrims’ guide, What is the cause of your coming hither? Now the name of that 
man was Grim, or Bloody-man because of his slaying of pilgrims; and he was of 
the race of the giants.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p7><SPAN id=vi.v-p7.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Then said the pilgrims’ guide, These women and children are 
going on pilgrimage, and this is the way they must go; and go it they shall, in

<P id=vi.v-p8><SPAN id=vi.v-p8.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">GRIM:</SPAN> 
This is not their way, neither shall they go therein. I am come forth to 
withstand them, and to that end will back the lions.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p9>Now, to say the truth, by reason of the fierceness of the lions, 
and of the grim carriage of him that did back them, this way had of late lain 
much unoccupied, and was almost grown over with grass.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p10><SPAN id=vi.v-p10.1

<P id=vi.v-p11><SPAN id=vi.v-p11.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">GRIM:</SPAN> 
Then he swore by the lions that it should; and therefore bid them turn aside, 
for they should not have passage there.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p12>But Great-Heart their guide made first his approach unto Grim, 
and laid so heavily on him with his sword that he forced him to retreat.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p13><SPAN id=vi.v-p13.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">GRIM:</SPAN> 
Then said he that attempted to back the lions, Will you slay me upon mine own

<P id=vi.v-p14><SPAN id=vi.v-p14.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> It is the King’s highway that we are in, and in this way it 
is that thou hast placed the lions; but these women, and these children, though 
weak, shall hold on their way in spite of thy lions. And with that he gave him 
again a downright blow, and brought him upon his knees. With this blow also he 
broke his helmet, and with the next he cut off an arm. Then did the giant roar 
so hideously that his voice frightened the women, and yet they were glad to see 
him lie sprawling upon the ground. Now the lions were chained, and so of 
themselves could do nothing. Wherefore, when old Grim, that intended to back 
them, was dead, Mr. Great-Heart said to the pilgrims, Come now, and follow me, 
and no hurt shall happen to you from the lions. They therefore went on, but the 
women trembled as they passed by them; the boys also looked as if they would 
die; but they all got by without further hurt.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p15>Now, when they were within sight of the Porter’s lodge, they soon 
came up unto it; but they made the more haste after this to go thither, because 
it is dangerous traveling there in the night. So when they were come to the 
gate, the guide knocked, and the Porter cried, Who is there? But as soon as the 
guide had said, It is I, he knew his voice, and came down, for the guide had oft 
before that come thither as a conductor of pilgrims. When he was come down, he 
opened the gate; and seeing the guide standing just before it, (for he saw not 
the women, for they were behind him,) he said unto him, How now, Mr. 
Great-Heart, what is your business here so late at night? I have brought, said 
he, some pilgrims hither, where, by my Lord’s commandment, they must lodge: I 
had been here some time ago, had I not been opposed by the giant that did use to 
back the lions. But I, after a long and tedious combat with him, have cut him 
off, and have brought the pilgrims hither in safety.</P>

<P id=vi.v-p22>Then the Porter, Mr. Watchful, asked Christiana of her country,

said the Porter, was he your husband? Yes, said she, and these are his children 
and this, pointing to Mercy, is one of my town’s-women. Then the Porter rang his 
bell, as at such times he is wont, and there come to the door one of the 
damsels, whose name was Humble-Mind; and to her the Porter said, Go tell it 
within, that Christiana, the wife of Christian, and her children, are come 
hither on pilgrimage. She went in, therefore, and told it. But oh, what noise 
for gladness was there within when the damsel did but drop that out of her 
mouth!</P>
<P id=vi.v-p23>So they came with haste to the Porter, for Christana stood still 
at the door. Then some of the most grave said unto her, Come in, Christiana, 
come in, thou wife of that good man; come in, thou blessed woman, come in, with 
all that are with thee. So she went in, and they followed her that were her 
children and companions. Now when they were gone in, they were had into a large 
room, where they were bidden to sit down: so they sat down, and the chief of the 
house were called to see and welcome the guests. Then they came in, and 
understanding who they were, did salute each other with a kiss, and said, 
Welcome, ye vessels of the grace of God; welcome to us, your friends.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p24>Now, because it was somewhat late, and because the pilgrims were 
weary with their journey, and also made faint with the sight of the fight, and 
of the terrible lions, they desired, as soon as might be, to prepare to go to 
rest. Nay, said those of the family, refresh yourselves first with a morsel of 
meat; for they had prepared for them a lamb, with the accustomed sauce belonging 
thereto, <SCRIPREF id=vi.v-p24.1 osisRef="Bible:Exod.12.21"

coming, and had told it to them within. So when they had supped, and ended their 
prayer with a psalm, they desired they might go to rest.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p25>But let us, said Christiana, if we may be so bold as to choose, 
be in that chamber that was my husband’s when he was here; so they had them up 
thither, and they all lay in a room. When they were at rest, Christiana and 
Mercy entered into discourse about things that were convenient.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p26><SPAN id=vi.v-p26.1

when my husband went on pilgrimage, that I should ever have followed him.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p27><SPAN id=vi.v-p27.1

<P id=vi.v-p29><SPAN id=vi.v-p29.1

<P id=vi.v-p30><SPAN id=vi.v-p30.1

they talked a while, and then betook themselves to sleep.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p32>So in the morning when they were awake, Christiana said to Mercy, 
What was the matter that you did laugh in your sleep to-night? I suppose you 
were in a dream.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p33><SPAN id=vi.v-p33.1

was; but are you sure I laughed?</P>
<P id=vi.v-p34><SPAN id=vi.v-p34.1

but prithee, Mercy, tell me thy dream.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p35><SPAN id=vi.v-p35.1

alone in a solitary place, and was bemoaning of the hardness of my heart. Now I 
had not sat there long but methought many were gathered about me to see me, and 
to hear what it was that I said. So they hearkened, and I went on bemoaning the 
hardness of my heart. At this, some of them laughed at me, some called me fool, 
and some began to thrust me about. With that, methought I looked up and saw one 
coming with wings towards me. So he came directly to me, and said, Mercy, what 
aileth thee? Now when he had heard me make my complaint, he said, Peace be to 
thee; he also wiped my eyes with his handkerchief, and clad me in silver and 
gold. <SCRIPREF id=vi.v-p35.2 osisRef="Bible:Ezek.16.8-Ezek.16.11"

a chain about my neck, and ear-rings in mine ears, and a beautiful crown upon my 
head. Then he took me by the hand, and said, Mercy, come after me. So he went 
up, and I followed till we came at a golden gate. Then he knocked; and when they 
within had opened, the man went in, and I followed him up to a throne, upon 
which one sat; and he said to me, Welcome, daughter. The place looked bright and 
twinkling, like the stars, or rather like the sun, and I thought that I saw your 
husband there; so I awoke from my dream. But did I laugh?</P>
<P id=vi.v-p36><SPAN id=vi.v-p36.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Laugh! aye, and well you 
might to see yourself so well. For you must give me leave to tell you that it 
was a good dream; and that, as you have begun to find the first part true, so 
you shall find the second at last. “God speaks once, yea, twice, yet man 
perceiveth it not; in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth 
upon men, in slumberings upon the bed.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.v-p36.2

awake to talk with God; he can visit us while we sleep, and cause us then to 
hear his voice. Our heart oftentimes wakes when we sleep, and God can speak to 
that, either by words, by proverbs, by signs and similitudes, as well as if one 
was awake.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p37><SPAN id=vi.v-p37.1

<P id=vi.v-p40><SPAN id=vi.v-p40.1

<P id=vi.v-p41>So when they were up and ready, they came down, and they asked 
one another of their rest, and if it was comfortable or not.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p42><SPAN id=vi.v-p42.1

<P id=vi.v-p43>Then said Prudence and Piety, If you will be persuaded to stay 
here a while, you shall have what the house will afford.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p44><SPAN id=vi.v-p44.1

and became very profitable one to another. And because Prudence would see how 
Christiana had brought up her children, she asked leave of her to catechise 
them. So she gave her free consent. Then she began with her youngest, whose name 
was James.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p45><SPAN id=vi.v-p45.1

<P id=vi.v-p55>Then said Prudence to Christiana, You are to be commended for 
thus bringing up your children. I suppose I need not ask the rest these

<P id=vi.v-p56><SPAN id=vi.v-p56.1

<P id=vi.v-p64><SPAN id=vi.v-p64.1

<P id=vi.v-p77><SPAN id=vi.v-p77.1

enjoy.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p78><SPAN id=vi.v-p78.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">PRUDENCE:</SPAN> A very good boy, and one that 
has learned well.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p79>Then she addressed herself to the eldest, whose name was Matthew; 
and she said to him, Come, Matthew, shall I also catechise you?</P>
<P id=vi.v-p80><SPAN id=vi.v-p80.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MATTHEW:</SPAN> With a very good will.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p81><SPAN id=vi.v-p81.1

any thing that had a being antecedent to or before God?</P>
<P id=vi.v-p82><SPAN id=vi.v-p82.1

there any thing, excepting himself, that had a being until the beginning of the

in them is.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p83><SPAN id=vi.v-p83.1

<P id=vi.v-p84><SPAN id=vi.v-p84.1

<P id=vi.v-p85><SPAN id=vi.v-p85.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">PRUDENCE:</SPAN> Is there nothing written 
therein but what you understand?</P>
<P id=vi.v-p86><SPAN id=vi.v-p86.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MATTHEW:</SPAN> Yes, a great deal.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p87><SPAN id=vi.v-p87.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">PRUDENCE:</SPAN> What do you do when you meet 
with places therein that you do not understand?</P>
<P id=vi.v-p88><SPAN id=vi.v-p88.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MATTHEW:</SPAN> I think God is wiser than I. I 
pray also that he will please to let me know all therein that he knows will be 
for my good.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p89><SPAN id=vi.v-p89.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">PRUDENCE:</SPAN> How believe you as touching 
the resurrection of the dead?</P>
<P id=vi.v-p90><SPAN id=vi.v-p90.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MATTHEW:</SPAN> I believe they shall rise the 
same that was buried; the same in nature, though not in corruption. And I 
believe this upon a double account: first, because God has promised it; 
secondly, because he is able to perform it.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p91>Then said Prudence to the boys, You must still hearken to your 
mother; for she can teach you more. You must also diligently give ear to what 
good talk you shall hear from others: for your sakes do they speak good things. 
Observe also, and that with carefulness, what the heavens and the earth do teach 
you; but especially be much in the meditation of that book which was the cause 
of your father’s becoming a pilgrim. I, for my part, my children, will teach you 
what I can while you are here, and shall be glad if you will ask me questions 
that tend to godly edifying.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p92>Now by that these pilgrim’s had been at this place a week, Mercy 
had a visitor that pretended some good-will unto her, and his name was Mr. 
Brisk; a man of some breeding, and that pretended to religion, but a man that 
stuck very close to the world. So he came once or twice, or more, to Mercy, and 
offered love unto her. Now Mercy was of a fair countenance, and therefore the 
more alluring.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p93>Her mind also was to be always busying of herself in doing; for 
when she had nothing to do for herself, she would be making hose and garments 
for others, and would bestow them upon those that had need. And Mr. Brisk not 
knowing where or how she disposed of what she made, seemed to be greatly taken, 
for that he found her never idle. I will warrant her a good housewife, quoth he 
to himself.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p94>Mercy then revealed the business to the maidens that were of the 
house, and inquired of them concerning him, for they did know him better than 
she. So they told her that he was a very busy young man, and one who pretended 
to religion, but was, as they feared, a stranger to the power of that which is 
good.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p95>Nay then, said Mercy, I will look no more on him; for I purpose 
never to have a clog to my soul.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p96>Prudence then replied, that there needed no matter of great 
discouragement to be given to him; her continuing so as she had begun to do for 
the poor, would quickly cool his courage.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p97>So the next time he comes he finds her at her old work, making 
things for the poor. Then said he, What, always at it? Yes, said she, either for 
myself or for others. And what canst thou earn a day? said he. I do these 
things, said she, that I may be rich in good works, laying up in store for 
myself a good foundation against the time to come, that I may lay hold on 
eternal life. <SCRIPREF id=vi.v-p97.1 osisRef="Bible:1Tim.6.17-1Tim.6.19" 
parsed="|1Tim|6|17|6|19" passage="1 Ti 6:17-19">1 Tim. 6:17-19</SCRIPREF>. Why, 
prithee, what doest thou with them? said he. Clothe the naked, said she. With 
that his countenance fell. So he forbore to come at her again. And when he was 
asked the reason why, he said, that Mercy was a pretty lass, but troubled with 
ill conditions.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p98>When he had left her, Prudence said, Did I not tell thee that Mr. 
Brisk would soon forsake thee? yea, he will rise up an ill report of thee; for, 
notwithstanding his pretence to religion, and his seeming love to Mercy, yet 
Mercy and he are of tempers so different that I believe they will never come 
together.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p99><SPAN id=vi.v-p99.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> I might have had husbands before 
now, though I spoke not of it to any; but they were such as did not like my

I could not agree.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p100><SPAN id=vi.v-p100.1

by thy conditions, there are but few that can abide.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p101><SPAN id=vi.v-p101.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Well, said Mercy, if nobody will 
have me, I will die unmarried, or my conditions shall be to me as a husband: for 
I cannot change my nature; and to have one who lies cross to me in this, that I 
purpose never to admit of as long as I live. I had a sister named Bountiful, 
that was married to one of these churls, but he and she could never agree; but 
because my sister was resolved to do as she had begun, that is, to show kindness 
to the poor, therefore her husband first cried her down at the cross, and then 
turned her out of his doors.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p102><SPAN id=vi.v-p102.1

such as he the world is now full: but I am for none of them all.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p104>Now Matthew, the eldest son of Christiana, fell sick, and his 
sickness was sore upon him, for he was much pained in his bowels, so that he was 
with it at times pulled, as it were, both ends together. There dwelt also not 
far from thence one Mr. Skill, an ancient and well-approved physician. So 
Christiana desired it, and entered the room, and had a little observed the boy, 
he concluded that he was sick of the gripes. Then he said to his mother, What 
diet has Matthew of late fed upon? Diet! said Christiana, nothing but what is 
wholesome. The physician answered, This boy has been tampering with something 
that lies in his stomach undigested, and that will not away without means. And I 
tell you he must be purged, or else he will die.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p105><SPAN id=vi.v-p105.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">SAMUEL:</SPAN> Then said Samuel, Mother, what 
was that which my brother did gather up and eat as soon as we were come from the 
gate that is at the head of this way? You know that there was an orchard on the 
left hand, on the other side of the wall, and some of the trees hung over the 
wall, and my brother did pluck and eat.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p106><SPAN id=vi.v-p106.1

Christiana, he did take thereof, and did eat: naughty boy as he was, I chid him, 
and yet he would eat thereof.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p107><SPAN id=vi.v-p107.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

that food, to wit, that fruit, is even the most hurtful of all. It is the fruit

thereof.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p108><SPAN id=vi.v-p108.1

<P id=vi.v-p112>When this potion was prepared, and brought to the boy, he was 
loth to take it, though torn with the gripes as if he should be pulled in 
pieces. Come, come, said the physician, you must take it. It goes against my 
stomach, said the boy. I must have you take it, said his mother. I shall vomit 
it up again, said the boy. Pray, sir, said Christiana to Mr. Skill, how does it 
taste? It has no ill taste, said the doctor; and with that she touched one of 
the pills with the tip of her tongue. Oh, Matthew, said she, this potion is 
sweeter than honey. If thou lovest thy mother, if thou lovest thy brothers, if 
thou lovest Mercy, if thou lovest thy life, take it. So, with much ado, after a 
short prayer for the blessing of God upon it, he took it, and it wrought kindly 
with him. It caused him to purge; it caused him to sleep, and to rest quietly; 
it put him into a fine heat and breathing sweat, and did quite rid him of his 
gripes. So in a little time he got up, and walked about with a staff, and would 
go from room to room, and talk with Prudence, Piety, and Charity, of his 
distemper, and how he was healed.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p113>So when the boy was healed, Christiana asked Mr. Skill, saying, 
Sir, what will content you for your pains and care to and of my child? And he 
said, You must pay the master of the College of Physicians, <SCRIPREF

<P id=vi.v-p145>Now about this time their month was out; wherefore they 
signified to those of the house, that it was convenient for them to up and be 
going. Then said Joseph to his mother, It is proper that you forget not to send 
to the house of Mr. Interpreter, to pray him to grant that Mr. Great-Heart 
should be sent unto us, that he may be our conductor for the rest of the way. 
Good boy, said she, I had almost forgot. So she drew up a petition, and prayed 
Mr. Watchful the porter to send it by some fit man to her good friend Mr. 
Interpreter; who, when it was come, and he had seen the contents of the 
petition, said to the messenger, Go, tell them that I will send him.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p146>When the family where Christiana was, saw that they had a 
purpose to go forward, they called the whole house together, to give thanks to 
their King for sending of them such profitable guests as these. Which done, they 
said unto Christiana, And shall we not show thee something, as our custom is to 
do to pilgrims, on which thou mayest meditate when thou art upon the way? So 
they took Christiana, her children, and Mercy, into the closet, and showed them 
one of the apples that Eve ate of, and that she also did give to her husband, 
and that for the eating of which they were both turned out of paradise, and 
asked her what she thought that was. Then Christiana said, It is food or poison, 
I know not which. So they opened the matter to her, and she held up her hands 
and wondered. <SCRIPREF id=vi.v-p146.1 osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.6"

<P id=vi.v-p147>Then they had her to a place, and showed her Jacob’s ladder.

angels ascending upon it. So Christiana looked and looked to see the angels go 
up: so did the rest of the company. Then they were going into another place, to 
show them something else; but James said to his mother, Pray, bid them stay here 
a little longer, for this is a curious sight. So they turned again, and stood 
feeding their eyes with this so pleasant a prospect.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p148>After this, they had them into a place where did hang up a 
golden anchor. So they bid Christiana take it down; for said they, You shall 
have it with you, for it is of absolute necessity that you should, that you may 
lay hold of that within the veil, <SCRIPREF id=vi.v-p148.1 
osisRef="Bible:Heb.6.19" parsed="|Heb|6|19|0|0" passage="Heb 6:19">Heb.

<P id=vi.v-p149>Then they took them, and had them to the mount upon which 
Abraham our father offered up Isaac his son, and showed them the altar, the

<P id=vi.v-p150>After they had showed them all these things, Prudence took them 
into a dining room, where stood a pair of excellent virginals;<A

upon them, and turned what she had showed them into this excellent song, 
saying,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Eve’s apple we have showed you;<SPAN

class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.v-p151>Now, about this time, one knocked at the door; so the Porter 
opened, and behold, Mr. Great-Heart was there. But when he was come in, what joy 
was there! for it came now afresh again into their minds, how but a while ago he 
had slain old Grim Bloody-man the giant, and had delivered them from the 
lions.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p152>Then said Mr. Great-Heart to Christiana and to Mercy, My Lord 
has sent each of you a bottle of wine, and also some parched corn, together with 
a couple of pomegranates; he has also sent the boys some figs and raisins; to 
refresh you in your way.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p153>Then they addressed themselves to their journey, and Prudence 
and Piety went along with them. When they came to the gate, Christiana asked the 
Porter if any of late went by. He said, No; only one, some time since, who also 
told me, that of late there had been a great robbery committed on the King’s 
highway as you go. But, said he, the thieves are taken, and will shortly be 
tried for their lives. Then Christiana and Mercy were afraid; but Matthew said, 
Mother, fear nothing, as long as Mr. Great-Heart is to go with us, and to be our 
conductor.</P>
<P id=vi.v-p154>Then said Christiana to the Porter, Sir, I am much obliged to 
you for all the kindnesses that you have showed to me since I came hither; and 
also for that you have been so loving and kind to my children. I know not how to 
gratify your kindness; wherefore, pray, as a token of my respect to you, accept 
of this small mite. So she put a gold angel<A style="mso-footnote-id: ftn9"

and he made her a low obeisance, and said, “Let thy garments be always white; 
and let thy head want no ointment.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.v-p154.2

<P class=div2>THE FIFTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=vi.vi-p0.1><A id=vi.vi-p0.2></A>THE FIFTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=vi.vi-p1>Now I saw in my dream, that they went forward until they were 
come to the brow of the Hill; where Piety, bethinking herself, cried out, Alas, 
I have forgot what I intended to bestow upon Christiana and her companions: I 
will go back and fetch it. So she ran and fetched it. While she was gone, 
Christiana thought she heard, in a grove a little way off on the right hand, a 
most curious melodious note, with words much like these:</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Through all my 
life thy favor is<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So frankly showed to me,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>That in thy House 
for evermore<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dwelling-place shall be.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.vi-p2>And listening still, she thought she heard another answer it, 
saying,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“For why? The Lord our God is good;<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mercy is forever sure;<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>His truth at all 
times firmly stood,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shall from age to age 
endure.”<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.vi-p3>So Christiana asked Prudence who it was that made those curious 
notes. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vi-p3.1 osisRef="Bible:Song.2.11 Bible:Song.2.12" 
parsed="|Song|2|11|0|0;|Song|2|12|0|0" passage="SS 2:11,12">Song 
2:11,12</SCRIPREF>. They are, answered she, our country birds: they sing these 
notes but seldom, except it be at the spring, when the flowers appear, and the 
sun shines warm, and then you may hear them all day long. I often, said she, go 
out to hear them; we also oft-times keep them tame in our house. They are very 
fine company for us when we are melancholy: also they make the woods, and 
groves, and solitary places, places desirable to be in.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p4>By this time Piety was come again. So she said to Christiana, 
Look here, I have brought thee a scheme of all those things that thou hast seen 
at our house, upon which thou mayest look when thou findest thyself forgetful, 
and call those things again to remembrance for thy edification and comfort.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p5>Now they began to go down the hill into the Valley of 
Humiliation. It was a steep hill, and the way was slippery; but they were very 
careful; so they got down pretty well. When they were down in the valley, Piety 
said to Christiana, This is the place where Christian your husband met, with the 
foul fiend Apollyon, and where they had that dreadful fight that they had: I 
know you cannot but have heard thereof. But be of good courage; as long as you 
have here Mr. Great-Heart to be your guide and conductor, we hope you will fare 
the better. So when these two had committed the pilgrims unto the conduct of 
their guide, he went forward, and they went after.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p6><SPAN id=vi.vi-p6.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Then said Mr. Great-Heart, We need not be so afraid of this 
valley, for here is nothing to hurt us, unless we procure it to ourselves. It is 
true, Christian did here meet with Apollyon, with whom he had also a sore 
combat: but that fray was the fruit of those slips that he got in his going down 
the hill: for they that get slips there, must look for combats here. And hence 
it is, that this valley has got so hard a name. For the common people, when they 
hear that some frightful thing has befallen such an one in such a place, are of 
opinion that that place is haunted with some foul fiend, or evil spirit; when, 
alas! it is for the fruit of their doing, that such things do befal them there. 
This Valley of Humiliation is of itself as fruitful a place as any the crow 
flies over; and I am persuaded, if we could hit upon it, we might find somewhere 
hereabouts something that might give us an account why Christian was so hardly 
beset in this place.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p7>Then said James to his mother, Lo, yonder stands a pillar, and it 
looks as if something was written thereon; let us go and see what it is. So they 
went and found there written, “Let Christian’s slips, before he came hither, and 
the battles that he met with in this place, be a warning to those that come 
after.” Lo, said their guide, did not I tell you that there was something 
hereabouts that would give intimation of the reason why Christian was so hard 
beset in this place? Then turning to Christiana, he said, No disparagement to 
Christian more than to any others whose hap and lot it was. For it is easier 
going up than down this hill, and that can be said but of few hills in all these 
parts of the world. But we will leave the good man; he is at rest: he also had a 
brave victory over his enemy. Let Him grant, that dwelleth above, that we fare 
no worse, when we come be tried, than he.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p8>But we will come again to this Valley of Humiliation. It is the 
best and most fruitful piece of ground in all those parts. It is fat ground, and 
as you see, consisteth much in meadows; and if a man was to come here in the 
summer-time, as we do now, if he knew not any thing before thereof, and if he 
also delighted himself in the sight of his eyes, he might see that which would 
be delightful to him. Behold how green this valley is; also how beautified with 
lillies. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vi-p8.1 osisRef="Bible:Song.2.1" parsed="|Song|2|1|0|0" 
passage="SS 2:1">Song 2:1</SCRIPREF>. I have known many laboring men that have

<P id=vi.vi-p9>Now, as they were going along, and talking, they espied a boy 
feeding his father’s sheep. The boy was in very mean clothes, but of a very 
fresh and well-favored countenance; and as he sat by himself, he sung. Hark, 
said Mr. Great-Heart, to what the shepherd’s boy saith. So they hearkened and he 
said,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN

<P id=vi.vi-p10>Then said the guide, Do you hear him? I will dare to say, that 
this boy lives a merrier life, and wears more of that herb called heart’s-ease 
in his bosom, than he that is clad in silk and velvet. But we will proceed in 
our discourse.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p11>In this valley our Lord formerly had his country-house: he loved 
much to be here. He loved also to walk these meadows, for he found the air was 
pleasant. Besides, here a man shall be free from the noise, and from the 
hurryings of this life: all states are full of noise and confusion; only the 
Valley of Humiliation is that empty and solitary place. Here a man shall not be 
so let and hindered in his contemplation as in other places he is apt to be. 
This is a valley that nobody walks in but those that love a pilgrim’s life. And 
though Christian had the hard hap to meet here with Apollyon, and to enter with 
him in a brisk encounter, yet I must tell you, that in former times men have met 
with angels here, <SCRIPREF id=vi.vi-p11.1

<P id=vi.vi-p12>Did I say our Lord had here in former days his country-house, 
and that he loved here to walk? I will add-in this place, and to the people that 
love and trace these grounds, he has left a yearly revenue, to be faithfully 
paid them at certain seasons, for their maintenance by the way, and for their 
further encouragement to go on in their pilgrimage.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p13><SPAN id=vi.vi-p13.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">SAMUEL:</SPAN> Now, as they went on, Samuel 
said to Mr. Great-Heart, Sir, I perceive that in this valley my father and 
Apollyon had their battle; but whereabout was the fight? for I perceive this 
valley is large.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p14><SPAN id=vi.vi-p14.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Your father had the battle with Apollyon at a place yonder 
before us, in a narrow passage, just beyond Forgetful Green. And indeed that 
place is the most dangerous place in all these parts. For if at any time 
pilgrims meet with any brunt, it is when they forget what favours they have 
received, and how unworthy they are of them. This is the place also where others 
have been hard put to it. But more of the place when we are come to it; for I 
persuade myself that to this day there remains either some sign of the battle, 
or some monument to testify that such a battle there was fought.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p15><SPAN id=vi.vi-p15.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MERCY:</SPAN> Then said Mercy, I think I am as 
well in this valley as I have been anywhere else in all our journey: the place, 
methinks, suits with my spirit. I love to be in such places, where there is no 
rattling with coaches, nor rumbling with wheels. Methinks, here one may, without 
much molestation, be thinking what he is, whence he came, what he has done, and 
to what the King has called him. Here one may think, and break at heart, and 
melt in one’s spirit, until one’s eyes become as the fish-pools in Heshbon.

<P id=vi.vi-p16><SPAN id=vi.vi-p16.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> ‘Tis true, said their guide; I have gone through this valley 
many a time, and never was better than when here. I have also been a conduct to 
several pilgrims, and they have confessed the same. “To this man will I look,” 
saith the King, “even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and 
trembleth at my word.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.vi-p16.2 osisRef="Bible:Isa.66.2" 
parsed="|Isa|66|2|0|0" passage="Isa 66:2">Isa. 66:2</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p17>Now they were come to the place where the aforementioned battle 
was fought: Then said the guide to Christiana, her children, and Mercy, This is 
the place; on this ground Christian stood, and up there came Apollyon against 
him; and look. And, look, did I not tell you? here is some of your husband’s 
blood upon these stones to this day: Behold, also, how here and there are yet to 
be seen upon the place, some of the shivers of Apollyon’s broken darts. See, 
also, how they did beat the ground with their feet as they fought, to make good 
their places against each other; how also with their by-blows they did split the 
very stones in pieces. Verily, Christian did here play the man, and showed 
himself as stout as Hercules could, had he been there, even he himself. When 
Apollyon was beat, he made his retreat to the next valley, that is called, the 
Valley of the Shadow of Death, unto which we shall come anon. Lo, yonder also 
stands a monument, on which is engraven this battle, and Christian’s victory, to 
his fame, throughout all ages: So because it stood just on the way-side before 
them, they stepped to it, and read the writing, which word for word was 
this:</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“Hard by here was a battle fought,<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most strange, and yet most 
true;<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Christian 
and Apollyon fought<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each other to subdue.<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>The man so 
bravely play’d the man,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the fiend to fly;<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Of which a monument 
I stand,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same to testify.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.vi-p18>When they had passed by this place, they came upon the borders 
of the Shadow of Death. This Valley was longer than the other; a place also most 
strangely haunted with evil things, as many are able to testify: but these women 
and children went the better through it, because they had daylight, and because 
Mr. Great-Heart was their conductor.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p19>When they were entering upon this valley, they thought they 
heard a groaning, as of dying men; a very great groaning. They thought also that 
they did hear words of lamentation, spoken as of some in extreme torment. These 
things made the boys to quake; the women also looked pale and wan; but their 
guide bid them be of good comfort.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p20>So they went on a little further, and they thought that they 
felt the ground begin to shake under them, as if some hollow place was there: 
they heard also a kind of hissing, as of serpents, but nothing as yet appeared. 
Then said the boys, Are we not yet at the end of this doleful place? But the 
guide also bid them be of good courage, and look well to their feet; lest haply, 
said he, you be taken in some snare.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p21>Now James began to be sick; but I think the cause thereof was 
fear: so his mother gave him some of that glass of spirits that had been given 
her at the Interpreter’s house, and three of the pills that Mr. Skill had 
prepared, and the boy began to revive. Thus they went on till they came to about 
the middle of the valley; and then Christiana said, Methinks I see something 
yonder upon the road before us, a thing of a shape such as I have not seen. Then 
said Joseph, Mother, what is it? An ugly thing, child; an ugly thing, said she. 
But, mother, what is it like? said he. ‘Tis like I cannot tell what, said she; 
and now it is but a little way off. Then said she, It is nigh.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p22>Well, said Mr. Great-Heart, let them that are most afraid keep 
close to me. So the fiend came on, and the conductor met it; but when it was 
come to him, it vanished to all their sights. Then remembered they what had been 
said some time ago: “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.” <SCRIPREF 
id=vi.vi-p22.1 osisRef="Bible:Jas.4.7" parsed="|Jas|4|7|0|0" 
passage="Jas 4:7">James 4:7</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p23>They went therefore on, as being a little refreshed. But they 
had not gone far, before Mercy, looking behind her, saw, as she thought, 
something most like a lion, and it came at a great padding pace after: and it 
had a hollow voice of roaring; and at every roar it gave, it made the valley 
echo, and all their hearts to ache, save the heart of him that was their guide. 
So it came up and Mr. Great-Heart went behind, and put the pilgrims all before 
him. The lion also came on apace, and Mr. Great-Heart addressed himself to give 
him battle. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vi-p23.1 osisRef="Bible:1Pet.5.8 Bible:1Pet.5.9" 
parsed="|1Pet|5|8|0|0;|1Pet|5|9|0|0" passage="1 Pe 5:8,9">1 Pet. 
5:8,9</SCRIPREF>. But when he saw that it was determined that resistance should 
be made, he also drew back, and came no further.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p24>Then they went on again, and their conductor went before them, 
till they came to a place where was cast up a pit the whole breadth of the way; 
and before they could be prepared to go over that, a great mist and a darkness 
fell upon them, so that they could not see. Then said the pilgrims, Alas! what 
now shall we do? But their guide made answer, Fear not; stand still, and see 
what an end will be put to this also; so they stayed there, because their path 
was marred. They then also thought that they did hear more apparently the noise 
and rushing of the enemies; the fire also and the smoke of the pit were much 
easier to be discerned. Then said Christiana to Mercy, Now I see what my poor 
husband went through. I have heard much of this place, but I never was here 
before now. Poor man! he went here all alone in the night; he had night almost 
quite through the way: also these fiends were busy about him, as if they would 
have torn him in pieces. Many have spoken of it; but none can tell what the 
Valley of the Shadow of Death should mean until they come in themselves. The 
heart knoweth its own bitterness; and a stranger intermeddleth not with its joy. 
<SCRIPREF id=vi.vi-p24.1 osisRef="Bible:Prov.14.10" parsed="|Prov|14|10|0|0" 
passage="Pr 14:10">Prov. 14:10</SCRIPREF>. To be here is a fearful thing.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p25><SPAN id=vi.vi-p25.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> This is like doing business in great waters, or like going 
down into the deep. This is like being in the heart of the sea, and like going 
down to the bottoms of the mountains. Now it seems as if the earth, with its 
bars, were about us for ever. But let them that walk in darkness, and have no 
light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon their God. <SCRIPREF 
id=vi.vi-p25.2 osisRef="Bible:Isa.50.10" parsed="|Isa|50|10|0|0" 
passage="Isa 50:10">Isa. 50:10</SCRIPREF>. For my part, as I have told you 
already, I have gone often through this valley, and have been much harder put to 
it than now I am: and yet you see I am alive. I would not boast, for that I am 
not mine own saviour; but I trust we shall have a good deliverance. Come, let us 
pray for light to Him that can lighten our darkness, and that can rebuke not 
only these, but all the Satans in hell.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p26>So they cried and prayed, and God sent light and deliverance, 
for there was now no let in their way; no, not there where but now they were 
stopped with a pit. Yet they were not got through the valley. So they went on 
still, and met with great stinks and loathsome smells, to the great annoyance of 
them. Then said Mercy to Christiana, It is not so pleasant being here as at the 
gate, or at the Interpreter’s, or at the house where we lay last.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p27>O but, said one of the boys, it is not so bad to go through 
here, as it is to abide here, always; and for aught I know, one reason why we 
must go this way to the house prepared for us is, that our home might be the 
sweeter to us.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p28>Well said, Samuel, quoth the guide; thou hast now spoke like a 
man. Why, if ever I get out here again, said the boy, I think I shall prize 
light and good way better than I ever did in all my life. Then said the guide, 
We shall be out by and by.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p29>So on they went, and Joseph said, Cannot we see to the end of 
this valley as yet? Then said the guide, Look to your feet, for we shall 
presently be among the snares: so they looked to their feet, and went on; but 
they were troubled much with the snares. Now, when they were come among the 
snares, they espied a man cast into the ditch on the left hand, with his flesh 
all rent and torn. Then said the guide, That is one Heedless, that was going 
this way: he has lain there a great while. There was one Take-Heed with him when 
he was taken and slain, but he escaped their hands. You cannot imagine how many 
are killed hereabouts, and yet men are so foolishly venturous as to set out 
lightly on pilgrimage, and to come without a guide. Poor Christian! it was a 
wonder that he here escaped; but he was beloved of his God: also he had a good 
heart of his own, or else he could never have done it.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p30>Now they drew towards the end of this way; and just there where 
Christian had seen the cave when he went by, out thence came forth Maul, a 
giant. This Maul did use to spoil young pilgrims with sophistry; and he called 
Great-Heart by his name, and said unto him, How many times have you been 
forbidden to do these things? Then said Mr. Great-Heart, What things? What 
things! quoth the giant; you know what things: but I will put an end to your 
trade.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p31>But, pray, said Mr. Great-Heart, before we fall to it, let us 
understand wherefore we must fight. Now the women and children stood trembling, 
and knew not what to do. Quoth the giant, You rob the country, and rob it with 
the worst of thefts. These are but generals, said Mr. Great-Heart; come to 
particulars, man.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p32>Then said the giant, Thou practisest the craft of a kidnapper; 
thou gatherest up women and children, and carriest them into a strange country, 
to the weakening of my master’s kingdom. But now Great-Heart replied, I am a 
servant of the God of heaven; my business is to persuade sinners to repentance. 
I am commanded to do my endeavors to turn men, women, and children, from 
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; and if this be indeed 
the ground of thy quarrel, let us fall to it as soon as thou wilt.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p33>Then the giant came up, and Mr. Great-Heart went to meet him; 
and as he went he drew his sword, but the giant had a club. So without more ado 
they fell to it, and at the first blow the giant struck Mr. Great-Heart down 
upon one of his knees. With that the women and children cried out. So Mr. 
Great-Heart recovering himself, laid about him in full lusty manner, and gave 
the giant a wound in his arm. Thus he fought for the space of an hour, to that 
height of heat that the breath came out of the giant’s nostrils as the heat doth 
out of a boiling cauldron.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p34>Then they sat down to rest them; but Mr. Great-Heart betook 
himself to prayer. Also the women and children did nothing but sigh and cry all 
the time that the battle did last.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p35>When they had rested them, and taken breath, they both fell to 
it again; and Mr. Great-Heart, with a blow, fetched the giant down to the 
ground. Nay, hold, let me recover, quoth he: so Mr. Great-Heart fairly let him 
get up. So to it they went again, and the giant missed but little of all to 
breaking Mr. Great-Heart’s scull with his club.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p36>Mr. Great-Heart seeing that, runs to him in the full heat of his 
spirit, and pierceth him under the fifth rib. With that the giant began to 
faint, and could hold up his club no longer. Then Mr. Great-Heart seconded his 
blow, and smit the head of the giant from his shoulders. Then the women and 
children rejoiced, and Mr. Great-Heart also praised God for the deliverance he 
had wrought.</P>
<P id=vi.vi-p37>When this was done, they amongst them erected a pillar, and 
fastened the giant’s head thereon, and wrote under in letters that passengers 
might read,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“He that did wear this head was one<SPAN

<H2 id=vi.vii-p0.1><A id=vi.vii-p0.2></A>THE SIXTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=vi.vii-p1>Now I saw that they went on to the ascent that was a little way 
off, cast up to be a prospect for pilgrims. That was the place from whence 
Christian had the first sight of Faithful his brother. Wherefore, here they sat 
down and rested. They also here did eat and drink, and make merry, for that they 
had gotten deliverance from this so dangerous an enemy. As they sat thus and did 
eat, Christiana asked the guide, if he had caught no hurt in the battle? Then 
said Mr. Great-Heart, No, save a little on my flesh; yet that also shall be so 
far from being to my detriment, that it is at present a proof of my love to my 
master and you, and shall be a means, by grace, to increase my reward at 
last.</P>

<P id=vi.vii-p7>Now a little before them stood an oak; and under it, when they

but, now I look better about me, I perceive you are honester people.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p11><SPAN id=vi.vii-p11.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Why, what would or could you have done to have helped 
yourself, if indeed we had been of that company?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p12><SPAN id=vi.vii-p12.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Done! Why, I would have fought as long as breath had been in me: 
and had I so done, I am sure you could never have given me the worst on’t; for a 
Christian can never be overcome, unless he shall yield of himself.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p13><SPAN id=vi.vii-p13.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Well said, father Honest, quoth the guide; for by this I 
know thou art a cock of the right kind, for thou hast said the truth.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p14><SPAN id=vi.vii-p14.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> And by this also I know that thou knowest what true pilgrimage 
is; for all others do think that we are the soonest overcome of any.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p15><SPAN id=vi.vii-p15.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Well, now we are so happily met, pray let me crave your 
name, and the name of the place you came from.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p16><SPAN id=vi.vii-p16.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> My name I cannot tell you, but I came from the town of Stupidity: 
it lieth about four degrees beyond the city of Destruction.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p17><SPAN id=vi.vii-p17.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Oh, Are you that countryman? Then I deem I have half a guess 
of you: your name is Old Honesty, is it not?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p18><SPAN id=vi.vii-p18.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> So the old gentleman blushed, and said, Not honesty in the 
abstract, but Honest is my name; and I wish that my nature may agree to what I 
am called. But, sir, said the old gentleman, how could you guess that I am such 
a man, since I came from such a place?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p19><SPAN id=vi.vii-p19.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> I had heard of you before, by my Master; for he knows all 
things that are done on the earth. But I have often wondered that any should 
come from your place; for your town is worse than is the city of Destruction 
itself.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p20><SPAN id=vi.vii-p20.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Yes, we lie more off from the sun, and so are more cold and 
senseless. But were a man in a mountain of ice, yet if the Sun of righteousness 
will arise upon him, his frozen heart shall feel a thaw; and thus it has been 
with me.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p21><SPAN id=vi.vii-p21.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> I believe it, father Honest, I believe it; for I know the 
thing is true.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p22>Then the old gentleman saluted all the pilgrims with a holy 
kiss of charity, and asked them their names, and how they had fared since they 
set out on their pilgrimage.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p23><SPAN id=vi.vii-p23.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Then said Christiana, My 
name I suppose you have heard of; good Christian was my husband, and these four 
are his children. But can you think how the old gentleman was taken, when she 
told him who she was? He skipped, he smiled, he blessed them with a thousand 
good wishes, saying,</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p24><SPAN id=vi.vii-p24.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> I have heard much of your husband, and of his travels and wars 
which he underwent in his days. Be it spoken to your comfort, the name of your 
husband rings all over these parts of the world: his faith, his courage, his 
enduring, and his sincerity under all, had made his name famous. Then he turned 
him to the boys, and asked them of their names, which they told him. Then said 
he unto them, Matthew, be thou like Matthew the publican, not in vice, but in 
virtue. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p24.2 osisRef="Bible:Matt.10.3"

osisRef="Bible:Acts.1.13" parsed="|Acts|1|13|0|0" passage="Ac 1:13">Acts 
1:13</SCRIPREF>. Then they told him of Mercy, and how she had left her town and 
her kindred to come along with Christiana and with her sons. At that the old 
honest man said, Mercy is thy name: by mercy shalt thou be sustained and carried 
through all those difficulties that shall assault thee in thy way, till thou 
shalt come thither where thou shalt look the Fountain of mercy in the face with 
comfort. All this while the guide, Mr. Great-Heart, was very well pleased, and 
smiled upon his companions.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p25>Now, as they walked along together, the guide asked the old 
gentleman if he did not know one Mr. Fearing, that came on pilgrimage out of his 
parts.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p26><SPAN id=vi.vii-p26.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Yes, very well, said he. He was a man that had the root of the 
matter in him; but he was one of the most troublesome pilgrims that ever I met 
with in all my days.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p27><SPAN id=vi.vii-p27.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> I perceive you knew him, for you have given a very right 
character of him.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p28><SPAN id=vi.vii-p28.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Knew him! I was a great companion of his; I was with him most an

with him.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p29><SPAN id=vi.vii-p29.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> I was his guide from my Master’s house to the gates of the 
Celestial City.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p30><SPAN id=vi.vii-p30.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Then you knew him to be a troublesome one.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p31><SPAN id=vi.vii-p31.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> I did so; but I could very well bear it; for men of my 
calling are oftentimes intrusted with the conduct of such as he was.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p32><SPAN id=vi.vii-p32.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Well then, pray let us hear a little of him, and how he managed 
himself under your conduct.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p33><SPAN id=vi.vii-p33.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Why, he was always afraid that he should come short of 
whither he had a desire to go. Every thing frightened him that he heard any body 
speak of, if it had but the least appearance of opposition in it. I heard that 
he lay roaring at the Slough of Despond for above a month together; nor durst 
he, for all he saw several go over before him, venture, though they many of them 
offered to lend him their hands. He would not go back again, neither. The 
Celestial City-he said he should die if he came not to it; and yet he was 
dejected at every difficulty, and stumbled at every straw that any body cast in 
his way. Well, after he had lain at the Slough of Despond a great while, as I 
have told you, one sunshiny morning, I do not know how, he ventured, and so got 
over; but when he was over, he would scarce believe it. He had, I think, a 
Slough of Despond in his mind, a slough that he carried every where with him, or 
else he could never have been as he was. So he came up to the gate, you know 
what I mean, that stands at the head of this way, and there also he stood a good 
while before he would venture to knock. When the gate was opened, he would give 
back, and give place to others, and say that he was not worthy. For, all he got 
before some to the gate, yet many of them went in before him. There the poor man 
would stand shaking and shrinking; I dare say it would have pitied one’s heart 
to have seen him. Nor would he go back again. At last he took the hammer that 
hanged on the gate, in his hand, and gave a small rap or two; then one opened to 
him, but he shrunk back as before. He that opened stepped out after him, and 
said, Thou trembling one, what wantest thou? With that he fell down to the 
ground. He that spoke to him wondered to see him so faint, so he said to him, 
Peace be to thee; up, for I have set open the door to thee; come in, for thou 
art blessed. With that he got up, and went in trembling; and when he was in, he 
was ashamed to show his face. Well, after he had been entertained there a while, 
as you know how the manner is, he was bid go on his way, and also told the way 
he should take. So he went on till he came out to our house; but as he behaved 
himself at the gate, so he did at my Master the Interpreter’s door. He lay there 
about in the cold a good while, before he would adventure to call; yet he would 
not go back: and the nights were long and cold then. Nay, he had a note of 
necessity in his bosom to my master to receive him, and grant him the comfort of 
his house, and also to allow him a stout and valiant conductor, because he was 
himself so chicken-hearted a man; and yet for all that he was afraid to call at 
the door. So he lay up and down thereabouts, till, poor man, he was almost 
starved; yea, so great was his dejection, that though he saw several others for 
knocking get in, yet he was afraid to venture. At last, I think I looked out of 
the window, and perceiving a man to be up and down about the door, I went out to 
him, and asked what he was: but, poor man, the water stood in his eyes; so I 
perceived what he wanted. I went therefore in, and told it in the house, and we 
showed the thing to our Lord: so he sent me out again, to entreat him to come 
in; but I dare say, I had hard work to do it. At last he came in; and I will say 
that for my Lord, he carried it wonderful lovingly to him. There were but a few 
good bits at the table, but some of it was laid upon his trencher. Then he 
presented the note; and my Lord looked thereon, and said his desire should be 
granted. So when he had been there a good while, he seemed to get some heart, 
and to be a little more comfortable. For my Master, you must know, is one of 
very tender bowels, especially to them that are afraid; wherefore he carried it 
so towards him as might tend most to his encouragement. Well, when he had had a 
sight of the things of the place, and was ready to take his journey to go to the 
city, my Lord, as he did to Christian before, gave him a bottle of spirits, and 
some comfortable things to eat. Thus we set forward, and I went before him; but 
the man was but of few words, only he would sigh aloud.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p34>When we were come to where the three fellows were hanged, he 
said that he doubted that that would be his end also. Only he seemed glad when 
he saw the cross and the sepulchre. There I confess he desired to stay a little 
to look; and he seemed for a while after to be a little cheery. When he came to 
the Hill Difficulty, he made no stick at that, nor did he much fear the lions: 
for you must know, that his troubles were not about such things as these; his 
fear was about his acceptance at last.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p35>I got him in at the house Beautiful, I think, before he was 
willing. Also, when he was in, I brought him acquainted with the damsels of the 
place; but he was ashamed to make himself much in company. He desired much to be 
alone; yet he always loved good talk, and often would get behind the screen to 
hear it. He also loved much to see ancient things, and to be pondering them in 
his mind. He told me afterward, that he loved to be in those two houses from 
which he came last, to wit, at the gate, and that of the Interpreter, but that 
he durst not be so bold as to ask.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p36>When we went also from the house Beautiful, down the hill, into 
the Valley of Humiliation, he went down as well as ever I saw a man in my life; 
for he cared not how mean he was, so he might be happy at last. Yea, I think 
there was a kind of sympathy betwixt that Valley and him; for I never saw him 
better in all his pilgrimage than he was in that Valley.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p37>Here he would lie down, embrace the ground, and kiss the very 
flowers that grew in this valley. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p37.1 
osisRef="Bible:Lam.3.27-Lam.3.29" parsed="|Lam|3|27|3|29" 
passage="La 3:27-29">Lam. 3:27-29</SCRIPREF>. He would now be up every morning 
by break of day, tracing and walking to and fro in the valley.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p38>But when he was come to the entrance of the Valley of the 
Shadow of Death, I thought I should have lost my man: not for that he had any 
inclination to go back; that he always abhorred; but he was ready to die for 
fear. Oh, the hobgoblins will have me! the hobgoblins will have me! cried he; 
and I could not beat him out of it. He made such a noise, and such an outcry 
here, that had they but heard him, it was enough to encourage them to come and 
fall upon us.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p39>But this I took very great notice of, that this valley was as 
quiet when we went through it, as ever I knew it before or since. I suppose 
those enemies here had now a special check from our Lord, and a command not to 
meddle until Mr. Fearing had passed over it.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p40>It would be too tedious to tell you of all; we will therefore 
only mention a passage or two more. When he was come to Vanity Fair, I thought 
he would have fought with all the men in the fair. I feared there we should have 
been both knocked on the head, so hot was he against their fooleries. Upon the 
Enchanted Ground he was very wakeful. But when he was come at the river where 
was no bridge, there again he was in a heavy case. Now, now, he said, he should 
be drowned forever, and so never see that face with comfort that he had come so 
many miles to behold.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p41>And here also I took notice of what was very remarkable: the 
water of that river was lower at this time than ever I saw it in all my life; so 
he went over at last, not much above wetshod. When he was going up to the gate, 
I began to take leave of him, and to wish him a good reception above. So he 
said, I shall, I shall. Then parted we asunder, and I saw him no more.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p42><SPAN id=vi.vii-p42.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p43><SPAN id=vi.vii-p43.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Yes, yes, I never had doubt about him. He was a man of a 
choice spirit, only he was always kept very low, and that made his life so 
burdensome to himself, and so troublesome to others. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p43.2 
osisRef="Bible:Ps.88.1" parsed="|Ps|88|1|0|0" passage="Ps 88:1">Psa.

injuries to others, that he often would deny himself of that which was lawful, 
because he would not offend. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p43.3 osisRef="Bible:Rom.14.21"

<P id=vi.vii-p44><SPAN id=vi.vii-p44.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

his days so much in the dark?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p45><SPAN id=vi.vii-p45.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> There are two sorts of reasons for it. One is, the wise God 
will have it so: some must pipe, and some must weep. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p45.2 
osisRef="Bible:Matt.11.16" parsed="|Matt|11|16|0|0" passage="Mt 11:16">Matt. 
11:16</SCRIPREF>. Now Mr. Fearing was one that played upon the bass. He and his 
fellows sound the sackbut, whose notes are more doleful than the notes of other 
music are: though indeed, some say, the bass is the ground of music. And for my 
part, I care not at all for that profession which begins not in heaviness of 
mind. The first string that the musician usually touches is the bass, when he 
intends to put all in tune. God also plays upon this string first, when he sets 
the soul in tune for himself. Only there was the imperfection of Mr. Fearing; he 
could play upon no other music but this till towards his latter end.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p46>[I make bold to talk thus metaphorically for the ripening of

<P id=vi.vii-p47><SPAN id=vi.vii-p47.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> He was a very zealous man, as one may see by the relation you 
have given of him. Difficulties, lions, or Vanity Fair, he feared not at all; it 
was only sin, death, and hell, that were to him a terror, because he had some 
doubts about his interest in that celestial country.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p48><SPAN id=vi.vii-p48.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> You say right; those were the things that were his 
troublers; and they, as you</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p49>have well observed, arose from the weakness of his mind 
thereabout, not from weakness of spirit as to the practical part of a pilgrim’s 
life. I dare believe that, as the proverb is, he could have bit a firebrand, had 
it stood in his way; but the things with which he was oppressed, no man ever yet 
could shake off with ease.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p50><SPAN id=vi.vii-p50.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">CHRISTIANA:</SPAN> Then said Christiana, This 
relation of Mr. Fearing has done me good; I thought nobody had been like me. But 
I see there was some semblance betwixt this good man and me: only we differed in 
two things. His troubles were so great that they broke out; but mine I kept 
within. His also lay so hard upon him, they made him that he could not knock at 
the houses provided for entertainment; but my trouble was always such as made me 
knock the louder.</P>

must say that something of him has also dwelt in me. For I have ever been more 
afraid of the lake, and the loss of a place in paradise, than I have been of the

there! ‘Tis enough, though I part with all the world to win it.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p52><SPAN id=vi.vii-p52.1

not also go well with me?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p53><SPAN id=vi.vii-p53.1

<P id=vi.vii-p54><SPAN id=vi.vii-p54.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Well said, James; thou hast hit the mark. For the fear of 
God is the beginning of wisdom; and to be sure, they that want the beginning 
have neither middle nor end. But we will here conclude our discourse of Mr. 
Fearing, after we have sent after him this farewell.</P><SPAN

<P id=vi.vii-p55>Now I saw that they still went on in their talk. For after Mr. 
Great-Heart had made an end with Mr. Fearing, Mr. Honest began to tell them of 
another, but his name was Mr. Self-will. He pretended himself to be a pilgrim, 
said Mr. Honest; but I persuade myself he never came in at the gate that stands 
at the head of the way.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p56><SPAN id=vi.vii-p56.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p57><SPAN id=vi.vii-p57.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Yes, more than once or twice; but he would always be like 
himself, self-willed. He neither cared for man, nor argument, nor yet example; 
what his mind prompted him to, that he would do, and nothing else could he be 
got to do.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p58><SPAN id=vi.vii-p58.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

tell.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p59><SPAN id=vi.vii-p59.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> He held that a man might follow the vices as well as the virtues 
of pilgrims; and that if he did both, he should be certainly saved.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p60><SPAN id=vi.vii-p60.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> How? If he had said, it is possible for the best to be 
guilty of the vices, as well as to partake of the virtues of pilgrims, he could 
not much have been blamed; for indeed we are exempted from no vice absolutely, 
but on condition that we watch and strive. But this, I perceive, is not the 
thing; but if I understand you right, your meaning is, that he was of opinion 
that it was allowable so to be.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p61><SPAN id=vi.vii-p61.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p62><SPAN id=vi.vii-p62.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p63><SPAN id=vi.vii-p63.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Why, he said he had the Scripture for his warrant.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p64><SPAN id=vi.vii-p64.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p65><SPAN id=vi.vii-p65.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> So I will. He said, to have to do with other men’s wives had been 
practised by David, God’s beloved; and therefore he could do it. He said, to 
have more women than one was a thing that Solomon practised, and therefore he 
could do it. He said, that Sarah and the godly midwives of Egypt lied, and so 
did save Rahab, and therefore he could do it. He said, that the disciples went 
at the bidding of their Master, and took away the owner’s ass, and therefore he 
could do so too. He said, that Jacob got the inheritance of his father in a way 
of guile and dissimulation, and therefore he could do so too.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p66><SPAN id=vi.vii-p66.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p67><SPAN id=vi.vii-p67.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> I heard him plead for it, bring Scripture for it, bring arguments 
for it, etc.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p68><SPAN id=vi.vii-p68.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> An opinion that is not fit to be with any allowance in the 
world!</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p69><SPAN id=vi.vii-p69.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> You must understand me rightly: he did not say that any man might 
do this; but that they who had the virtues of those that did such things, might 
also do the same.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p70><SPAN id=vi.vii-p70.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> But what more false than such a conclusion? For this is as 
much as to say, that because good men heretofore have sinned of infirmity, 
therefore he had allowance to do it of a presumptuous mind; or that if, because 
a child, by the blast of the wind, or for that it stumbled at a stone, fell down 
and defiled itself in the mire, therefore he might wilfully lie down and wallow 
like a boar therein. Who could have thought that any one could so far have been 
blinded by the power of lust? But what is written must be true: they “stumble at 
the word, being disobedient; whereunto also they were appointed.” <SCRIPREF

passage="1 Pe 2:8">1 Peter, 2:8</SCRIPREF>. His supposing that such may have the 
godly men’s virtues, who addict themselves to their vices, is also a delusion as 
strong as the other. To eat up the sin of God’s people, <SCRIPREF

one is possessed with their virtues. Nor can I believe that one who is of this 
opinion, can at present have faith or love in him. But I know you have made 
strong objections against him; prithee what can he say for himself?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p71><SPAN id=vi.vii-p71.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p72><SPAN id=vi.vii-p72.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> A very wicked answer. For though to let loose the bridle to 
lusts, while our opinions are against such things, is bad; yet, to sin, and 
plead a toleration so to do, is worse: the one stumbles beholders accidentally, 
the other leads them into the snare.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p73><SPAN id=vi.vii-p73.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p77><SPAN id=vi.vii-p77.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

themselves pilgrims, do indeed do thus. I am, as you see, an old man, and have 
been a traveller in this road many a day; and I have taken notice of many 
things.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p78>I have seen some that have set out as if they would drive all 
the world before them, who yet have, in a few days, died as they in the 
wilderness, and so never got sight of the promised land. I have seen some that 
have promised nothing at first setting out to be pilgrims, and who one would 
have thought could not have lived a day, that have yet proved very good 
pilgrims. I have seen some who have run hastily forward, that again have, after 
a little time, run just as fast back again. I have seen some who have spoken 
very well of a pilgrim’s life at first, that after a while have spoken as much 
against it. I have heard some, when they first set out for paradise, say 
positively, there is such a place, who, when they have been almost there, have 
come back again, and said there is none. I have heard some vaunt what they would 
do in case they should be opposed, that have, even at a false alarm, fled faith, 
the pilgrim’s way, and all.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p79>Now, as they were thus on their way, there came one running to 
meet them, and said, Gentlemen, and you of the weaker sort, if you love life, 
shift for yourselves, for the robbers are before you.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p80><SPAN id=vi.vii-p80.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

Little-Faith heretofore. Well, said he, we are ready for them: so they went on 
their way. Now they looked at every turning when they should have met with the 
villains; but whether they heard of Mr. Great-Heart, or whether they had some 
other game, they came not up to the pilgrims.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p81>Christiana then wished for an inn to refresh herself and her 
children, because they were weary. Then said Mr. Honest, There is one a little 
before us, where a very honorable disciple, one Gaius, dwells. <SCRIPREF

thither; and the rather, because the old gentleman gave him so good a report. 
When they came to the door they went in, not knocking, for folks use not to 
knock at the door of an inn. Then they called for the master of the house, and 
he came to them. So they asked if they might lie there that night.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p82><SPAN id=vi.vii-p82.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">GAIUS:</SPAN> Yes, gentlemen, if you be true 
men; for my house is for none but pilgrims. Then were Christiana, Mercy, and the 
boys the more glad, for that the innkeeper was a lover of pilgrims. So they 
called for rooms, and he showed them one for Christiana and her children and 
Mercy, and another for Mr. Great-Heart and the old gentleman.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p83><SPAN id=vi.vii-p83.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Then said Mr. Great-Heart, good Gaius, what hast thou for 
supper? for these pilgrims have come far to-day, and are weary.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p84><SPAN id=vi.vii-p84.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">GAIUS:</SPAN> It is late, said Gaius, so we 
cannot conveniently go out to seek food; but such as we have you shall be 
welcome to, if that will content.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p85><SPAN id=vi.vii-p85.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> We will be content with what thou hast in the house; for as

convenient.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p86>Then he went down and spake to the cook, whose name was, 
Taste-that-which-is-good, to get ready supper for so many pilgrims. This done, 
he comes up again, saying, Come, my good friends, you are welcome to me, and I 
am glad that I have a house to entertain you in; and while supper is making 
ready, if you please, let us entertain one another with some good discourse: so 
they all said, Content.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p87><SPAN id=vi.vii-p87.1

this aged matron? and whose daughter is this young damsel?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p88><SPAN id=vi.vii-p88.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> This woman is the wife of one Christian, a pilgrim of former 
times; and these are his four children. The maid is one of her acquaintance, one 
that she hath persuaded to come with her on pilgrimage. The boys take all after 
their father, and covet to tread in his steps; yea, if they do but see any place 
where the old pilgrim hath lain, or any print of his foot, it ministereth joy to 
their hearts, and they covet to lie or tread in the same.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p89><SPAN id=vi.vii-p89.1

talk of them) were very worthy men. They have, above any that I know, showed 
themselves men of great virtue and courage for the Lord of the pilgrims, his 
ways, and them that loved him. I have heard of many of your husband’s relations 
that have stood all trials for the sake of the truth. Stephen, that was one of 
the first of the family from whence your husband sprang, was knocked on the head 
with stones. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p89.3 osisRef="Bible:Acts.7.59 Bible:Acts.7.60"

of Paul and Peter, men anciently of the family from whence your husband came, 
there was Ignatius, who was cast to the lions; Romanus, whose flesh was cut by 
pieces from his bones; and Polycarp, that played the man in the fire. There was 
he that was hanged up in a basket in the sun for the wasps to eat; and he whom 
they put into a sack, and cast him into the sea to be drowned. It would be 
impossible utterly to count up all of that family who have suffered injuries and 
death for the love of a pilgrim’s life. Nor can I but be glad to see that thy 
husband has left behind him four such boys as these. I hope they will bear up 
their father’s name, and tread in their father’s steps, and come to their 
father’s end.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p90><SPAN id=vi.vii-p90.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

heartily their father’s ways.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p91><SPAN id=vi.vii-p91.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">GAIUS:</SPAN> That is it that I said. Wherefore 
Christian’s family is like still to spread abroad upon the face of the ground, 
and yet to be numerous upon the face of the earth; let Christiana look out some 
damsels for her sons, to whom they may be betrothed, etc., that the name of 
their father, and the house of his progenitors, may never be forgotten in the 
world.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p92><SPAN id=vi.vii-p92.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

it may; but let Christiana take my advice, and that is the way to uphold it. 
And, Christiana, said this innkeeper, I am glad to see thee and thy friend Mercy 
together here, a lovely couple. And if I may advise, take Mercy into a nearer 
relation to thee: if she will, let her be given to Matthew thy eldest son. It is 
the way to preserve a posterity in the earth. So this match was concluded, and 
in process of time they were married: but more of that hereafter.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p94>Gaius also proceeded, and said, I will now speak on the behalf 
of women, to take away their reproach. For as death and the curse came into the 
world by a woman, <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p94.1 osisRef="Bible:Gen.3.1"

making coats and garments to give to the poor, by which she brought a very good 
report upon the pilgrims.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p114>But to return again to our story: After supper the lads 
desired a bed, for they were weary with travelling: Then Gaius called to show 
them their chamber; but said Mercy, I will have them to bed. So she had them to 
bed, and they slept well: but the rest sat up all night; for Gaius and they were 
such suitable company, that they could not tell how to part. After much talk of 
their Lord, themselves, and their journey, old Mr. Honest, he that put forth the 
riddle to Gaius, began to nod. Then said Great-Heart, What, sir, you begin to be 
drowsy; come, rub up, now here is a riddle for you. Then said Mr. Honest, Let us 
hear it. Then replied Mr. Great-heart,</P><SPAN class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“He that would kill, must first be 
overcome:<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Who 
live abroad would, first must die at home.”<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> 
<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.vii-p115>Ha, said Mr. Honest, it is a hard one; hard to expound, and 
harder to practise. But come, landlord, said he, I will, if you please, leave my 
part to you: do you expound it, and I will hear what you say.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p116>No, said Gaius, it was put to you, and it is expected you 
should answer it. Then said the old gentleman,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“He first by 
grace must conquered be,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sin would mortify;<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Who that he lives 
would convince me,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto himself must die.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.vii-p117>It is right, said Gaius; good doctrine and experience teach 
this. For, first, until grace displays itself, and overcomes the soul with its 
glory, it is altogether without heart to oppose sin. Besides, if sin is Satan’s 
cords, by which the soul lies bound, how should it make resistance before it is 
loosed from that infirmity? Secondly, Nor will any one that knows either reason 
or grace, believe that such a man can be a living monument of grace that is a 
slave to his own corruptions. And now it comes into my mind, I will tell you a 
story worth the hearing. There were two men that went on pilgrimage; the one 
began when he was young, the other when he was old. The young man had strong 
corruptions to grapple with; the old man’s were weak with the decays of nature. 
The young man trod his steps as even as did the old one, and was every way as 
light as he. Who now, or which of them, had their graces shining clearest, since 
both seemed to be alike?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p118><SPAN id=vi.vii-p118.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> The young man’s, doubtless. For that which makes head against the 
greatest opposition, gives best demonstration that it is strongest; especially 
when it also holdeth pace with that which meets not with half so much, as to be 
sure old age does not. Besides, I have observed that old men have blessed 
themselves with this mistake; namely, taking the decays of nature for a gracious 
conquest over corruptions, and so have been apt to beguile themselves. Indeed, 
old men that are gracious are best able to give advice to them that are young, 
because they have seen most of the emptiness of things: but yet, for an old and 
a young man to set out both together, the young one has the advantage of the 
fairest discovery of a work of grace within him, though the old man’s 
corruptions are naturally the weakest. Thus they sat talking till break of 
day.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p119>Now, when the family were up, Christiana bid her son James 
that he should read a chapter; so he read 53d of Isaiah. When he had done, Mr. 
Honest asked why it was said that the Saviour was to come “out of a dry ground;” 
and also, that “he had no form nor comeliness in him.”</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p120><SPAN id=vi.vii-p120.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Then said Mr. Great-Heart, To the first I answer, because 
the church of the Jews, of which Christ came, had then lost almost all the sap 
and spirit of religion. To the second I say, the words are spoken in the person 
of unbelievers, who, because they want the eye that can see into our Prince’s 
heart, therefore they judge of him by the meanness of his outside; just like 
those who, not knowing that precious stones are covered over with a homely 
crust, when they have found one, because they know not what they have found, 
cast it away again, as men do a common stone.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p121>Well, said Gaius, now you are here, and since, as I know, Mr. 
Great-Heart is good at his weapons, if you please, after we have refreshed 
ourselves, we will walk into the fields, to see if we can do any good. About a 
mile from hence there is one Slay-good, a giant, that doth much annoy the King’s 
highway in these parts; and I know whereabout his haunt is. He is master of a 
number of thieves: ‘t would be well if we could clear these parts of him. So 
they consented and went: Mr. Great-Heart with his sword, helmet, and shield; and 
the rest with spears and staves.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p122>When they came to the place where he was, they found him with 
one Feeble-mind in his hand, whom his servants had brought unto him, having 
taken him in the way. Now the giant was rifling him, with a purpose after that 
to pick his bones; for he was of the nature of flesheaters.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p123>Well, so soon as he saw Mr. Great-Heart and his friends at the 
mouth of his cave, with their weapons, he demanded what they wanted.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p124><SPAN id=vi.vii-p124.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> We want thee; for we are come to revenge the quarrels of the 
many that thou hast slain of the pilgrims, when thou hast dragged them out of 
the King’s highway: wherefore come out of thy cave. So he armed himself and came 
out, and to battle they went, and fought for above an hour, and then stood still 
to take wind.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p125><SPAN id=vi.vii-p125.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">SLAY-GOOD:</SPAN> Then said the giant, Why are 
you here on my ground?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p126><SPAN id=vi.vii-p126.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> To revenge the blood of pilgrims, as I told thee before. So 
they went to it again, and the giant made Mr. Great-Heart give back; but he came 
up again, and in the greatness of his mind he let fly with such stoutness at the 
giant’s head and sides, that he made him let his weapon fall out of his hand. So 
he smote him, and slew him, and cut off his head, and brought it away to the 
inn. He also took Feeble-mind the pilgrim, and brought him with him to his 
lodgings. When they were come home, they showed his head to the family, and set 
it up, as they had done others before, for a terror to those that should attempt 
to do as he hereafter.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p127>Then they asked Mr. Feeble-Mind how he fell into his 
hands.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p128><SPAN id=vi.vii-p128.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
FEEBLE-MIND:</SPAN> Then said the poor man, I am a sickly man, as you see: and 
because death did usually once a day knock at my door, I thought I should never 
be well at home; so I betook myself to a pilgrim’s life, and have traveled 
hither from the town of Uncertain, where I and my father were born. I am a man 
of no strength at all of body, nor yet of mind, but would, if I could, though I 
can but crawl, spend my life in the pilgrim’s way. When I came at the gate that 
is at the head of the way, the Lord of that place did entertain me freely; 
neither objected he against my weakly looks, nor against my feeble mind; but 
gave me such things as were necessary for my journey, and bid me hope to the 
end. When I came to the house of the Interpreter, I received much kindness 
there: and because the hill of Difficulty was judged too hard for me, I was 
carried up that by one of his servants. Indeed, I have found much relief from 
pilgrims, though none were willing to go so softly as I am forced to do: yet 
still as they came on, they bid me be of good cheer, and said, that it was the 
will of their Lord that comfort should be given to the feeble-minded, <SCRIPREF 
id=vi.vii-p128.2 osisRef="Bible:1Thess.5.14" parsed="|1Thess|5|14|0|0" 
passage="1 Th 5:14">1 Thess. 5:14</SCRIPREF>; and so went on their own pace. 
When I was come to Assault-lane, then this giant met with me, and bid me prepare 
for an encounter. But, alas, feeble one that I was, I had more need of a 
cordial; so he came up and took me. I conceited he would not kill me. Also when 
he had got me into his den, since I went not with him willingly, I believed I 
should come out alive again; for I have heard, that not any pilgrim that is 
taken captive by violent hands, if he keeps heart whole towards his Master, is, 
by the laws of providence, to die by the hand of the enemy. Robbed I looked to 
be, and robbed to be sure I am; but I have, as you see, escaped with life, for 
the which I thank my King as the author, and you as the means. Other brunts I 
also look for; but this I have resolved on, to wit, to run when I can, to go 
when I cannot run, and to creep when I cannot go. As to the main, I thank him 
that loved me, I am fixed; my way is before me, my mind is beyond the river that 
has no bridge, though I am, as you see, but of a feeble mind.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p129><SPAN id=vi.vii-p129.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Then said old Mr. Honest, Have not you, sometime ago, been 
acquainted with one Mr. Fearing, a pilgrim?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p130><SPAN id=vi.vii-p130.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
FEEBLE-MIND:</SPAN> Acquainted with him! Yes, he came from the town of 
Stupidity, which lieth four degrees to the northward of the city of Destruction, 
and as many off of where I was born: yet we were well acquainted, for indeed he 
was my uncle, my father’s brother. He and I have been much of a temper: he was a 
little shorter than I, but yet we were much of a complexion.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p131><SPAN id=vi.vii-p131.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> I perceive you knew him, and I am apt to believe also that you 
were related one to another; for you have his whitely look, a cast like his with 
your eye, and your speech is much alike.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p132><SPAN id=vi.vii-p132.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
FEEBLE-MIND:</SPAN> Most have said so that have known us both: and, besides, 
what I have read in him I have for the most part found in myself.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p133><SPAN id=vi.vii-p133.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">GAIUS:</SPAN> Come, sir, said good Gaius, be of 
good cheer; you are welcome to me, and to my house. What thou hast a mind to, 
call for freely; and what thou wouldst have my servants do for thee, they will 
do it with a ready mind.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p134>Then said Mr. Feeble-mind, This is an unexpected favor, and as 
the sun shining out of a very dark cloud. Did giant Slay-good intend me this 
favor when he stopped me, and resolved to let me go no further? Did he intend, 
that after he had rifled my pockets I should go to Gaius mine host? Yet so it 
is.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p135>Now, just as Mr. Feeble-mind and Gaius were thus in talk, 
there came one running, and called at the door, and said, that about a mile and 
a half off there was one Mr. Not-right, a pilgrim, struck dead upon the place 
where he was, with a thunderbolt.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p136><SPAN id=vi.vii-p136.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
FEEBLE-MIND:</SPAN> Alas! said Mr. Feeble-mind, is he slain? He overtook me some 
days before I came so far as hither, and would be my company-keeper. He was also 
with me when Slay-good the giant took me, but he was nimble of his heels, and 
escaped; but it seems he escaped to die, and I was taken to live.</P><SPAN

<P id=vi.vii-p137>Now, about this time Matthew and Mercy were married; also 
Gaius gave his daughter Phebe to James, Matthew’s brother, to wife; after which 
time they yet stayed about ten days at Gaius’ house, spending their time and the 
seasons like as pilgrims use to do.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p138>When they were to depart, Gaius made them a feast, and they 
did eat and drink, and were merry. Now the hour was come that they must be gone; 
wherefore Mr. Great-heart called for a reckoning. But Gaius told him, that at 
his house it was not the custom for pilgrims to pay for their entertainment. He 
boarded them by the year, but looked for his pay from the good Samaritan, who 
had promised him, at his return, whatsoever charge he was at with them, 
faithfully to repay him. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p138.1

all, and his children, and particularly of Mr. Feeble-mind. He also gave him 
something to drink by the way.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p140>Now Mr. Feeble-mind, when they were going out of the door, 
made as if he intended to linger. The which, when Mr. Great-Heart espied, he 
said, Come, Mr. Feeble-mind, pray do you go along with us: I will be your

strong, but I, as you see, am weak; I choose, therefore, rather to come behind, 
lest, by reason of my many infirmities, I should be both a burden to myself and 
to you. I am, as I said, a man of a weak and feeble mind, and shall be offended 
and made weak at that which others can bear. I shall like no laughing; I shall 
like no gay attire; I shall like no unprofitable questions. Nay, I am so weak a 
man as to be offended with that which others have a liberty to do. I do not yet 
know all the truth: I am a very ignorant Christian man. Sometimes, if I hear 
some rejoice in the Lord, it troubles me because I cannot do so too. It is with 
me as it is with a weak man among the strong, or as with a sick man among the

<P id=vi.vii-p148>Thus, therefore, they went on. Mr. Great-Heart and Mr. Honest 
went before, Christiana and her children went next, and Mr. Feeble-mind came 
behind, and Mr. Ready-to-halt with his crutches. Then said Mr. Honest,</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p149><SPAN id=vi.vii-p149.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p150><SPAN id=vi.vii-p150.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> With a good will. I suppose you have heard how Christian of 
old did meet with Apollyon in the Valley of Humiliation, and also what hard work 
he had to go through the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Also I think you cannot 
but have heard how Faithful was put to it by Madam Wanton, with Adam the First, 
with one Discontent, and Shame; four as deceitful villains as a man can meet 
with upon the road.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p151><SPAN id=vi.vii-p151.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p152><SPAN id=vi.vii-p152.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p153><SPAN id=vi.vii-p153.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p154><SPAN id=vi.vii-p154.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p155><SPAN id=vi.vii-p155.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p156><SPAN id=vi.vii-p156.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

out.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p157>Thus they went on till they came to the place where Evangelist 
met with Christian and Faithful, and prophesied to them what should befall them 
at Vanity Fair. Then said their guide, Hereabouts did Christian and Faithful

with at Vanity Fair.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p158><SPAN id=vi.vii-p158.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p162><SPAN id=vi.vii-p162.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p163><SPAN id=vi.vii-p163.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR.

<P id=vi.vii-p165><SPAN id=vi.vii-p165.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> A very arch fellow, a downright hypocrite; one that would be 
religious, whichever way the world went; but so cunning, that he would be sure 
never to lose or suffer for it. He had his mode of religion for every fresh 
occasion, and his wife was as good at it as he. He would turn from opinion to 
opinion; yea, and plead for so doing, too. But, so far as I could learn, he came 
to an ill end with his by-ends; nor did I ever hear that any of his children 
were ever of any esteem with any that truly feared God.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p166>Now by this time they were come within sight of the town of 
Vanity, where Vanity Fair is kept. So, when they saw that they were so near the 
town, they consulted with one another how they should pass through the town; and 
some said one thing, and some another. At last Mr. Great-Heart said, I have, as 
you may understand, often been a conductor of pilgrims through this town. Now, I 
am acquainted with one Mr. Mnason, <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p166.1 
osisRef="Bible:Acts.21.16" parsed="|Acts|21|16|0|0" passage="Ac 21:16">Acts

lodge. If you think good, we will turn in there.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p167>Content, said old Honest; Content, said Christiana; Content, 
said Mr. Feeble-mind; and so they said all. Now you must think it was eventide 
by that they got to the outside of the town; but Mr. Great-Heart knew the way to 
the old man’s house. So thither they came; and he called at the door, and the 
old man within knew his tongue as soon as ever he heard it; so he opened the 
door, and they all came in. Then said Mnason, their host, How far have ye come 
to-day? So they said, from the house of Gaius our friend. I promise you, said 
he, you have gone a good stitch. You may well be weary; sit down. So they sat 
down.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p168><SPAN id=vi.vii-p168.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Then said their guide, Come, what cheer, good sirs? I dare 
say you are welcome to my friend.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p169><SPAN id=vi.vii-p169.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
MNASON:</SPAN> I also, said Mr. Mnason, do bid you welcome; and whatever you 
want, do but say, and we will do what we can to get it for you.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p170><SPAN id=vi.vii-p170.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Our great want, a while since, was harbor and good company, and 
now I hope we have both.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p171><SPAN id=vi.vii-p171.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
MNASON:</SPAN> For harbor, you see what it is; but for good company, that will 
appear in the trial.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p172><SPAN id=vi.vii-p172.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> Well, said Mr. Great-Heart, will you have the pilgrims up 
into their lodging?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p173><SPAN id=vi.vii-p173.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
MNASON:</SPAN> I will, said Mr. Mnason So he had them to their respective 
places; and also showed them a very fair dining-room, where they might be, and 
sup together until the time should come to go to rest.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p174>Now, when they were seated in their places, and were a little 
cheery after their journey, Mr. Honest asked his landlord if there was any store 
of good people in the town.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p175><SPAN id=vi.vii-p175.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
MNASON:</SPAN> We have a few: for indeed they are but a few when compared with 
them on the other side.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p176><SPAN id=vi.vii-p176.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> But how shall we do to see some of them? for the sight of good 
men to them that are going on pilgrimage, is like the appearing of the moon and 
stars to them that are sailing upon the seas.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p177><SPAN id=vi.vii-p177.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
MNASON:</SPAN> Then Mr. Mnason stamped with his foot, and his daughter Grace 
came up. So he said unto her, Grace, go you, tell my friends, Mr. Contrite, Mr. 
Holy-man, Mr. Love-saints, Mr. Dare-not-lie, and Mr. Penitent, that I have a 
friend or two at my house who have a mind this evening to see them. So Grace 
went to call them, and they came; and after salutation made, they sat down 
together at the table.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p178>Then said Mr. Mnason their landlord, My neighbors, I have, as 
you see, a company of strangers come to my house; they are pilgrims: they come 
from afar, and are going to Mount Zion. But who, quoth he, do you think this is? 
pointing his finger to Christiana. It is Christiana, the wife of Christian, the 
famous pilgrim, who, with Faithful his brother, was so shamefully handled in our 
town. At that they stood amazed, saying, We little thought to see Christiana 
when Grace came to call us; wherefore this is a very comfortable surprise. They 
then asked her of her welfare, and if these young men were her husband’s sons. 
And when she had told them they were, they said, The King whom you love and 
serve make you as your father, and bring you where he is in peace.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p179><SPAN id=vi.vii-p179.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Then Mr. Honest (when they were all sat down) asked Mr. Contrite 
and the rest, in what posture their town was at present.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p180><SPAN id=vi.vii-p180.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
CONTRITE:</SPAN> You may be sure we are full of hurry in fair-time. ‘T is hard 
keeping our hearts and spirits in good order when we are in a cumbered 
condition. He that lives in such a place as this is, and has to do with such as 
we have, has need of an item to caution him to take heed every moment of the 
day.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p181><SPAN id=vi.vii-p181.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> But how are your neighbors now for quietness?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p182><SPAN id=vi.vii-p182.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
CONTRITE:</SPAN> They are much more moderate now than formerly. You know how 
Christian and Faithful were used at our town; but of late, I say, they have been 
far more moderate. I think the blood of Faithful lieth as a load upon them till 
now; for since they burned him, they have been ashamed to burn any more. In 
those days we were afraid to walk the street; but now we can show our heads. 
Then the name of a professor was odious; now, especially in some parts of our 
town, (for you know our town is large,) religion is counted honorable. Then said 
Mr. Contrite to them, Pray how fareth it with you in your pilgrimage? how stands 
the country affected towards you?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p183><SPAN id=vi.vii-p183.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> It happens to us as it happeneth to wayfaring men: sometimes our 
way is clean, sometimes foul; sometimes up hill, sometimes down hill; we are 
seldom at a certainty. The wind is not always on our backs, nor is every one a 
friend that we meet with in the way. We have met with some notable rubs already, 
and what are yet behind we know not; but for the most part, we find it true that 
has been talked of old, A good man must suffer trouble.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p184><SPAN id=vi.vii-p184.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
CONTRITE:</SPAN> You talk of rubs; what rubs have you met withal?</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p185><SPAN id=vi.vii-p185.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HONEST:</SPAN> Nay, ask Mr. Great-Heart, our guide; for he can give the best 
account of that.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p186><SPAN id=vi.vii-p186.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
GREAT-HEART:</SPAN> We have been beset three or four times already. First, 
Christiana and her children were beset by two ruffians, who they feared would 
take away their lives. We were beset by Giant Bloody-man, Giant Maul, and Giant 
Slay-good. Indeed, we did rather beset the last than were beset by him. And thus 
it was: after we had been some time at the house of Gaius mine host, and of the 
whole church, we were minded upon a time to take our weapons with us, and go see 
if we could light upon any of those that are enemies to pilgrims; for we heard 
that there was a notable one thereabouts. Now Gaius knew his haunt better than 
I, because he dwelt thereabout. So we looked, and looked, till at last we 
discerned the mouth of his cave: then we were glad, and plucked up our spirits. 
So we approached up to his den; and lo, when we came there, he had dragged, by 
mere force, into his net, this poor man, Mr. Feeble-mind, and was about to bring 
him to his end. But when he saw us, supposing, as we thought, he had another 
prey, he left the poor man in his hole, and came out. So we fell to it full 
sore, and he lustily laid about him; but, in conclusion, he was brought down to 
the ground, and his head cut off, and set up by the way-side for a terror to 
such as should after practise such ungodliness. That I tell you the truth, here 
is the man himself to affirm it, who was as a lamb taken out of the mouth of the 
lion.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p187><SPAN id=vi.vii-p187.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
FEEBLE-MIND:</SPAN> Then said Mr. Feeble-mind, I found this true, to my cost and 
comfort: to my cost, when he threatened to pick my bones every moment; and to my 
comfort, when I saw Mr. Great-Heart and his friends, with their weapons, 
approach so near for my deliverance.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p188><SPAN id=vi.vii-p188.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
HOLY-MAN:</SPAN> Then said Mr. Holy-man, There are two things that they have 
need to possess who go on pilgrimage; courage, and an unspotted life. If they 
have not courage, they can never hold on their way; and if their lives be loose, 
they will make the very name of a pilgrim stink.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p189><SPAN id=vi.vii-p189.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
LOVE-SAINTS:</SPAN> Then said Mr. Love-saints, I hope this caution is not 
needful among you: but truly there are many that go upon the road, who rather 
declare themselves strangers to pilgrimage, than strangers and pilgrims on the 
earth.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p190><SPAN id=vi.vii-p190.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
DARE-NOT-LIE:</SPAN> Then said Mr. Dare-not-lie, ‘Tis true. They have neither 
the pilgrim’s weed, nor the pilgrim’s courage; they go not uprightly, but all 
awry with their feet; one shoe goeth inward, another outward; and their hosen 
are out behind: here a rag, and there a rent, to the disparagement of their 
Lord.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p191><SPAN id=vi.vii-p191.1 style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">MR. 
PENITENT:</SPAN> These things, said Mr. Penitent, they ought to be troubled for; 
nor are the pilgrims like to have that grace put upon them and their Pilgrim’s 
Progress as they desire, until the way is cleared of such spots and blemishes. 
Thus they sat talking and spending the time until supper was set upon the table, 
unto which they went, and refreshed their weary bodies: so they went to 
rest.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p192>Now they staid in the fair a great while, at the house of Mr. 
Mnason, who in process of time gave his daughter Grace unto Samuel, Christian’s 
son, to wife, and his daughter Martha to Joseph.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p193>The time, as I said, that they staid here, was long, for it 
was not now as in former times. Wherefore the pilgrims grew acquainted with many 
of the good people of the town, and did them what service they could. Mercy, as 
she was wont, labored much for the poor: wherefore their bellies and backs 
blessed her, and she was there an ornament to her profession. And, to say the 
truth for Grace, Phebe, and Martha, they were all of a very good nature, and did 
much good in their places. They were also all of them very fruitful; so that 
Christian’s name, as was said before, was like to live in the world.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p194>While they lay here, there came a monster out of the woods, 
and slew many of the people of the town. It would also carry away their 
children, and teach them to suck its whelps. Now, no man in the town durst so 
much as face this monster; but all fled when they heard the noise of his 
coming.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p195>The monster was like unto no one beast on the earth. Its body 
was like a dragon, and it had seven heads and ten horns. It made great havoc of 
children, and yet it was governed by a woman. <SCRIPREF id=vi.vii-p195.1 
osisRef="Bible:Rev.17.3" parsed="|Rev|17|3|0|0" passage="Rev 17:3">Rev. 
17:3</SCRIPREF>. This monster propounded conditions to men; and such men as 
loved their lives more than their souls, accepted of those conditions. So they 
came under.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p196>Now Mr. Great-Heart, together with those who came to visit the 
pilgrims at Mr. Mnason’s house, entered into a covenant to go and engage this 
beast, if perhaps they might deliver the people of this town from the paws and 
mouth of this so devouring a serpent.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p197>Then did Mr. Great-Heart, Mr. Contrite, Mr. Holy-man, Mr. 
Dare-not-lie, and Mr. Penitent, with their weapons, go forth to meet him. Now 
the monster at first was very rampant, and looked upon these enemies with great 
disdain; but they so belabored him, being sturdy men at arms, that they made him 
make a retreat: so they came home to Mr. Mnason’s house again.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p198>The monster, you must know, had his certain seasons to come 
out in, and to make his attempts upon the children of the people of the town. At 
these seasons did these valiant worthies watch him, and did still continually 
assault him; insomuch that in process of time he became not only wounded, but 
lame. Also he has not made that havoc of the townsmen’s children as formerly he 
had done; and it is verily believed by some that this beast will die of his 
wounds.</P>
<P id=vi.vii-p199>This, therefore, made Mr. Great-Heart and his fellows of great 
fame in this town; so that many of the people that wanted their taste of things, 
yet had a reverent esteem and respect for them. Upon this account, therefore, it 
was, that these pilgrims got not much hurt here. True, there were some of the 
baser sort, that could see no more than a mole, nor understand any more than a 
beast; these had no reverence for these men, and took no notice of their valor 
and adventures.</P>
<P class=div2>THE SEVENTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=vi.viii-p0.1><A id=vi.viii-p0.2></A>THE SEVENTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=vi.viii-p1>Well, the time grew on that the pilgrims must go on their way; 
wherefore they prepared for their journey. They sent for their friends; they 
conferred with them; they had some time set apart therein to commit each other 
to the protection of their Prince. There were again that brought them of such 
things as they had, that were fit for the weak and the strong, for the women and 
the men, and so laded them with such things as were necessary. <SCRIPREF 
id=vi.viii-p1.1 osisRef="Bible:Acts.28.10" parsed="|Acts|28|10|0|0" 
passage="Ac 28:10">Acts 28:10</SCRIPREF>. Then they set forward on their way; 
and their friends accompanying them so far as was convenient, they again 
committed each other to the protection of their King, and parted.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p2>They therefore that were of the pilgrims’ company went on, and 
Mr. Great-Heart went before them. Now, the women and children being weakly, they 
were forced to go as they could bear; by which means Mr. Ready-to-halt and Mr. 
Feeble-mind, had more to sympathize with their condition.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p3>When they were gone from the townsmen, and when their friends 
had bid them farewell, they quickly came to the place where Faithful was put to 
death. Therefore they made a stand, and thanked him that had enabled him to bear 
his cross so well; and the rather, because they now found that they had a 
benefit by such a manly suffering as his was.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p4>They went on therefore after this a good way further, talking 
of Christian and Faithful, and how Hopeful joined himself to Christian after 
that Faithful was dead.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p5>Now they were come up with the hill Lucre, where the silver 
mine was which took Demas off from his pilgrimage, and into which, as some 
think, By-ends fell and perished; wherefore they considered that. But when they 
were come to the old monument that stood over against the hill Lucre, to wit, to 
the pillar of salt, that stood also within view of Sodom and its stinking lake, 
they marvelled, as did Christian before, that men of such knowledge and ripeness 
of wit as they were, should be so blinded as to turn aside here. Only they 
considered again, that nature is not affected with the harms that others have 
met with, especially if that thing upon which they look has an attracting virtue 
upon the foolish eye.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p6>I saw now, that they went on till they came to the river that 
was on this side of the Delectable Mountains; to the river where the fine trees 
grow on both sides, and whose leaves, if taken inwardly, are good against 
surfeits; where the meadows are green all the year long, and where they might 
lie down safely. <SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p6.1 osisRef="Bible:Ps.23.2" 
parsed="|Ps|23|2|0|0" passage="Ps 23:2">Psa. 23:2</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p7>By this river-side, in the meadows, there were cotes and folds 
for sheep, a house built for the nourishing and bringing up of those lambs, the 
babes of those women that go on pilgrimage. Also there was here one that was 
intrusted with them, who could have compassion; and that could gather these 
lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that were 
with young. <SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p7.1 osisRef="Bible:Heb.5.2"

id=vi.viii-p7.2 osisRef="Bible:Isa.40.11" parsed="|Isa|40|11|0|0" 
passage="Isa 40:11">Isa. 40:11</SCRIPREF>. Now, to the care of this man 
Christiana admonished her four daughters to commit their little ones, that by 
these waters they might be housed, harbored, succored, and nourished, and that 
none of them might be lacking in time to come. This man, if any of them go 
astray, or be lost, will bring them again; he will also bind up that which was 
broken, and will strengthen them that are sick. <SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p7.3 
osisRef="Bible:Jer.23.4" parsed="|Jer|23|4|0|0" passage="Jer 23:4">Jer. 
23:4</SCRIPREF>; <SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p7.4 osisRef="Bible:Ezek.34.11-Ezek.34.16" 
parsed="|Ezek|34|11|34|16" passage="Eze 34:11-16">Ezek. 34:11-16</SCRIPREF>. 
Here they will never want meat, drink, and clothing; here they will be kept from 
thieves and robbers; for this man will die before one of those committed to his 
trust shall be lost. Besides, here they shall be sure to have good nurture and 
admonition, and shall be taught to walk in right paths, and that you know is a 
favor of no small account. Also here, as you see, are delicate waters, pleasant 
meadows, dainty flowers, variety of trees, and such as bear wholesome fruit: 
fruit, not like that which Matthew ate of, that fell over the wall out of 
Beelzebub’s garden; but fruit that procureth health where there is none, and 
that continueth and increaseth it where it is. So they were content to commit 
their little ones to him; and that which was also an encouragement to them so to 
do, was, for that all this was to be at the charge of the King, and so was as an 
hospital to young children and orphans.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p8>Now they went on. And when they were come to By-path Meadow, to 
the stile over which Christian went with his fellow Hopeful, when they were 
taken by Giant Despair and put into Doubting Castle, they sat down, and 
consulted what was best to be done: to wit, now they were so strong, and had got 
such a man as Mr. Great-Heart for their conductor, whether they had not best to 
make an attempt upon the giant, demolish his castle, and if there were any 
pilgrims in it, to set them at liberty before they went any further. So one said 
one thing, and another said the contrary. One questioned if it was lawful to go 
upon unconsecrated ground; another said they might, provided their end was good; 
but Mr. Great-Heart said, Though that assertion offered last cannot be 
universally true, yet I have a commandment to resist sin, to overcome evil, to 
fight the good fight of faith: and I pray, with whom should I fight this good 
fight, if not with Giant Despair? I will therefore attempt the taking away of 
his life, and the demolishing of Doubting Castle. Then said he, Who will go with 
me? Then said old Honest, I will. And so will we too, said Christiana’s four 
sons, Matthew, Samuel, Joseph, and James; for they were young men and strong. 
<SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p8.1 osisRef="Bible:1John.2.13 Bible:1John.2.14" 
parsed="|1John|2|13|0|0;|1John|2|14|0|0" passage="1 Jn 2:13,14">1 John 
2:13,14</SCRIPREF>. So they left the women in the road, and with them Mr. 
Feeble-mind, and Mr. Ready-to-halt with his crutches, to be their guard until 
they came back; for in that place the Giant Despair dwelt so near, they keeping 
in the road, a little child might lead them. <SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p8.2 
osisRef="Bible:Isa.11.6" parsed="|Isa|11|6|0|0" passage="Isa 11:6">Isa. 
11:6</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p9>So Mr. Great-Heart, old Honest, and the four young men, went to 
go up to Doubting Castle, to look for Giant Despair. When they came at the 
castle gate, they knocked for entrance with an unusual noise. At that the old 
Giant comes to the gate, and Diffidence his wife follows. Then said he, Who and 
what is he that is so hardy, as after this manner to molest the Giant Despair? 
Mr. Great-Heart replied, It is I, Great-Heart, one of the King of the Celestial 
country’s conductors of pilgrims to their place; and I demand of thee that thou 
open thy gates for my entrance: prepare thyself also to fight, for I am come to 
take away thy head; and to demolish Doubting Castle.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p10>Now Giant Despair, because he was a giant, thought no man 
could overcome him: and again thought he, Since heretofore I have made a 
conquest of angels, shall Great-Heart make me afraid? So he harnessed himself, 
and went out. He had a cap of steel upon his head, a breast-plate of fire girded 
to him, and he came out in iron shoes, with a great club in his hand. Then these 
six men made up to him, and beset him behind and before: also, when Diffidence 
the giantess came up to help him, old Mr. Honest cut her down at one blow. Then 
they fought for their lives, and Giant Despair was brought down to the ground, 
but was very loth die. He struggled hard, and had, as they say, as many lives as 
a cat; but Great-Heart was his death, for he left him not till he had severed 
his head from his shoulders.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p11>Then they fell to demolishing Doubting Castle, and that you 
know might with ease be done, since Giant Despair was dead. They were seven days 
in destroying of that; and in it of pilgrims they found one Mr. Despondency, 
almost starved to death, and one Much-afraid, his daughter: these two they saved 
alive. But it would have made you wonder to have seen the dead bodies that lay 
here and there in the castle yard, and how full of dead men’s bones the dungeon 
was.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p12>When Mr. Great-Heart and his companions had performed this 
exploit, they took Mr. Despondency, and his daughter Much-afraid, into their 
protection; for they were honest people, though they were prisoners in Doubting 
Castle to that tyrant Giant Despair. They, therefore, I say, took with them the 
head of the giant, (for his body they had buried under a heap of stones,) and 
down to the road and to their companions they came, and showed them what they 
had done. Now, when Feeble-mind and Ready-to-halt saw that it was the head of 
Giant Despair indeed, they were very jocund and merry. Now Christiana, if need 
was, could play upon the viol, and her daughter Mercy upon the lute: so, since 
they were so merry disposed, she played them a lesson, and Ready-to-halt would 
dance. So he took Despondency’s daughter, Much-afraid, by the hand, and to 
dancing they went in the road. True, he could not dance without one crutch in 
his hand, but I promise you he footed it well: also the girl was to be 
commended, for she answered the music handsomely.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p13>As for Mr. Despondency, the music was not so much to him; he 
was for feeding rather than dancing, for that he was almost starved. So 
Christiana gave him some of her bottle of spirits for present relief, and then 
prepared him something to eat; and in a little time the old gentleman came to 
himself, and began to be finely revived.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p14>Now I saw in my dream, when all these things were finished, 
Mr. Great-Heart took the head of Giant Despair, and set it upon a pole by the 
highway-side, right over against the pillar that Christian erected for a caution 
to pilgrims that came after, to take heed of entering into his grounds.</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Then he writ 
under it upon a marble stone these verses following:<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“This is the head of 
him whose name only<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>In former times did pilgrims terrify.<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>His castle’s down, 
and Diffidence his wife<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Brave Mr. Great-Heart has bereft of life.<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Despondency, his 
daughter Much-afraid,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Great-Heart for them also the man has play’d.<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Who hereof doubts, 
if he’ll but cast his eye<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Up hither, may his scruples satisfy.<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>This head also, when 
doubting cripples dance,<SPAN class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>Doth show from fears they have deliverance.”<SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.viii-p15>When these men had thus bravely showed themselves against 
Doubting Castle, and had slain Giant Despair, they went forward, and went on 
till they came to the Delectable Mountains, where Christian and Hopeful 
refreshed themselves with the varieties of the place. They also acquainted 
themselves with the shepherds there, who welcomed them, as they had done 
Christian before, unto the Delectable Mountains.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p16>Now the shepherds seeing so great a train follow Mr. 
Great-Heart, (for with him they were well acquainted,) they said unto him, Good 
sir, you have got a goodly company here; pray where did you find all these?</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p17>Then Mr. Great-Heart replied,</P><SPAN 
class=XML>&lt;verse&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;l&gt;</SPAN>“First, here is

class=XML>&lt;/l&gt;</SPAN> <SPAN class=XML>&lt;/verse&gt;</SPAN> 
<P id=vi.viii-p18>Then said the shepherds, This is a comfortable company. You 
are welcome to us; for we have for the feeble, as well as for the strong. Our 
Prince has an eye to what is done to the least of these; therefore Infirmity 
must not be a block to our entertainment. <SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p18.1 
osisRef="Bible:Matt.25.40" parsed="|Matt|25|40|0|0" passage="Mt 25:40">Matt. 
25:40</SCRIPREF>. So they had them to the palace door, and then said unto them, 
Come in, Mr. Feeble-Mind; come in Mr. Ready-to-halt; Come in, Mr. Despondency, 
and Mrs. Much-afraid his daughter. These, Mr. Great-Heart, said the shepherds to 
the guide, we call in by name, for that they are most subject to draw back; but 
as for you, and the rest that are strong, we leave you to your wonted liberty. 
Then said Mr. Great-Heart, This day I see that grace doth shine in your faces, 
and that you are my Lord’s shepherds indeed; for that you have not pushed these 
diseased neither with side nor shoulder, but have rather strewed their way into 
the palace with flowers, as you should. <SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p18.2 
osisRef="Bible:Ezek.34.21" parsed="|Ezek|34|21|0|0" passage="Eze 34:21">Ezek. 
34:21</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p19>So the feeble and weak went in, and Mr. Great-Heart and the 
rest did follow. When they were also set down, the shepherds said to those of 
the weaker sort, What is it that you would have? for, said they, all things must 
be managed here to the supporting of the weak, as well as to the warning of the 
unruly. So they made them a feast of things easy of digestion, and that were 
pleasant to the palate and nourishing; the which when they had received, they 
went to their rest, each one respectively unto his proper place.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p20>When morning was come, because the mountains were high and the 
day clear, and because it was the custom of the shepherds to show the pilgrims 
before their departure some rarities, therefore, after they were ready, and had 
refreshed themselves, the shepherds took them out into the fields, and showed 
them first what they had shown to Christian before.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p21>Then they had them to some new places. The first was Mount 
Marvel, where they looked, and beheld a man at a distance that tumbled the hills 
about with words. Then they asked the shepherds what that should mean. So they 
told them, that that man was the son of one Mr. Great-grace, of whom you read in 
the first part of the records of the Pilgrim’s Progress; and he is set there to 
teach pilgrims how to believe down, or to tumble out of their ways, what 
difficulties they should meet with, by faith. <SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p21.1 
osisRef="Bible:Mark.11.23 Bible:Mark.11.24" 
parsed="|Mark|11|23|0|0;|Mark|11|24|0|0" passage="Mk 11:23,24">Mark 
11:23,24</SCRIPREF>. Then said Mr. Great-Heart, I know him; he is a man above 
many.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p22>Then they had them to another place, called Mount Innocence. 
And there they saw a man clothed all in white; and two men, Prejudice and 
Ill-will, continually casting dirt upon him. Now behold, the dirt, whatsoever 
they cast at him, would in a little time fall off again, and his garment would 
look as clear as if no dirt had been cast thereat. Then said the pilgrims, What 
means this? The shepherds answered, This man is named Godlyman, and this garment 
is to show the innocency of his life. Now, those that throw dirt at him are such 
as hate his well-doing; but, as you see the dirt will not stick upon his 
clothes, so it shall be with him that liveth innocently in the world. Whoever 
they be that would make such men dirty, they labor all in vain; for God, by that 
a little time is spent, will cause that their innocence shall break forth as the 
light, and their righteousness as the noonday.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p23>Then they took them, and had them to Mount Charity, where they 
showed them a man that had a bundle of cloth lying before him, out of which he 
cut coats and garments for the poor that stood about him; yet his bundle or roll 
of cloth was never the less. Then said they, What should this be? This is, said 
the shepherds, to show you, that he who has a heart to give of his labor to the 
poor, shall never want wherewithal. He that watereth shall be watered himself. 
And the cake that the widow gave to the prophet did not cause that she had the 
less in her barrel.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p24>They had them also to the place where they saw one Fool and 
one Want-wit washing an Ethiopian, with intention to make him white; but the 
more they washed him, the blacker he was. Then they asked the shepherds what 
that should mean. So they told them, saying, Thus it is with the vile person; 
all means used to get such a one a good name, shall in conclusion tend but to 
make him more abominable. Thus it was with the pharisees; and so it shall be 
with all hypocrites.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p25>Then said Mercy, the wife of Matthew, to Christiana her 
mother, Mother, I would, if it might be, see the hole in the hill, or that 
commonly called the By-way to hell. So her mother brake her mind to the 
shepherds. Then they went to the door; it was on the side of an hill; and they 
opened it, and bid Mercy hearken a while. So she hearkened, and heard one 
saying, Cursed be my father for holding of my feet back from the way of peace 
and life. Another said, Oh that I had been torn in pieces before I had, to save 
my life, lost my soul! And another said, If I were to live again, how would I 
deny myself, rather than to come to this place! Then there was as if the very 
earth groaned and quaked under the feet of this young woman for fear; so she 
looked white, and came trembling away, saying, Blessed be he and she that is 
delivered from this place!</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p26>Now, when the shepherds had shown them all these things, then 
they had them back to the palace, and entertained them with what the house would 
afford. But Mercy, being a young and married woman, longed for something that 
she saw there, but was ashamed to ask. Her mother-in-law then asked her what she 
ailed, for she looked as one not well. Then said Mercy, There is a looking-glass 
hangs up in the dining-room, off which I cannot take my mind; if, therefore, I 
have it not, I think I shall miscarry. Then said her mother, I will mention thy 
wants to the shepherds, and they will not deny thee. But she said, I am ashamed 
that these men should know that I longed. Nay, my daughter, said she, it is no 
shame, but a virtue, to long for such a thing as that. So Mercy said, Then 
mother, if you please, ask the shepherds if they are willing to sell it.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p27>Now the glass was one of a thousand. It would present a man, 
one way, with his own features exactly; and turn it but another way, and it 
would show one the very face and similitude of the Prince of pilgrims himself. 
Yes, I have talked with them that can tell, and they have said that they have 
seen the very crown of thorns upon his head by looking in that glass; they have 
therein also seen the holes in his hands, his feet, and his side. Yea, such an 
excellency is there in this glass, that it will show him to one where they have 
a mind to see him, whether living or dead; whether in earth, or in heaven; 
whether in a state of humiliation, or in his exaltation; whether coming to 
suffer, or coming to reign. <SCRIPREF id=vi.viii-p27.1 osisRef="Bible:Jas.1.23"

<P id=vi.viii-p28>Christiana therefore went to the shepherds apart, (now the 
names of the shepherds were Knowledge, Experience, Watchful, and Sincere,) and 
said unto them, There is one of my daughters, a breeding woman, that I think 
doth long for something that she hath seen in this house; and she thinks that 
she shall miscarry if she should by you be denied.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p29><SPAN id=vi.viii-p29.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">EXPERIENCE:</SPAN> Call her, call her, she 
shall assuredly have what we can help her to. So they called her, and said to 
her, Mercy, what is that thing thou wouldst have? Then she blushed, and said, 
The great glass that hangs up in the dining-room. So Sincere ran and fetched it, 
and with a joyful consent it was given her. Then she bowed her head, and gave 
thanks, and said, By this I know that I have obtained favor in your eyes.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p30>They also gave to the other young women such things as they 
desired, and to their husbands great commendations, for that they had joined 
with Mr. Great-Heart in the slaying of Giant Despair, and the demolishing of 
Doubting Castle.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p31>About Christiana’s neck the shepherds put a bracelet, and so 
did they about the necks of her four daughters; also they put ear-rings in their 
ears, and jewels on their foreheads.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p32>When they were minded to go hence, they let them go in peace, 
but gave not to them those certain cautions which before were given to Christian 
and his companion. The reason was, for that these had Great-Heart to be their 
guide, who was one that was well acquainted with things, and so could give them 
their cautions more seasonably, to wit, even when the danger was nigh the 
approaching. What cautions Christian and his companion had received of the 
shepherds, they had also lost by that the time was come that they had need to 
put them in practice. Wherefore, here was the advantage that this company had 
over the other.</P>
<P id=vi.viii-p33>From thence they went on singing, and they said,</P><SPAN

<P class=div2>THE EIGHTH STAGE</P>
<H2 id=vi.ix-p0.1><A id=vi.ix-p0.2></A>THE EIGHTH STAGE</H2>
<P id=vi.ix-p1>When they were gone from the shepherds, they quickly came to the 
place where Christian met with one Turn-away that dwelt in the town of Apostasy. 
Wherefore of him Mr. Great-Heart their guide now put them in mind, saying, This 
is the place where Christian met with one Turn-away, who carried with him the 
character of his rebellion at his back. And this I have to say concerning this 
man; he would hearken to no counsel, but once a falling, persuasion could not 
stop him. When he came to the place where the cross and sepulchre were, he did 
meet with one that did bid him look there; but he gnashed with his teeth, and 
stamped, and said he was resolved to go back to his own town. Before he came to 
the gate, he met with Evangelist, who offered to lay hands on him, to turn him 
into the way again; but this Turn-away resisted him, and having done much 
despite unto him, he got away over the wall, and so escaped his hand.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p2>Then they went on; and just at the place where Little-Faith 
formerly was robbed, there stood a man with his sword drawn, and his face all 
over with blood. Then said Mr. Great-Heart, Who art thou? The man made answer, 
saying, I am one whose name is Valiant-for-truth. I am a pilgrim, and am going 
to the Celestial City. Now, as I was in my way, there were three men that did 
beset me, and propounded unto me these three things: 1. Whether I would become 
one of them. 2. Or go back from whence I came. 3. Or die upon the place. 
<SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p2.1 osisRef="Bible:Prov.1.11-Prov.1.14" 
parsed="|Prov|1|11|1|14" passage="Pr 1:11-14">Prov. 1:11-14</SCRIPREF>. To the 
first I answered, I had been a true man for a long season, and therefore it 
could not be expected that I should now cast in my lot with thieves. Then they 
demanded what I would say to the second. So I told them that the place from 
whence I came, had I not found incommodity there, I had not forsaken it at all; 
but finding it altogether unsuitable to me, and very unprofitable for me, I 
forsook it for this way. Then they asked me what I said to the third. And I told 
them my life cost far more dear than that I should lightly give it away. 
Besides, you have nothing to do thus to put things to my choice; wherefore at 
your peril be it if you meddle. Then these three, to wit, Wild-head, 
Inconsiderate, and Pragmatic, drew upon me, and I also drew upon them. So we 
fell to it, one against three, for the space of above three hours. They have 
left upon me, as you see, some of the marks of their valor, and have also 
carried away with them some of mine. They are but just now gone; I suppose they 
might, as the saying is, hear your horse dash, and so they betook themselves to 
flight.</P>

<P id=vi.ix-p13>Now, as they went on, because Mr. Great-Heart was delighted in 
him, (for he loved one greatly that he found to be a man of his hands,) and 
because there were in company those that were feeble and weak, therefore he 
questioned with him about many things; as first, what countryman he was.</P>

that which caused me to come on pilgrimage was this. We had one Mr. Tell-true 
come into our parts, and he told it about what Christian had done, that went 
from the City of Destruction; namely, how he had forsaken his wife and children, 
and had betaken himself to a pilgrim’s life. It was also confidently reported, 
how he had killed a serpent that did come out to resist him in his journey; and 
how he got through to whither he intended. It was also told what welcome he had 
at all his Lord’s lodgings, especially when he came to the gates of the 
Celestial City; for there, said the man, he was received with sound of trumpet 
by a company of shining ones. He told also how all the bells in the city did 
ring for joy at his reception, and what golden garments he was clothed with; 
with many other things that now I shall forbear to relate. In a word, that man 
so told the story of Christian and his travels that my heart fell into a burning 
haste to be gone after him; nor could father or mother stay me. So I got from 
them, and am come thus far on my way.</P>

Bloody-man, Maul, and Slay-good. They said, moreover, that there was a foul 
fiend haunted the Valley of Humiliation; and that Christian was by him almost 
bereft of life. Besides, said they, you must go over the Valley of the Shadow of 
Death, where the hobgoblins are, where the light is darkness, where the way is 
full of snares, pits, traps, and gins. They told me also of Giant Despair, of 
Doubting Castle, and of the ruin that the pilgrims met with here. Further they 
said I must go over the Enchanted Ground, which was dangerous; And that after 
all this I should find a river, over which there was no bridge; and that that 
river did lie betwixt me and the Celestial country.</P>

<P id=vi.ix-p40><SPAN id=vi.ix-p40.1

<P id=vi.ix-p42><SPAN id=vi.ix-p42.1

Wordly Wiseman did lie there in wait to deceive. They said also, that there were 
Formality and Hypocrisy continually on the road. They said also, that By-ends, 
Talkative, or Demas, would go near to gather me up; that the Flatterer would 
catch me in his net; or that, with green-headed Ignorance, I would presume to go 
on to the gate, from whence he was sent back to the hole that was in the side of

<P id=vi.ix-p44><SPAN id=vi.ix-p44.1

me also of many that had tried that way of old, and that had gone a great way 
therein, to see if they could find something of the glory there that so many had 
so much talked of from time to time, and how they came back again, and befooled 
themselves for setting a foot out of doors in that path, to the satisfaction of 
all the country. And they named several that did so, as Obstinate and Pliable, 
Mistrust and Timorous, Turn-away and old Atheist, with several more; who, they 
said, had some of them gone far to see what they could find, but not one of them 
had found so much advantage by going as amounted to the weight of a feather.</P>

one Mr. Fearing, who was a pilgrim, and how he found his way so solitary that he 
never had a comfortable hour therein; also, that Mr. Despondency had like to 
have been starved therein: yea, and also (which I had almost forgot) that 
Christian himself, about whom there has been such a noise, after all his

<P id=vi.ix-p53>By this time they were got to the Enchanted Ground, where the 
air naturally tended to make one drowsy. And that place was all grown over with 
briars and thorns, excepting here and there, where was an enchanted arbor, upon 
which if a man sits, or in which if a man sleeps, it is a question, some say, 
whether ever he shall rise or wake again in this world. Over this forest, 
therefore, they went, both one and another, and Mr. Great-Heart went before, for 
that he was the guide; and Mr. Valiant-for-truth came behind, being rear-guard, 
for fear lest peradventure some fiend, or dragon, or giant, or thief, should 
fall upon their rear, and so do mischief. They went on here, each man with his 
sword drawn in his hand; for they knew it was a dangerous place. Also they 
cheered up one another as well as they could. Feeble-mind, Mr. Great-Heart 
commanded should come up after him; and Mr. Despondency was under the eye of Mr. 
Valiant.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p54>Now they had not gone far, but a great mist and darkness fell 
upon them all; so that they could scarce, for a great while, the one see the 
other. Wherefore they were forced, for some time, to feel one for another by 
words; for they walked not by sight. But any one must think, that here was but 
sorry going for the best of them all; but how much worse for the women and 
children, who both of feet and heart were but tender! Yet so it was, that 
through the encouraging words of him that led in the front, and of him that 
brought them up behind, they made a pretty good shift to wag along.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p55>The way also here was very wearisome, through dirt and 
slabbiness. Nor was there, on all this ground, so much as one inn or 
victualling-house wherein to refresh the feebler sort. Here, therefore, was 
grunting, and puffing, and sighing, while one tumbleth over a bush, another 
sticks fast in the dirt, and the children, some of them, lost their shoes in the 
mire; while one cries out, I am down; and another, Ho, where are you? and a 
third, The bushes have got such fast hold on me, I think I cannot get away from 
them.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p56>Then they came at an arbor, warm, and promising much refreshing 
to the pilgrims; for it was finely wrought above-head, beautified with greens, 
furnished with benches and settles. It also had in it a soft couch, whereon the 
weary might lean. This, you must think, all things considered, was tempting; for 
the pilgrims already began to be foiled with the badness of the way: but there 
was not one of them that made so much as a motion to stop there. Yea, for aught 
I could perceive, they continually gave so good heed to the advice of their 
guide, and he did so faithfully tell them of dangers, and of the nature of the 
dangers when they were at them, that usually, when they were nearest to them, 
they did most pluck up their spirits, and hearten one another to deny the flesh. 
This arbor was called The Slothful’s Friend, and was made on purpose to allure, 
if it might be, some of the pilgrims there to take up their rest when weary.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p57>I saw them in my dream, that they went on in this their solitary 
ground, till they came to a place at which a man is apt to lose his way. Now, 
though when it was light their guide could well enough tell how to miss those 
ways that led wrong, yet in the dark he was put to a stand. But he had in his 
pocket a map of all ways leading to or from the Celestial City; wherefore he 
struck a light (for he never goes without his tinder-box also), and takes a view 
of his book or map, which bids him to be careful in that place to turn to the 
right hand. And had he not been careful here to look in his map, they had all, 
in probability, been smothered in the mud; for just a little before them, and 
that at the end of the cleanest way too, was a pit, none knows how deep, full of 
nothing but mud, there made on purpose to destroy the pilgrims in.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p58>Then thought I with myself, Who that goeth on pilgrimage but 
would have one of these maps about him, that he may look, when he is at a stand, 
which is the way he must take?</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p59>Then they went on in this Enchanted Ground till they came to 
where there was another arbor, and it was built by the highway-side. And in that 
arbor there lay two men, whose names were Heedless and Too-bold. These two went 
thus far on pilgrimage; but here, being wearied with their journey, they sat 
down to rest themselves, and so fell fast asleep. When the pilgrims saw them, 
they stood still, and shook their heads; for they knew that the sleepers were in 
a pitiful case. Then they consulted what to do, whether to go on and leave them 
in their sleep, or to step to them and try to awake them; so they concluded to 
go to them and awake them, that is, if they could; but with this caution, 
namely, to take heed that they themselves did not sit down nor embrace the 
offered benefit of that arbor.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p60>So they went in, and spake to the men, and called each by his 
name, for the guide, it seems, did know them; but there was no voice nor answer. 
Then the guide did shake them, and do what he could to disturb them. Then said 
one of them, I will pay you when I take my money. At which the guide shook his 
head. I will fight so long as I can hold my sword in my hand, said the other. At 
that, one of the children laughed.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p61>Then said Christiana, What is the meaning of this? The guide 
said, They talk in their sleep. If you strike them, beat them, or whatever else 
you do to them, they will answer you after this fashion; or, as one of them said 
in old time, when the waves of the sea did beat upon him, and he slept as one 
upon the mast of a ship, <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p61.1 
osisRef="Bible:Prov.23.34 Bible:Prov.23.35" 
parsed="|Prov|23|34|0|0;|Prov|23|35|0|0" passage="Pr 23:34,35">Prov. 
23:34,35</SCRIPREF>, When I awake, I will seek it yet again. You know, when men 
talk in their sleep, they say any thing; but their words are not governed either 
by faith or reason. There is an incoherency in their words now, as there was 
before betwixt their going on pilgrimage and sitting down here. This, then, is 
the mischief of it: when heedless ones go on pilgrimage, ‘tis twenty to one but 
they are served thus. For this Enchanted Ground is one of the last refuges that 
the enemy to pilgrims has; wherefore it is, as you see, placed almost at the end 
of the way, and so it standeth against us with the more advantage. For when, 
thinks the enemy, will these fools be so desirous to sit down as when they are 
weary? and when so like to be weary as when almost at their journey’s end? 
Therefore it is, I say, that the Enchanted Ground is placed so nigh to the land 
Beulah, and so near the end of their race. Wherefore let pilgrims look to 
themselves, lest it happen to them as it has done to these that, as you see, are 
fallen asleep, and none can awake them.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p62>Then the pilgrims desired with trembling to go forward; only 
they prayed their guide to strike a light, that they might go the rest of their 
way by the help of the light of a lantern. So he struck a light, and they went 
by the help of that through the rest of this way, though the darkness was very 
great. <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p62.1 osisRef="Bible:2Pet.1.19" 
parsed="|2Pet|1|19|0|0" passage="2 Pe 1:19">2 Pet. 1:19</SCRIPREF>. But the 
children began to be sorely weary, and they cried out unto him that loveth 
pilgrims, to make their way more comfortable. So by that they had gone a little 
further, a wind arose that drove away the fog, so the air became more clear. Yet 
they were not off (by much) of the Enchanted Ground; only now they could see one 
another better, and the way wherein they should walk.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p63>Now when they were almost at the end of this ground, they 
perceived that a little before them was a solemn noise, as of one that was much 
concerned. So they went on and looked before them: and behold they saw, as they 
thought, a man upon his knees, with hands and eyes lifted up, and speaking, as 
they thought, earnestly to one that was above. They drew nigh, but could not 
tell what he said; so they went softly till he had done. When he had done, he 
got up, and began to run towards the Celestial City. Then Mr. Great-Heart called 
after him, saying, Soho, friend, let us have your company, if you go, as I 
suppose you do, to the Celestial City. So the man stopped, and they came up to 
him. But as soon as Mr. Honest saw him, he said, I know this man. Then said Mr. 
Valiant-for-truth, Prithee, who is it? It is one, said he, that comes from 
whereabout I dwelt. His name is Standfast; he is certainly a right good 
pilgrim.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p64>So they came up to one another; and presently Standfast said to 
old Honest, Ho, father Honest, are you there? Aye, said he, that I am, as sure 
as you are there. Right glad am I, said Mr. Standfast, that I have found you on 
this road. And as glad am I, said the other, that I espied you on your knees. 
Then Mr. Standfast blushed, and said, But why, did you see me? Yes, that I did, 
quoth the other, and with my heart was glad at the sight. Why, what did you 
think? said Standfast. Think! said old Honest; what could I think? I thought we 
had an honest man upon the road, and therefore should have his company by and 
by. If you thought not amiss, said Standfast, how happy am I! But if I be not as 
I should, ‘t is I alone must bear it. That is true, said the other; but your 
fear doth further confirm me that things are right betwixt the Prince of 
pilgrims and your soul. For he saith, “Blessed is the man that feareth always.”

<P id=vi.ix-p66><SPAN id=vi.ix-p66.1 
style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">STANDFAST:</SPAN> Why, we are, as you see, upon

also of the manner of the death with which this place destroyeth men. Those that 
die here, die of no violent distemper: the death which such die is not grievous 
to them. For he that goeth away in a sleep, begins that journey with desire and

passage="Pr 10:7">Prov. 10:7</SCRIPREF>. But let me go on with my tale. As I was 
thus musing, as I said, there was one in very pleasant attire, but old, who 
presented herself to me, and offered me three things, to wit, her body, her 
purse, and her bed. Now the truth is, I was both weary and sleepy. I am also as 
poor as an owlet, and that perhaps the witch knew. Well, I repulsed her once and 
again, but she put by my repulses, and smiled. Then I began to be angry; but she 
mattered that nothing at all. Then she made offers again, and said, if I would 
be ruled by her, she would make me great and happy; for, said she, I am the 
mistress of the world, and men are made happy by me. Then I asked her name, and 
she told me it was Madam Bubble. This set me further from her; but she still 
followed me with enticements. Then I betook me, as you saw, to my knees, and 
with hands lifted up, and cries, I prayed to Him that had said he would help. 
So, just as you came up, the gentlewoman went her way. Then I continued to give 
thanks for this my</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p69>great deliverance; for I verily believe she intended no good, 
but rather sought to make stop of me in my journey.</P>

then preferring the excellences of this life. She is a bold and impudent slut: 
she will talk with any man. She always laugheth poor pilgrims to scorn, but 
highly commends the rich. If there be one cunning to get money in a place, she 
will speak well of him from house to house. She loveth banqueting and feasting 
mainly well; she is always at one full table or another. She has given it out in 
some places that she is a goddess, and therefore some do worship her. She has 
her time, and open places of cheating; and she will say and avow it, that none 
can show a good comparable to hers. She promiseth to dwell with children’s 
children, if they will but love her and make much of her. She will cast out of 
her purse gold like dust in some places and to some persons. She loves to be 
sought after, spoken well of, and to lie in the bosoms of men. She is never 
weary of commending her commodities, and she loves them most that think best of 
her. She will promise to some crowns and kingdoms, if they will but take her

<P id=vi.ix-p83>After this, I beheld until they were come into the land of 
Beulah, where the sun shineth night and day. Here, because they were weary, they 
betook themselves a while to rest. And because this country was common for 
pilgrims, and because the orchards and vineyards that were here belonged to the 
King of the Celestial country, therefore they were licensed to make bold with 
any of his things. But a little while soon refreshed them here; for the bells 
did so ring, and the trumpets continually sound so melodiously, that they could 
not sleep, and yet they received as much refreshing as if they had slept their 
sleep ever so soundly. Here also all the noise of them that walked the streets 
was, More pilgrims are come to town! And another would answer, saying, And so 
many went over the water, and were let in at the golden gates to-day! They would 
cry again, There is now a legion of shining ones just come to town, by which we 
know that there are more pilgrims upon the road; for here they come to wait for 
them, and to comfort them after all their sorrow. Then the pilgrims got up, and 
walked to and fro. But how were their ears now filled with heavenly noises, and 
their eyes delighted with celestial visions! In this land they heard nothing, 
saw nothing, felt nothing, smelt nothing, tasted nothing that was offensive to 
their stomach or mind; only when they tasted of the water of the river over 
which they were to go, they thought that it tasted a little bitterish to the 
palate; but it proved sweeter when it was down.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p84>In this place there was a record kept of the names of them that 
had been pilgrims of old, and a history of all the famous acts that they had 
done. It was here also much discoursed, how the river to some had had its 
flowings, and what ebbings it has had while others have gone over. It has been 
in a manner dry for some, while it has overflowed its banks for others.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p85>In this place the children of the town would go into the King’s 
gardens, and gather nosegays for the pilgrims, and bring them to them with much 
affection. Here also grew camphire, with spikenard and saffron, calamus and 
cinnamon, with all the trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes, with all chief 
spices. With these the pilgrims’ chambers were perfumed while they stayed here; 
and with these were their bodies anointed, to prepare them to go over the river, 
when the time appointed was come.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p86>Now, while they lay here, and waited for the good hour, there 
was a noise in the town that there was a post come from the Celestial City, with 
matter of great importance to one Christiana, the wife of Christian the pilgrim. 
So inquiry was made for her, and the house was found out where she was. So the 
post presented her with a letter. The contents were, Hail, good woman; I bring 
thee tidings that the Master calleth for thee, and expecteth that thou shouldst 
stand in his presence in clothes of immortality within these ten days.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p87>When he had read this letter to her, he gave her therewith a 
sure token that he was a true messenger, and was come to bid her make haste to 
be gone. The token was, an arrow with a point sharpened with love, let easily 
into her heart, which by degrees wrought so effectually with her, that at the 
time appointed she must be gone.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p88>When Christiana saw that her time was come, and that she was the 
first of this company that was to go over, she called for Mr. Great-Heart her 
guide, and told him how matters were. So he told her he was heartily glad of the 
news, and could have been glad had the post come for him. Then she bid him that 
he should give advice how all things should be prepared for her journey. So he 
told her, saying, Thus and thus it must be, and we that survive will accompany 
you to the river-side.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p89>Then she called for her children, and gave them her blessing, 
and told them that she had read with comfort the mark that was set in their 
foreheads, and was glad to see them with her there, and that they had kept their 
garments so white. Lastly, she bequeathed to the poor that little she had, and 
commanded her sons and daughters to be ready against the messenger should come 
for them.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p90>When she had spoken these words to her guide, and to her 
children, she called for Mr. Valiant-for-truth, and said unto him, Sir, you have 
in all places showed yourself true-hearted; be faithful unto death, and my King 
will give you a crown of life. <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p90.1 osisRef="Bible:Rev.2.10" 
parsed="|Rev|2|10|0|0" passage="Rev 2:10">Rev. 2:10</SCRIPREF>. I would also 
entreat you to have an eye to my children; and if at any time you see them 
faint, speak comfortably to them. For my daughters, my sons’ wives, they have 
been faithful, and a fulfilling of the promise upon them will be their end. But 
she gave Mr. Standfast a ring.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p91>Then she called for old Mr. Honest, and said of him, “Behold an 
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!” <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p91.1 
osisRef="Bible:John.1.47" parsed="|John|1|47|0|0" passage="Jn 1:47">John 
1:47</SCRIPREF>. Then said he, I wish you a fair day when you set out for Mount 
Sion, and shall be glad to see that you go over the river dry-shod. But she 
answered, Come wet, come dry, I long to be gone; for however the weather is in 
my journey, I shall have time enough when I come there to sit down and rest me 
and dry me.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p92>Then came in that good man Mr. Ready-to-halt, to see her. So she 
said to him, Thy travel hitherto has been with difficulty; but that will make 
thy rest the sweeter. Watch, and be ready; for at an hour when you think not, 
the messenger may come.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p93>After him came Mr. Despondency and his daughter Much-afraid, to 
whom she said, You ought, with thankfulness, forever to remember your 
deliverance from the hands of Giant Despair, and out of Doubting Castle. The 
effect of that mercy is, that you are brought with safety hither. Be ye 
watchful, and cast away fear; be sober, and hope to the end.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p94>Then she said to Mr. Feeble-mind, Thou wast delivered from the 
mouth of Giant Slay-good, that thou mightest live in the light of the living, 
and see thy King with comfort. Only I advise thee to repent of thine aptness to 
fear and doubt of his goodness, before he sends for thee; lest thou shouldst, 
when he comes, be forced to stand before him for that fault with blushing.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p95>Now the day drew on that Christiana must be gone. So the road 
was full of people to see her take her journey. But behold, all the banks beyond 
the river were full of horses and chariots, which were come down from above to 
accompany her to the city gate. So she came forth, and entered the river, with a 
beckon of farewell to those that followed her. The last words that she was heard 
to say were, I come, Lord, to be with thee and bless thee! So her children and 
friends returned to their place, for those that waited for Christiana had 
carried her out of their sight. So she went and called, and entered in at the 
gate with all the ceremonies of joy that her husband Christian had entered with 
before her. At her departure, the children wept. But Mr. Great-Heart and Mr. 
Valiant played upon the welltuned cymbal and harp for joy. So all departed to 
their respective places.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p96>In process of time there came a post to the town again, and his 
business was with Mr. Ready-to-halt. So he inquired him out, and said, I am come 
from Him whom thou hast loved and followed, though upon crutches; and my message 
is to tell thee, that he expects thee at his table to sup with him in his 
kingdom, the next day after Easter; wherefore prepare thyself for this journey. 
Then he also gave him a token that he was a true messenger, saying, “I have 
broken thy golden bowl, and loosed thy silver cord.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p96.1 
osisRef="Bible:Eccl.12.6" parsed="|Eccl|12|6|0|0" passage="Ecc 12:6">Eccles. 
12:6</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p97>After this, Mr. Ready-to-halt called for his fellow-pilgrims, 
and told them, saying, I am sent for, and God shall surely visit you also. So he 
desired Mr. Valiant to make his will. And because he had nothing to bequeath to 
them that should survive him but his crutches, and his good wishes, therefore 
thus he said, These crutches I bequeath to my son that shall tread in my steps, 
with a hundred warm wishes that he may prove better than I have been.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p98>Then he thanked Mr. Great-Heart for his conduct and kindness, 
and so addressed himself to his journey. When he came to the brink of the river, 
he said, Now I shall have no more need of these crutches, since yonder are 
chariots and horses for me to ride on. The last words he was heard to say were, 
Welcome life! So he went his way.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p99>After this, Mr. Feeble-mind had tidings brought him that the 
post sounded his horn at his chamber door. Then he came in, and told him, 
saying, I am come to tell thee that thy Master hath need of thee, and that in a 
very little time thou must behold his face in brightness. And take this as a 
token of the truth of my message: “Those that look out at the windows shall be 
darkened.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p99.1 osisRef="Bible:Eccl.12.3" 
parsed="|Eccl|12|3|0|0" passage="Ecc 12:3">Eccles. 12:3</SCRIPREF>. Then Mr. 
Feeble-mind called for his friends, and told them what errand had been brought 
unto him, and what token he had received of the truth of the message. Then he 
said, since I have nothing to bequeath to any, to what purpose should I make a 
will? As for my feeble mind, that I will leave behind me, for that I shall have 
no need of it in the place whither I go, nor is it worth bestowing upon the 
poorest pilgrims: wherefore, when I am gone, I desire that you, Mr. Valiant, 
would bury it in a dunghill. This done, and the day being come on which he was 
to depart, he entered the river as the rest. His last words were, Hold out, 
faith and patience! So he went over to the other side.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p100>When days had many of them passed away, Mr. Despondency was 
sent for; for a post was come, and brought this message to him: Trembling man! 
these are to summon thee to be ready with the King by the next Lord’s day, to 
shout for joy for thy deliverance from all thy doubtings. And, said the 
messenger, that my message is true, take this for a proof: so he gave him a 
grasshopper to be a burden unto him. <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p100.1 
osisRef="Bible:Eccl.12.5" parsed="|Eccl|12|5|0|0" 
passage="Ecc 12:5">Ecclesiastes 12:5</SCRIPREF>.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p101>Now Mr. Despondency’s daughter, whose name was Much-afraid, 
said, when she heard what was done, that she would go with her father. Then Mr. 
Despondency said to his friends, Myself and my daughter, you know what we have 
been, and how troublesomely we have behaved ourselves in every company. My will 
and my daughter’s is, that our desponds and slavish fears be by no man ever 
received, from the day of our departure, forever; for I know that after my death 
they will offer themselves to others. For, to be plain with you, they are ghosts 
which we entertained when we first began to be pilgrims, and could never shake 
them off after; and they will walk about, and seek entertainment of the 
pilgrims: but for our sakes, shut the doors upon them. When the time was come 
for them to depart, they went up to the brink of the river. The last words of 
Mr. Despondency were, Farewell, night; welcome, day! His daughter went through 
the river singing, but none could understand what she said.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p102>Then it came to pass a while after, that there was a post in 
the town that inquired for Mr. Honest. So he came to the house where he was, and 
delivered to his hand these lines: Thou art commanded to be ready against this 
day seven-night, to present thyself before thy Lord at his Father’s house. And 
for a token that my message is true, “All the daughters of music shall be 
brought low.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p102.1 osisRef="Bible:Eccl.12.4" 
parsed="|Eccl|12|4|0|0" passage="Ecc 12:4">Eccles. 12:4</SCRIPREF>. Then Mr. 
Honest called for his friends, and said unto them, I die, but shall make no 
will. As for my honesty, it shall go with me; let him that comes after be told 
of this. When the day that he was to be gone was come, he addressed himself to 
go over the river. Now the river at that time over-flowed its banks in some 
places; but Mr. Honest, in his lifetime, had spoken to one Good-conscience to 
meet him there, the which he also did, and lent him his hand, and so helped him 
over. The last words of Mr. Honest were, Grace reigns! So he left the world.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p103>After this it was noised abroad that Mr. Valiant-for-truth was 
taken with a summons by the same post as the other, and had this for a token 
that the summons was true, “That his pitcher was broken at the fountain.” 
<SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p103.1 osisRef="Bible:Eccl.12.6" parsed="|Eccl|12|6|0|0" 
passage="Ecc 12:6">Eccl. 12:6</SCRIPREF>. When he understood it, he called for 
his friends, and told them of it. Then said he, I am going to my Father’s; and 
though with great difficulty I have got hither, yet now I do not repent me of 
all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am. My sword I give to him that 
shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my courage and skill to him that can get 
it. My marks and scars I carry with me, to be a witness for me that I have 
fought His battles who will now be my rewarder. When the day that he must go 
hence was come, many accompanied him to the river-side, into which as he went, 
he said, “Death, where is thy sting?” And as he went down deeper, he said, 
“Grave, where is thy victory?” <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p103.2 
osisRef="Bible:1Cor.15.55" parsed="|1Cor|15|55|0|0" passage="1 Co 15:55">1 Cor. 
15:55</SCRIPREF>. So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the 
other side.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p104>Then there came forth a summons for Mr. Standfast. This Mr. 
Standfast was he whom the rest of the pilgrims found upon his knees in the 
Enchanted Ground. And the post brought it him open in his hands: the contents 
thereof were, that he must prepare for a change of life, for his Master was not 
willing that he should be so far from him any longer. At this Mr. Standfast was 
put into a muse. Nay, said the messenger, you need not doubt of the truth of my 
message; for here is a token of the truth thereof, “Thy wheel is broken at the 
cistern.” <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p104.1 osisRef="Bible:Eccl.12.6" 
parsed="|Eccl|12|6|0|0" passage="Ecc 12:6">Eccles. 12:6</SCRIPREF>. Then he 
called to him Mr. Great-Heart, who was their guide, and said unto him, Sir, 
although it was not my hap to be much in your good company during the days of my 
pilgrimage, yet, since the time I knew you, you have been profitable to me. When 
I came from home, I left behind me a wife and five small children; let me 
entreat you, at your return, (for I know that you go and return to your Master’s 
house, in hopes that you may yet be a conductor to more of the holy pilgrims,) 
that you send to my family, and let them be acquainted with all that hath and 
shall happen unto me. Tell them moreover of my happy arrival at this place, and 
of the present and late blessed condition I am in. Tell them also of Christian 
and Christiana his wife, and how she and her children came after her husband. 
Tell them also of what a happy end she made, and whither she is gone. I have 
little or nothing to send to my family, unless it be prayers and tears for them; 
of which it will suffice that you acquaint them, if peradventure they may 
prevail. When Mr. Standfast had thus set things in order, and the time being 
come for him to haste him away, he also went down to the river. Now there was a 
great calm at that time in the river; wherefore Mr. Standfast, when he was about 
half-way in, stood a while, and talked with his companions that had waited upon 
him thither. And he said, This river has been a terror to many; yea, the 
thoughts of it also have often frightened me; but now methinks I stand easy; my 
foot is fixed upon that on which the feet of the priests that bare the ark of 
the covenant stood while Israel went over Jordan. <SCRIPREF id=vi.ix-p104.2 
osisRef="Bible:Josh.3.17" parsed="|Josh|3|17|0|0" passage="Jos 3:17">Josh. 
3:17</SCRIPREF>. The waters indeed are to the palate bitter, and to the stomach 
cold; yet the thoughts of what I am going to, and of the convoy that waits for 
me on the other side, do lie as a glowing coal at my heart. I see myself now at 
the end of my journey; my toilsome days are ended. I am going to see that head 
which was crowned with thorns, and that face which was spit upon for me. I have 
formerly lived by hearsay and faith; but now I go where I shall live by sight, 
and shall be with him in whose company I delight myself. I have loved to hear my 
Lord spoken of; and wherever I have seen the print of his shoe in the earth, 
there I have coveted to set my foot too. His name has been to me as a civet-box; 
yea, sweeter than all perfumes. His voice to me has been most sweet, and his 
countenance I have more desired than they that have most desired the light of 
the sun. His words I did use to gather for my food, and for antidotes against my 
faintings. He hath held me, and hath kept me from mine iniquities; yea, my steps 
hath he strengthened in his way.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p105>Now, while he was thus in discourse, his countenance changed; 
his strong man bowed under him: and after he had said, Take me, for I come unto 
thee, he ceased to be seen of them.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p106>But glorious it was to see how the open region was filled with 
horses and chariots, with trumpeters and pipers, with singers and players upon 
stringed instruments, to welcome the pilgrims as they went up, and followed one 
another in at the beautiful gate of the city.</P>
<P id=vi.ix-p107>As for Christiana’s children, the four boys that Christiana 
brought, with their wives and children, I did not stay where I was till they 
were gone over. Also, since I came away, I heard one say that they were yet 
alive, and so would be for the increase of the church, in that place where they 
were, for a time.</P>
<P class=div2>Farewell</P>
<P id=vi.x-p1>Should it be my lot to go that way again, I may give those that 
desire it an account of what I here am silent about: meantime I bid my 
reader</P>
<P id=vi.x-p2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; text-size: large">FAREWELL.</P>
