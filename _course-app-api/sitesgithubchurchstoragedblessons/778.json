When angels are specially prominent.</p>\r\n<p>1. The time of the judges. Destitute of direct Revelation or prophetic guidance.</p>\r\n<p>2. The times of captivity. Under great stress and trial. The Angel speaks to Daniel - Words of encouragement. vs. 12. &quot;Fear not Daniel&quot; Perhaps the signs of terror were still manifested in Daniel and the angel spoke encouragingly to him. vs. 19. &quot;Peace be unto thee&quot; &quot;Be strong yea be strong&quot; &quot;When he had spoken unto me I was strengthened.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I. The Combatants - </p>\r\n<h3>A. The Opponents. </h3>\r\n<h4>1. They are Spiritual. vs. 13 &quot;The Prince of the Kingdom of Persia.&quot; vs. 20.</h4>\r\n<p>&quot;The Prince of Grecia&quot; Psa. 2:2 &quot;The Kings of the earth.&quot; There is a spiritual king behind the earthly. Eph.6:12.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;For we wrestle (fight- struggle-battle) not against flesh and blood - (contending only with physical opponents) but against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot; </p>\r\n<h4>2.They Are Numerous - </h4>\r\n<p>There are many ranks of evil which are leagued against us under the leadership of Satan. These evil spirits have a hierarchy of different orders and different ranks. &quot;Principalities Powers Rulers of the darkness of this world Spiritual wickedness.&quot;</p>\r\n<h4>3.They Are Deceiving -</h4>\r\n<p>Gen. 3:1 &quot;The serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field.&quot; I Tim. 4:1 &quot;now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.&quot; II Tim. 3:13 &quot;But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived.&quot; </p>\r\n<h3>B.  The Proponents -</h3>\r\n<h4>1. The Angels vs. 13 </h4>\r\n<p>&quot;Michael one of the chief princes came to help me.&quot; Gabriel. Heb. 1:14. &quot;Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.&quot; </p>\r\n<h4>2.Gabriel- vs. 18</h4>\r\n<p>&quot;Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me.&quot; Psa. 91:11; Heb. 13:5 &quot;He hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.&quot; </p>\r\n<p>II. The Length of The Battle -</p>\r\n<p>vs. 13 &quot;Withstood me one and twenty days.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>1. From the Time Daniel started to pray. vs. 12</p>\r\n<p>&quot;From the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand&quot;</p>\r\n<p>2. For twenty one days &quot;Withstood me&quot; vs. 13</p>\r\n<p>Remember the devil sends his workers to intercept the messenger of God that is coming with the answer to your prayer. Keep praying -the answer is on the way - though it tarry wait for it.</p>\r\n<p>III. The Cause of The Battle.</p>\r\n<p>Hell wants to keep people in ignorance. Keep them bound -keep them in unbelief.</p>\r\n<p>1. The Revelation of God's Secrets vs. 14</p>\r\n<p>&quot;I am come to make thee understand.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>2. The Revelation of the Future. vs. 14 </p>\r\n<p>&quot;What shall befall thy people in the latter days.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>3. The Revelation of Truth vs. 21 </p>\r\n<p>&quot;I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth.&quot; Jesus said Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.&quot; The Adversary wants to keep us from the truth. Paul was given a thorn -because of abundance of revelation. </p>\r\n<p>IV. The Consequence of the Battle.</p>\r\n<p>1. Daniel was Victorious - He prayed through vs. 12  He received the answer.</p>\r\n<p>2. The Angel was Victorious. Would he have gotten through if Daniel gave up?</p>\r\n<p>3. The Enemy was Defeated &quot;Resist the devil and he will flee from you.&quot; </p>\r\n<h2>4. God's Kingdom Advanced. What if Daniel had failed?</h2>"},"type":"READ_HTML_FILE"}
