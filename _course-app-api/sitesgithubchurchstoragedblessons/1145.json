He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.\r\n \r\n> Joh 21:16 &mdash; He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?

(3 Times Peter had denied Jesus and 3 times Jesus asks \"Do You Love me?\")\r\n\r\n## What Does a Life Without Faith Look Like?\r\n\r\nIt is possible to live a live benefiting from the faith of others and yet have none of your own. It is Difficult to imagine a world without faith in God, because even those who do not Believe benefit in many ways from those who do.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- What would a world without God look like? \r\n- Constitution would look like swiss cheese if all references to scripture and God were removed.\r\n- Secular music is spotted with Biblical references.\r\n- Praying Parents/Pastor but no prayer life of your own.\r\n- God has the monopoly on \"GOODNESS\" -- \r\n\r\n>  Mr 10:18 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? **there is none good but one, that is, God**.\r\n\r\n> \"Man is the Cosmic Orphan. He is the only creature in the universe who asks, \"Why?\" Other animals have instincts to guide them, but man has learned to ask questions. \"Who am I?\" man asks. \"Why am I here? Where am I going?\" Since the Enlightenment, when **he threw off the shackles of religion**, man has tried to answer these questions without reference to God. But **the answers that came back were not exhilarating, but dark and terrible**. \r\n\r\n- \"You are the accidental by-product of nature, a result of matter plus time plus chance. \r\n- There is no reason for your existence. \r\n- All you face is death.\"\r\n- No hope beyond the grave\r\n\r\nLife without God, that is Faith in God, leads only to a grave. (wicked and good alike)\r\n\r\nLife without Faith in God, concludes with death. No matter what happens in the mean time, eventually you will cease to exist.\r\n\r\nWe are prisoners who await our execution. \r\nHaving no higher purpose, significance or value.\r\n\r\nAdvances in sciences like medicine&hellip;no permanent value because the universe is DOOMED. Life is absurd. We work and sacrifice to accomplish things that will not deter the outcome -- and ever expanding universe that will eventually just cease to exist with no memory or proof it had ever existed.\r\n\r\nA life without faith in God, cannot meaningfully answer our greatest questions: Why Am I here? What is the Meaning and purpose of my life? AT best we can agree to a level of \"SELF DELUSION\"&hellip;let's PRETEND it all has meaning (evening though we know it doesn't) and fool ourselves.\r\n\r\n> \"in killing God, man has also killed himself\"\r\n\r\nSin is a hard taskmaster!\r\n\r\n## What Does the Life of Faith Look Like? (Hebrews 11)\r\n\r\nBiblical Christianity therefore provides the two conditions necessary for a meaningful, valuable, and purposeful life for man: God and immortality. Because of this, we can live consistently and happily.\r\n\r\nHebrews 11:\r\n\r\n1. v.4 Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice\r\n\r\n**The favor of God is what gives any WORK permanent value.**\r\n\r\n2. v.5 Enoch was translated\r\n\r\n**How horrible the world is&hellip; Enoch escaped it even by passing the grave by faith.**\r\n\r\n3. v.7 Noah Prepared an Ark and Became heir of Righteousness\r\n\r\n**In the face of bad NEWS, there's always a PLAN and therefor a DESIGNER.**\r\n\r\n> **Romans 8:28** And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.\r\n\r\n4. v.8 Abraham journeyed not knowing where to\r\n\r\nBy faith we access to an eternal strength to move forward even into the unknown with CONFIDENCE.\r\n\r\n5. v.9 Abraham sojourned in the Land of Promise\r\n6. v.17 Abraham offered Isaac\r\n7. v.20 Isaac Blessed Jacob and Isaac Prophetically\r\n8. v.21 Jacob Blessed both sons of Joseph\r\n9. v.22 Joseph gave commandment concerning his bones (God will bring us out someday)\r\n10. v.23 Moses was hid three months\r\n11. v.24 Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter\r\n12. v.27 Moses forsook Egypt\r\n13. v.29 Israel passed through the Red Sea\r\n14. v.30 Walls of Jericho Fell\r\n15. v.31 Rahab perished not\r\n\r\n## What Does the Life of Faith Look Like?
