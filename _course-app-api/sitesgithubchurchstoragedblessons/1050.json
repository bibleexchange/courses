Pharaoh was full of Fear and Anxiety\r\n\r\nThe only thing worse than being in trouble is not seeing a way out.\r\n\r\n### B. Joseph Stands Ready.\r\n\r\nIt had been a long journey from the household of Jacob to having an audience with Pharoah.\r\n\r\n - Struggled with God's Dealings - Mystery, What do these dreams mean?\r\n - Struggled with Himself - To Tell or Not to Tell?\r\n - Struggled with His Family - His Motives questioned by those closest to him.\r\n\r\n**THEME**: The battle hasn't been pleasureable but it has taught us some things. The devil wants us to believe we have been weakened, scarred and become unfit for battle by the fight. But Joseph is shown here not as **BEATEN**, but **BATTLE TESTED**. \r\n\r\n## I. How to Profit in Loss.\r\n\r\n### A. Tempered\r\n\r\nSteel is an alloy of iron used in construction, the manufacture of metal tools and other applications. In uses exposing it to a lot of wear and tear, the steel must be hardened and then tempered so it stands up to the level of usage it's intended for.\r\n\r\n>1 Peter 5:10 -- But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.\r\n\r\nThe Key is our FAITH and not our SUFFERING. (Pain Alone will not strengthen you.)-----> Steel Must be alloyed with other metals if it doesn't have sufficient carbon content. [God will give you an answer of peace!]\r\n\r\n### B. Because giving up isn't one of your options!\r\n\r\n> Philippians 4:11-13 --Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. 12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. \r\n\r\n### C. Your reward is from God!\r\n\r\n> Colossians 3:23-24 -- And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; 24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.\r\n\r\n## II. The Answer is not in You, but That is Ok.\r\n\r\n> It is not in me&hellip;\r\n\r\n- Once felt invincible, unwise in the battle. -- Had all the answers.\r\n- The NOVICE wins the first fight and is in more danger than before.\r\n- The VETERAN recognizes his own frailty and glories in the might of Christ.\r\n\r\n- I know a man who can.\r\n- God has somethings he needs to put in us!\r\n\r\n## III. God Has an Answer of Peace and He will Share It.\r\n\r\n> Psalm 6:6-10 -- 6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies. 8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. 9 The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer. 10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.\r\n\r\n- Let the Steel Cool.
