Consider the Pattern\r\n\r\n> Philippians 2:15 &mdash; That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;\r\n\r\n## Introduction: Motivated by Love, vs. 1\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n- The Church at Philippi was dear to Paul and He to them. (phil. 4:1 \"my joy and crown\")\r\n- They followed news of Him through his journeys, until they lost word of him when he was arrested.\r\n- They sent Epaphroditus to find Paul and bring him an offering and encourage Paul in their love and support.\r\n- In Philippians, Paul Writes of CHRISTIAN LIVING: 1) Philosophy 2) Pattern 3) Prize 4) Power of/for Christian Living\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n- If You have Benefited from Following Christ: consolation, love, fellowship, mercy, etc. \r\n\r\n> Php 2:1 ¶ If there be therefore any consolation/encouragement in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,\r\n\r\n**IF ... ** Paul's choice of approach here for motivating the church in Phillipi is THE REALITY AND BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL. \r\n\r\n- What am I being motivated by?\r\n- Many are moved entirely by what their flesh wants, what is familiar or comfortable.\r\n\r\nHas the God we serve been GOOD to us? Has it been **DIFFERENT** since Jesus saved your soul?\r\n\r\n- Then BE THIS KIND OF PEOPLE ... Taking inventory of the blessings of God in our life should move us:\r\n\t- Speak what We have Heard from God\r\n\t- Love as We have been Loved\r\n\t- Encourage as We have been Encouraged.\r\n\t- Be Mercififul as We have Received Mercy.\r\n\r\nWe are not to be mere RESERVOIRS, but CONDUITS of God's consolation/encouragement, comfort, love, fellowship, mercy.\r\n\r\n> Mt 10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: **freely ye have received, freely give**.\r\n\r\n> A famous preacher recently died, much was talked about his networth and and his properties and I was asked at work if I knew the preacher. Someone jokingly chimed in and asked why, \"Don't you have a big mansion?\" Another co-worker responded for me, \"Steve's not that kind of preacher.\"\r\n\r\nIf you really FOLLOW Jesus, you'll stand out. - THEN:\r\n\r\n## Unity of Believers, vs. 2\r\n\r\n> 2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.\r\n\r\n- (Likeminded) Earnestly moving in the same direction.\r\n\r\n- An important topic of Philippians is advice against \"quarreling\" in the church.\r\n\r\n> 2:3 \"Let nothing be done through strife.\"\r\n> 2:5 \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.\"\r\n> 2:14 \"Do all things without murmurings and disputings.\"\r\n\r\n- Ch. 4, 2 Women in the Church not of the \"SAME MIND\". (Ph. 4:2 Eudias and Syntiche)\r\n> Vernon McGee, \"Odius and Soon-Touchy\" = sparks will fly\r\n\r\n## Esteem Each Other Better, vs. 3\r\n\r\n> 3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.\r\n \r\n- Let NOTHING [NO THING] be down through STRIFE (factions/clicks/division) or VAINGLORY (extensive pride in one's achievements). \r\n- We call each other \"Brother\" and \"Sister\" because we are a FAMILY.\r\n \r\n ## Look on the Things of of Others, v.4 \r\n \r\n> 4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.\r\n \r\n I'm a very private person and by extension of that not a very \"nosy\" one. This detail of my personality challenges me daily in obedience to this Word.\r\n \r\n> Ga 6:2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.\r\n \r\n\"Look after each other.\"\r\n \r\n ## The Pattern is Christ, v.5-11\r\n \r\n >  5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\r\n \r\n - He Made Himself of No Reputation\r\n - He Took the Form of a Servant\r\n - He Humbled Himself in Obedience (even unto death)\r\n \r\n ## Live in Obedience, v. 12,13\r\n \r\n > 12 ¶ Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. 13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\r\n \r\n - Work Out What God Works In\r\n - Paul is not encouraging believers to live in a continuous condition of nervousness and anxiety. \r\n - Fear: Carefulness, Reverance, Respect\r\n - Have we lost our sense of AWE for the Life in the Spirit?\r\n  \r\n ## Shine As Lights, v. 14-16\r\n  \r\n > 14 ¶ Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; \r\n \r\n > 16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.\r\n \r\n - Paul is tenderly entreating them, \"Please, Don't Be Like the World. You've received better than that.\"\r\n \r\n ## Paul's Conclusion, v.17-30\r\n \r\n > 17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. 19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 20 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. 21 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. 22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. 23 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. 24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. 25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. 26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. 27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 28 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: 30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.\r\n \r\n "},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
