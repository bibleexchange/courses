The scene is still the throne, the Elders, the Living creatures.</p>\r\n\t<p>This prophecy is in connection with the Church, but not of the Church. Also, this prophecy has its description given in Heaven, but its fulfillment on the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Position of the Book</h2>\r\n<h3>v. 1 \"In the right hand\"</h3>\r\n<p>The place of power.</p>\r\n<h3>v. 1 \"Of Him that sat on the throne.\"</h3>\r\n<p>The place of rule of authority.</p>\r\n<h2>The Characteristics of the Book</h2>\r\n<h3>v. 1 \"A book written within\"</h3>\r\n<p>A scroll - about judgment</p>\r\n<p>The book contained a revelation and demonstration of things to come at the consummation of this present age after the Rapture of the Church.</p>\r\n<h3>v. 1 \"On the backside, sealed with seven seals\"</h3>\r\n<p>Reserved judgment. This is not a familiar judgment seen. This is an exceptional administration of justice never before witnessed.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Reserved unto the Day of Judgment</blockquote>\r\n<h2>The Dignity of the Book</h2>\r\n<h3>The question by the angel</h3>\r\n<blockquote>v. 2 \"Who is worthy to open the book\"</blockquote>\r\n<h3>The answer to the question</h3>\r\n<blockquote>v. 3 \"No man in heaven, or in earth, neither under the earth,was able to open the book, neither to look therein.\"</blockquote>\r\n<p>Notice also that this \"strong\" angel is not able to open the book either. (powerful, forceful, boisterious, mighty)</p>\r\n<h3>John's reaction to this fact</h3>\r\n<blockquote>v. 4 \"And I wept much\"</blockquote>\r\n<p>Because of three things -</p>\r\n<h4>None found \"worthy\" to \"open the book\"</h4>\r\n<h4>None found worthy to \"read the book\"</h4>\r\n<h4>None found worthy to \"look thereon\"</h4>\r\n<h2>The Time of the Opening of the Book</h2>\r\n<p>After the Rapture, 4:1</p>\r\n<h2>The Purpose of the Opening of the Book</h2>\r\n<p>To release the judgments of God on the earth</p>"},"type":"READ_HTML_FILE"}
