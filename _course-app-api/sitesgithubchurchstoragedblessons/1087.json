It seems as though the garment of the Body of Christ is stained and her influencing lessening. WHY WOULD THEY WANT IT?\r\n\r\n> ILLUSTRATION: On the Slopes of Long Peak Colorado, a 400 year old tree that withstood 400 passing years of lightening, winds, earthquakes and floods and finally brought down by a bunch of tiny beetles.\r\n\r\n> Isaiah 61:3 **trees of righteousness**\r\n\r\nThe Statue of Liberty in New York's Harbor has stood as a symbol of freedom and hope to immigrants believing in idea that America was a land of opportunity. What America IS is one thing (dirty city streets, struggling economies, corruption and infightings), but what these immigrants were in love with was the IDEA of America which something altogether different.--They caught a vision of what America could be!\r\n\r\nSalvation is more than an idea, it is a real relationship with Christ. But we have to first \"buy in\" in to the idea before we can experience it--FAITH, believe in it, love it, want it. I Love God's People. (hard to fight for something to hard that you don't LOVE.)\r\n\r\n##I. The Idea of Zion (1-5,8-9,12)\r\n\r\n###EXAMPLE: Utopia Seekers\r\n\r\n###Zion is not truly a place on a map, but is first an idea and a hope birthed in the heart of God. Zion is a kingdom where God reigns in majesty and his creation honors and follows him fully as God. Where is blessings are overflowing and his promises are enjoyed. \r\n\r\nSome of the Descriptions\r\n\r\n###A. vs. 1 COMPLETE RESTORATION\r\n> 2 Corinthians 13:9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection. (perfection = restoration)\r\n\r\n> Isaiah 4:5 -- And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.\r\n\r\n> Hebrews 11:10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.\r\n\r\n###B. vs. 2 The Sinner Sinner Sees and Wants What We Have\r\nExperiencing the Truth Makes Men Free\r\n\r\n###C. vs. 3 Where the people of God are to Him a \"CROWN OF GLORY\" and \"A ROYAL DIADEM\". (The headship of Christ.)\r\n\r\n###D. vs. 4,5 Where Our Reproach is Turned Away\r\nForsaken, Desolate = Hephzibah, Beulah (\"My Delight is in her\", \"Married\")\r\n[Description of Newly Weds: You can just tell their happy!]\r\n\r\n###E. vs. 8,9 No More Will Someone ELSE enjoy the fruit of your labor.\r\n\r\n##II. The Work of Zion (6-7,10-11)\r\n**vs. 11 His REWARD is WITH Him, and his WORK BEFORE Him.**\r\nGod has Set Watchmen&hellip;Where? ON THE WALLS: vision, insight, clear view (Not the Mayans, but the Christians!)\r\n\r\n##A. A Work For Us To Do\r\n\r\n> ILLUSTRATION: It means something when someone who has paid the price, says it. I asked Sis. Meadows who is 92 years old, Has God ever failed you? God has never failed me.\r\n\r\nvs. 6 Luke 18:1 Men ought always to pray. -- To the end that the RESTORATION would be hastened.\r\n\r\n###1. (6) - I Will not Change the Message (Watchmen Set, REMEMBRANCERS)\r\n####Say What God is saying and has said!\r\n###2. (7) - I Will not Rest, Until (focused labor, busy for God)\r\n###3. (10) - I Will Gather Out the Stones (double meaning for Antioch)\r\n###4. (11) - vs. 10 Go Through, Go Through - I Will Lift Up a Standard (Lead the way to Christ!)\r\n\r\n##B. A Work in Us (12)\r\n\r\nGod is still preparing a people that will love and follow Him fully. \r\n> Luke 1:17 &hellip;**a people prepared for the Lord**.\r\n\r\n> ILLUSTRATION: Tanzanite is a rare and beautiful gemstone purple and blue in color only found in the Hills near Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. In its rough state it is reddish brown in color and requires heat of 600 degrees Celsius to BRING OUT the blue violet.\r\n\r\n> Isaiah 62:12 -- And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.\r\n\r\n**As times get darker, the genuine people of God will be in high demand for answers and help.**\r\n\r\n##ALTAR CALL:\r\n\r\n###SINNER: Are you attracted to the love and power of Christ?\r\n[Black Diptheria] The Blood of an Overcomer (Louis Pasteur)\r\n\r\n###BELIEVER: Are you inspired by the work to be done BEFORE the Lord?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nUnused Thoughts:\r\n\r\n> Isaiah 61:3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called **trees of righteousness**, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON, Who lead America in the Revolutionary War and then served as her first President, old and tired retired from public service to his home in Mt. Vernon. Years had gone by and congress still hadn't released the funds for giving backpay to the Revolutionary War veterans. Years of complaints and protest hadn't convinced Congress that it was vital these soldiers be paid. George Washington gave of his own money to the soldiers and then came out of the quiet of his seclusion and traveled to compel congress to pay its soldiers. He stood before Congress beginning to speak \"Forgive me as I put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but have gone blind in the service of my country.\"; There was not a single argument made in Congress that day against President Washington.\r\n\r\n-->"},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
