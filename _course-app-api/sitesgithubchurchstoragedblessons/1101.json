(The lepers Jesus cured in Mk 1:40-45 and Lk 11:17-19 were not named.)\r\n\r\n- The term “leprosy” (including leper, lepers, leprosy, leprous) occurs 68 times in the Bible\r\n- Many have thought leprosy to be a disease of the skin. It is better classified, however, as a disease of the nervous system because the leprosy bacterium attacks the nerves. \r\n-   The leprosy bacillus destroys nerve endings that carry pain signals. The largest number of deformities develop from loss of pain sensation. For instance, inattentive patients can pick up a cup of boiling water without flinching. The lack of pain receptors could not warn them of the danger.\r\n-  Leprosy is spread by multiple skin contacts, as well as by droplets such as nasal secretions that are transmitted from person to person.\r\n-  Societally: Leprosy was Feared as the judgment of God, so a Leper was treated as an OUTCAST\r\n\r\n## Naaman's Recovery, vs. 2-14\r\n\r\n### A Little Maid with a Word of Recovery!, vs. 2-4\r\n\r\n> 2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. 3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would **recover him of his leprosy**. 4 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel. \r\n\r\n- UNLIKE ALL THE OTHERS whose best approach was IGNORE IT, ACCEPT IT ... \r\n\r\n- AS repulsive as the leprosy is, there is a diamond in there worth it and able to be RECOVERED.\r\n\r\n- Jesus Freely Touched People with Leprosy. \r\n\r\n> Mt 26:6 ¶ Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,\r\n\r\n<!- -->\r\n\r\n> Mark 1:40-42 &mdash; And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. 42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.\r\n\r\n<!- -->\r\n\r\n> Matthew 8:1-3&mdash; When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. 2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 3 And **Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him**, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.\r\n\r\n### Recovery My Way, vs. 5-\r\n\r\n> 5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. 6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy. 7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.  8 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. 9 ¶ So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. 10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean. 11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper. 12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. \r\n\r\n### Recovery God's Way, vs. 13-14\r\n \r\n> 13 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? 14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.\r\n\r\n- Humility\r\n- Brokenness\r\n- Faith & Obedience"},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
