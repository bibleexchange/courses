Luke 14:11-35\r\n\r\nIn hearing the teaching of the important doctrine of the GRACE of God and how His grace works, there is a trap of the enemy laid out to trip up the unsurrendered life. The trap goes something like this, \"God has done it all already\" and \"All I have to do is believe\" and \"Reject any message of works (obedience of faith) as it smells of legalism.\"\r\n\r\n### The Message\r\n\r\nDoing the Word of God, is the occupation of a surrendered life.\r\n\r\n- **Luke 1** - [John the Baptist] 17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\r\n- **Luke 2** - 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; 35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. [Heb. 12 -- endured the contradiction of sinners.]\r\n- **Luke 3** - v.7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, \r\n- **Luke 4** - [led of the Spirit into the wilderness fasted] - man shall not live by bread alone, but by EVERY WORD OF GOD. - Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\r\n- **Luke 5** - Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 31 ...They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\r\n- **Luke 6** - wise man and foolish man. \"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?\" (v. 20-38 Blessed are ... woe to ... give ... love ... be merciful)\r\n- **Luke 7** - 31 ... what are they like? 32 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.\r\n- **Luke 8** - Good Seed and Good Ground\r\n- **Luke 9** - v.56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. \r\n- **Luke 10** - v.25 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? && v. 29 Who is my neighbor?\r\n- **Luke 11** - v. 52 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.\r\n- **Luke 12** - v. 19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\r\n- **Luke 13** - Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\r\n- **Luke 14** -  A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:\r\n- **Luke 15** -  A certain man had two sons:\r\n- **Luke 16** - the rich man also died, and was buried;\r\n- **Luke 17** - v. 33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.\r\n- **Luke 18** - And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\r\n- **Luke 19** - 8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. 9 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, && A certain nobleman went into a far country...occupy till I come\r\n- **Luke 20** - [rejected Christ] \"18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\"\r\n- **Luke 21 ** [end of time] 34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.\r\n- **Luke 22** - \"31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, SATAN HATH DESIRED TO HAVE YOU, that he may sift you as wheat: 32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\"\r\n- **Luke 23** - \"have found no fault in this man\" give us barrabas .... &&  And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.\r\n- **Luke 24** - \"He is risen indeed\" ... 47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n### The Call\r\n\r\n> Luke 14:11-14 &mdash; For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. 12 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. 13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 14 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.\r\n\r\n> Luke 14:15-27 &mdash; 15 And when one of them that SAT AT MEAT WITH HIM him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall EAT BREAD IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD. 16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: 17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. 18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. 19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.\r\n20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. 21 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. 22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. 23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, THAT MY HOUSE MAY BE FILLED. 24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. 25 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, 26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. 27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.\r\n\r\nLuke 14:34,35 &mdash; Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? 35 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out.

This valley afterwards became the common receptacle for all the trash of the city. Here the dead bodies of animals and of criminals, and all kinds of filth, were cast and consumed by fire kept always burning. It thus in process of time became the image of the place of everlasting destruction.\r\n\r\nDestroyed in the sense of ruined for any useful purpose and not \"ANNILIHILATED\"\r\n\r\n### 4. The Truth\r\n\r\n- We cannot receive the revelation of Heaven without accepting the revelation of Hell. It is the same Bible that teaches us both.\r\n\r\n- treasurest up unto thyself wrath ...
