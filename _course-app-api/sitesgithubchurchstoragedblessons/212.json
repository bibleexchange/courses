While we are intimidated by the voices of &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be so strict. It&apos;s just innocent fun.&rsquo; millions of souls are being influenced and destroyed. We must be watchful and try the spirits according to the Word of God. Let us look at three examples of such influences. These three influences are widely promulgated as harmless&#44; non-spiritual&#44; or non-moral issues. On the contrary&#44; there are powerful spiritual influences at work behind these and many&#44; many more issues. This list is not at all extensive&#44; but contains only a few examples taken out of a multitude of possibilities.</p><h2>Virtual Reality</h2><p>People live in a make believe world. They become so attached with the imagined and concocted that they become completely detached from reality. The multitude of ideas involved with escaping reality into a &lsquo;virtual reality&rsquo; involve role playing games&#44; to video games&#44; and the use of drugs and alcohol.</p><p>The late dangerous Timothy Francis Leary is an example of who we all need to stand strong against. President Richard Nixon once called him &lsquo;the most dangerous man in America.&rsquo;n of 1960s counterculture&#44; Leary is most famous as a proponent of the therapeutic&#44; spiritual and emotional benefits of LSD. He coined and popularized the catch phrase \"Turn on&#44; tune in&#44; drop out.\" Leary was a corrosive influence on society and his ideas continue to infect our world.</p><p>&lsquo;During the 1980s and 90s the charismatic Leary styled himself as a postmodern guru&#44; and celebrated computer technology as a utopian&#44; boundary-demolishing force. He took leave of life in the style in which he had lived it&#44; detailing his illness and drug-taking on a website. In 1997 a Spanish satellite carried some of his ashes into space.&rsquo;</p><p>FROM FOOTNOTES:&lsquo;Timothy Francis Leary&rsquo;&#44; The Columbia Encyclopedia&#44; Sixth Edition Â©2008 Columbia University Press</p><p>Virtual Reality may seem harmless to some but the effects are startling&#44; It can be used to take the place of the real person and result in the individual doing things they wouldn&rsquo;t normally do. Virtual Reality&apos;s development is heightened by the fact that many are instantly willing to believe that it is in contrast and unimposing on genuine reality. There are undoubtedly many dangerous possibilities that result from such experimentation and philosophies. <strong>It does have real life consequences.</strong></p><p>The Word of God warned us of these things</p><blockquote>Rev. 13:12&mdash;And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him&#44; and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast&#44; whose deadly wound was healed.</blockquote><h2>Homosexuality</h2><p>Homosexuality is an abomination in the sight of God and the trend of the world has been to soften toward it as time goes along. It is dangerous because of its rebellion against the order of God&#44; it&apos;s direct social impact and its indirect influences. The spirit of homosexuality is repulsive and infectious.</p><blockquote>Galatians 5:19&mdash;Now the works of the flesh are manifest&#44; which are these; Adultery&#44; fornication&#44; uncleanness&#44; lasciviousness&#44;</blockquote><p>Rev.22:14:15 (loving that which is contrary to God and making up lies) John 8:44 Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do</p><p>*It&apos;s not a problem in their genes; it&apos;s an evil perverted spirit in their body. Homosexuality is a choice and an evil decision. No matter what excuses have been made&#44; God will judge this sin of perversion.</p><ul><li>Fire</li><li>Brimstone</li><li>Second death</li></ul><p>2 Corinthians 7:1; I John 1:7&#44; 9; Isaiah 1:18; James 1:14-15</p><p>The right decision for everyone is to be cleansed from every sin.</p><p>God destroyed four cities with fire for Homosexuality. (Gen. 19:1-17; 23-28) Even as Sodom and Gomorrah&#44; and the cities about them in like manner&#44; giving themselves over to fornication&#44; and going after strange flesh&#44; are set forth for an example&#44; suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. (Jude 7)</p><p>I Kings 14:24 There were Sodomites in the land which was an abomination to God.</p><p>II Kings 23:7 Josiah broke down the Sodomites houses.</p><p>Lev. 18:22&mdash;Thou shalt not lie with mankind&#44; as with womankind: it is abomination.</p><h2>Aids: Civil Rights or Civil Wrong?</h2><p>The Judgment of God on promiscuous living has resulted in Aids. Aids was widely spread in its American infancy primarily by homosexual men. We fail to discern over and over the entirety of the consequences of our social blunders and spiritual errors.</p><blockquote>The widely accepted theory is that HIV/AIDS originated in a monkey or chimpanzee virus that \"jumped species\" in Africa. However&#44; it is clear that the first AIDS cases were recorded in gay men in Manhattan in 1979&#44; a few years before the epidemic was first noticed in Africa in 1982. It is now claimed that the human herpes-8 virus (also called the KS virus)&#44; discovered in 1994&#44; also originated when a primate herpes virus jumped species in Africa. How two African species-jumping viruses ended up exclusively in gay men in Manhattan beginning in the late 1970s has never been satisfactorily explained.&rsquo; FROM FOOtNOES: The Gay Experiment That Started AIDS In America By Alan Cantwell&#44; M.D&#44; www.rense.com</blockquote><p>Responsible and principled action must be taken now.</p><p>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a fatal transmissible disease of the immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV slowly attacks and destroys the immune system&#44; the body&apos;s defense against infection&#44; leaving an individual vulnerable to a variety of other infections and certain malignancies that eventually cause death. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection&#44; during which time fatal infections and cancers arise.</p><p>HIV/AIDS spread to epidemic proportions in the 1980s&#44; particularly in Africa. Spread was likely facilitated by several factors&#44; including increasing urbanization and long-distance travel in Africa&#44; international travel&#44; changing sexual morals&#44; and intravenous drug use. By 2002 AIDS had claimed over 25 million lives worldwide. Approximately 40 million people throughout the world are infected with HIV. People living in sub-Saharan Africa account for more than 70 percent of all infections&#44; and in some countries of the region the prevalence of HIV infection of inhabitants exceeds 10 percent of the population. HIV can survive outside of the body for 14 days. Therefore&#44; don&rsquo;t take it lightly or any other sexually transmitted diseases&#44; such as syphilis&#44; herpes&#44; gonorrhea&#44; and chlamydia&#44; which increase the risk of contracting HIV.</p>"},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
