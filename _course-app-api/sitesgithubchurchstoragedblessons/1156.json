But they said, We will not walk therein.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\n- SONG: Jesus on the Inside working on the outside. (16 words)\r\n- THE MARK: To be like Jesus; Christ in every aspect of our lives.\r\n- Holiness is A topic that a lot could be said about without saying much practical ... practical holiness. We are discussing  somethings we **<u>DO</u>**.\r\n- Holiness/Sanctification: set apart from the profane and set apart for Gods use.\r\n- **RELATED WORDS**: Holy, Sacred, Pure, Righteous, Virtuous, Unlike the World, Uncommon, Sanctification practical holiness, godliness.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- Sinner is at best on the outside looking in.\r\n- Saved and An Active Relationship with Jesus.\r\n- Teachable Spirit. Discipleship \"I want to learn\"\r\n- Willingness to be governed\r\n- Prayer and Bible Study\r\n- A Desire to KNOW -- **ASK**\r\n\r\n## Modern Issues - The Confusion (Jeremiah 6:7-20)\r\n\r\n- God has no part in this!\r\n- Neither has God obscured the path. It is increasingly difficult to be a Christian, but its not because God has made it so. NOT GOD'S FAULT.\r\n- Not Everybody who says they are a Christian is saved.\r\n\r\n1. v. 7 **Bullying** (oppression in her)\r\n2. v.10-12 **Contempt for God's Word**\r\n3. v.13 **Worldliness** (covetous, got to have the next best thing)\r\n4. v.14 **Treachery of Prophets** (dressing down, alcohol, tattoos; Psychological Manipulation in \"ministry\")\r\n5. v.15 **No Shame in their Sin**\r\n6. v.18,19 **Won't be Corrected** (man-centered Gospel; Masculinity \"toxic\", merging of the sexes)\r\n7. v.20 **Religious Sacrifice of no use to God** (Mysticism in Music (not \"anointed\"))\r\n\r\n## Biblical Principles that are the Foundation of the Standards of Practical Holiness\r\n\r\n- Where is the Old Path? Where is the good way?\r\n- Absolute, immutable, unchangeable, Timeless, OLD PATH.\r\n\r\n- <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SCIHQ_RstIy-LVeop1Ggv9BJSFOUI6_MHxWpbQBVAh8/edit#> list here\r\n\r\n## Standards\r\n\r\nAs \"Standards of Holiness\" are often a safeguard to Societal Pressures that are always changing, the standards by necessity must be adapted &mdash; without compromise. The Standards must change to better and more practically follow the Biblical principles.\r\n\r\n- Music\r\n- Modest attire - Woman wearing pants, makeup, jewelery; don't give TOO MUCH focus on appearance. BONDAGE.\r\n- Entertainment labeled Christian or \"family friendly\" but they've lost their compass.\r\n- Entertainment - tv - movies - games\r\n- Church involvement, \r\n- Standards of living\r\n- Pertain to Male/female - distinction\r\n- Sexual purity (important to God): Dating, Courting, Marriage\r\n- Sacred Things - life, body, worship/service to God, - some things are sacred - how to handle sacred things? \r\n- No Bywords, Cursing\r\n- No Drugs, Alcohol, tattoos, piercings\r\n- Men look like men and women like women.\r\n- Spiritual Disciplines: Begin each day with prayer and Bible.\r\n- Whatever has the world all excited, we should run away from.\r\n- Don't even LOOK at evil. **LOOK AWAY**\r\n\r\n## ASK\r\n\r\n- What does a Christian look like? Christian identity. A Christian should be distinct and not borrow of the world its attitudes and appetites.\r\n- Woman's hair length?\r\n- Should a Christian attend a movie theatre?\r\n- How to live in a pleasing way to God? And walk in a deeper way. \r\n- What are the Essentials to drawing near to God. How to please God. \r\n- Is there a Guide? What are the best practices of living as a Christian?\r\n- ASKING for guidance verse this \"spiritual independence\".\r\n- What is christian music?\r\n\r\n## Verse List\r\n\r\n> Deuteronomy 22:5 &mdash; The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.\r\n\r\n> Psalm 86:11 &mdash; Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.\r\n\r\n> Psalm 96:9 &mdash; O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.\r\n\r\n> Psalm 101:3 &mdash;  I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.\r\n\r\n> Jeremiah 6:16 &mdash; Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.\r\n\r\n> Luke 11:34 &mdash; The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.\r\n\r\n> 1 Timothy 3:14-16 &mdash; These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly: 15 But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. 16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. \r\n\r\n> 1 Peter 1:14-16 &mdash; As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: 15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; 16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.\r\n\r\n> Ephesians 4:21-24 &mdash; If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;  23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.\r\n\r\n> 1 Thessalonians 4:1 &mdash; Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.\r\n\r\n> Titus 2:12 &mdash; Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;\r\n\r\n> 1 Corinthians 1:29 &mdash; That no flesh should glory in his presence.\r\n\r\n> 1 Corinthians 6:19 &mdash; What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\r\n\r\n> 1 John 2:15,16 &mdash; Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\r\n\r\n## Thoughts\r\n\r\n- A daily question we must ask ourselves as we look in he mirror of God's Word.\r\n- Difference: Commands, statutes, principles, spirit of the rule\r\n- Set the Ideal before people. (Platform standards)\r\n- Reframing the question: Is it sin? vs. Is it Holy/Sanctified? (Where is the burden of proof?)\r\n- Ordinances of man must no displace God's commands, but rather ECHO His commands.\r\n- People's lives can be a standard (\"be followers of me ...\" 1 Cor. 11:1)\r\n- https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/preaching-practical-holiness guidelines for how to preach practical holiness.  If a pastor wants to see his people become more holy, more pure, more pleasing to God in their kitchens and bedrooms and offices and backyards, what should he say to them? How should he preach?\r\n- \"out of bounds\" personal convictions. Error of applying necessary personal standards corporately.\r\n- "},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
