Hatcher\r\nOh God, the world is lost in sin,\r\nAnd so few that seem to care,\r\nMany of whom profess Thy Name, No burden will help to bear,\r\nWe need a passion, Lord, for souls,\r\nTo bring the lost back to Thee,\r\nOur hearts must be stirred till all have heard\r\nAt least once of Calvary.\r\nRefrain\r\nLet me burn out for Thee, dear Lord\r\nBurn and wear out for Thee\r\nDon’t let me rust, or my life be a failure, my God, to Thee\r\nUse me and all I have, dear Lord,\r\nAnd hold me so close to Thee\r\nThat I feel the throb of the great heart of God\r\nUntil I burn out for Thee.\r\nHow cold has been our giving, Lord!\r\nHow selfish our love has been,\r\nKeeping from those who never heard\r\nThe gospel that saves from sin!\r\nHow often we have turned aside\r\nNeglecting to do our part,\r\nForgetting Thy tears and agony,\r\nForgetting Thy bleeding heart\r\nRefrain\r\nMeet us and break us up, dear Lord\r\nUntil driven to our knees\r\nBare to our gaze, Thy cross and love,\r\nOf blood-baptized Calvary,\r\nSpeak till we hear again Thy call,\r\nAnd hold nothing back from Thee.\r\nOh, burn on our hears the hopeless wail\r\nOf souls damned eternally.\r\nRefrain\r\nO God, with shame I humbly bow,\r\nIn tears and a contrite heart.\r\nForgive me for the broken vows,\r\nAnd failure to do my part.\r\nI heed Thy call and say “Farewell”\r\nTo all that would hinder me;\r\nThy grace and Thy love to lost ones tell,\r\nAnd my life burn out for Thee"},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
