Also this scene comes after the Rapture of the Church. We read of the rapture in type in Rev. 4:1. The Four Beasts or Four Living Creatures which represent \"the Body of Christ\" or the Church are at the Throne, also.</p>\r\n<h2>The Similarities of the First Four Seals</h2>\r\n<h3>The Opener of the Seals. \"The Lamb\" vs. 1</h3>\r\n<p>In Chapter 5, it was dramatically shown that only the Lamb had the power to take the Book and the power and authority to open the book.</p>\r\n<h3>The Seals Opened</h3>\r\n<h4>John saw something vs. 1.</h4>\r\n<p>John saw something before the thunder. Like a flash of lightening before the storm.</p>\r\n<h4>He heard something.</h4>\r\n<p>He heard - \"As it were the noise of thunder\".</p>\r\n<h3>The Command Given. \"Come\"</h3>\r\n<h4>The Command is Not to John. He is there in the Throne.</h4>\r\n<h4>The Command is A call into Action. A release of Judgment.</h4>\r\n<h4>The Command is Repeated. In regard to the first four seals.</h4>\r\n<h3>The Source of the Command.</h3>\r\n<p>\"One of the Four Beasts\". The Elders are involved with things concerning heavenly subjects (ch. 5 &amp; 7) and The living Creatures are directly involved with things that are Earthly.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:2 -- Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Particulars of the Seven Seals</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Number Seven</h3>\r\n<p>There are Seven Seals in Number. This is indicative of the COMPLETENESS of this administration.</p>\r\n<p>The Seals are arranged in two distinct groups - first there are four and then there are three. A Worldly number that is followed by the heavenly number. These Seven Seals are a Divine judgment on a wicked world</p>\r\n<h3>The First Four Seals are Distinguished by Horses and Horsemen.</h3>\r\n<p>Horses are symbolic pictures of the Power of the Almighty.</p>\r\n<blockquote>2 Kings 6:17 -- And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. [Job 39:19-25; Zech. 1:8-10; Zech. 6:2-5]</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Four Spirits of the heavens from Zechariah 6:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Zechariach 6:1-8 -- And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. 2 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. 4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 5 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 6 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</blockquote>"},"type":"READ_HTML_FILE"}
