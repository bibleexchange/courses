David and Paul said it was because there was no fear of God before their eyes.</h3><blockquote>Psalms 36:1&mdash;[To the chief Musician&#44; A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD.] The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart&#44; that there is no fear of God before his eyes.</blockquote><blockquote>Romans 3:18&mdash;There is no fear of God before their eyes.</blockquote><blockquote>2 Peter 3:5&mdash;For this they willingly are ignorant of&#44; that by the word of God.</blockquote><blockquote>John 3:19-20&mdash;&hellip;because their deeds were evil.</blockquote><blockquote>Hebrews 6:4-6&mdash;For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened &hellip;6 If they shall fall away&#44; to renew them again unto repentance&hellip;</blockquote><blockquote>Acts 13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold&#44; and said&#44; It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you&#44; and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life&#44; lo&#44; we turn to the Gentiles.</blockquote><h3>Many reject and hate truth because of unbelief.</h3><blockquote>2 Thessalonians 2:1-12&mdash;Now we beseech you&#44; brethren&hellip; be not soon shaken in mind&#44; or be troubled&#44; neither by spirit&#44; nor by word&#44; nor by letter as from us&#44; as that the day of Christ is at hand. 3) Let no man deceive you by any means&hellip;12) That they all might be damned who believed not the truth&#44; but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</blockquote><blockquote>1 Tim 4:1-2&mdash;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly&#44; that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith&#44; giving heed to seducing spirits&#44; and doctrines of devils; 2) Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; </blockquote><h2>They have a love for darkness.</h2><blockquote>John 1:11&mdash;He came unto his own&#44; and his own received him not.</blockquote><blockquote>John 3:19-21&mdash;And this is the condemnation&#44; that light is come into the world&#44; and men loved darkness rather than light&#44; because their deeds were evil&hellip;20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light&#44; neither cometh to the light&#44; lest his deeds should be reproved.</blockquote><blockquote>Col. 1:13&mdash;Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness&#44; and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: </blockquote><blockquote>Rev. 16:10&mdash;&hellip;his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain&#44;</blockquote><h2>They are spiritually immature.</h2><blockquote>Hebrews 5:11-14&mdash;For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
