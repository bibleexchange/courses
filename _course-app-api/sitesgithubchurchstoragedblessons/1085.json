But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. 58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.\r\n\r\n\r\n## INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nNothing we do can change God. But God chooses to deal with us according to our own choices. He shows great mercy to the bound and oppressed, but requires much to whom He has shown His mercy.\r\n\r\n> Luke 12:48 &hellip; For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required:&hellip;\r\n- For the wicked, God waits for their cup of iniquity to become FULL.\r\n- For the Believer, God waits for us to apply His promises.\r\n\r\n## I. Knowing only the Doctrine and not the experiences of God.\r\n\r\n> John 8:32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\r\n\r\n> Acts 19:1 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, 2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. 3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. 4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. 5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.\r\n\r\n## II. Through unbelief and small expectations of God\r\n\r\n> Mt 8:26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.\r\n\r\n> WORRY-- Fewer than one \"problem\" in every ten that we worry about is a legitimate concern.\r\n\r\n> 2Ki 13:14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. 15 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows. 16 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands. 17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them. 18 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed. 19 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.\r\n\r\nFaith is the Green Light for God to work.\r\n\r\n> Mt 19:26 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Mr 9:23 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.â€ƒ\r\n\r\n## III. Sin\r\n\r\n### Unclean Vessels &mdash; \r\n\r\n- Achan&apos;s Disobedience, \t\r\n- Cain&apos;s Envy and Murder\r\n- Samson&apos;s Wandering Eyes \r\n\r\n> 1Co 1:29 That no flesh should glory in his presence.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> 2 Co 6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? 15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, 18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Ps 84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.\r\n\r\nGod has SET qualifications for service: \r\n\r\n> 1Ti 3:1 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. 2 A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; 3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; 4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 5 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) 6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. 7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.\r\n\r\n## IV. How we Treat Each Other\r\n\r\n> 1Pe 3:7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> 1Jo 4:20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?\r\n\r\n## V. Not Allowing God to be God in Our Life \r\n\r\n### No time for a miracle &mdash; the supernatural, too well and thoroughly planned\r\n\r\n#### Take no script or purse, don&apos;t think what to say before\r\n\r\n> 2 Tim 2:25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;\r\n\r\n### &quot;If God will&quot;\r\n\r\n> James 4:13 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: 14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. 15 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.\r\n\r\n### When did I last &quot;Wait&quot; on God\r\n\r\nThe 3 Hebrew Children, OUR GOD IS ABLE, but Even He doth not deliver&hellip;\r\n\r\n> Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? Isaiah 43:13\r\n\r\nThe true sense is we limit ourselves from receiving good from God."},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
