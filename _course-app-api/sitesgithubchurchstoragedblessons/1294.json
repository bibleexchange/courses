Although accounts of &quot;Creation&quot;&#44; &quot;The Flood&quot;&#44;and the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; can be found throughout the ancient civilizations&#44; itis the only trustworthy and mature record concerning the beginnings of theuniverse&#44; humankind&#44; marriage&#44; sin&#44; cities&#44; languages&#44; nations&#44; Israel&#44; and thepurpose of God in all of these things.\r\n\r\n### The Title of This Book \r\n\r\nThe title of this book given to it in the Greek Septuagint means &quot;creation&quot; or &quot;generation&quot;and the Jews refer to Genesis as &quot;Bereshith&quot; meaning &quot;in the beginning.&quot;\r\n\r\n### Genesis is a Book Origins\r\n\r\nIt was the first book of the Bible written (with the possible exception of Job).\r\n\r\nThe history of Genesis reveals that the material universe is distinctly God&apos;s work and not some independent process. (Fifty times in chapters one and two are found verbs expressing what God did--God made&#44; saw&#44; said&#44; formed) \r\n\r\nGenesis is the book of firsts: recording the first marriage&#44; first family&#44; first birth&#44;first sin&#44; first murder&#44; first polygamist&#44; first musical instruments&#44; and the first promise of redemption. The covenant made to Abraham in 12:1-3 is central to all Scripture.\r\n\r\nGenesis alone explains the origin of the twelve tribes of Israel. Genesis reveals how the descendants of Abraham ended up in Egypt for 430 years and so sets the stage for the Exodus&#44; the central redemption event of the Old Testament. \r\n\r\n## Prophecy\r\n\r\nGenesis reveals the prophetic history of redemption and a Redeemer as coming through the seed of the woman (3:15)&#44; the line of Seth (4:25&#44;26)&#44; the line of Shem(9:26&#44;27)&#44; and through the seed of Abraham (12:3.) The New Testament applies Genesis12:3 directly to God&apos;s provision of redemption in Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:16&#44;29.) \r\n\r\n\r\n# Activities\r\n\r\n### Who&apos;s Who \r\n\r\n```\r\nAbel, Abraham, Adam, Benjamin, Cain, Eliezer, Enoch, Ephraim, Esau, Eve, Hagar, Ham, Isaac, Ishmel, Jacob, Japheth, Joseph, Judah, Laban, Leah, Lot, Manasseh, Melchizedek, Methuselah, Nimrod, Noah, Pharaoh, Potiphar, Rachel, Rebekah, Reuben, Sarah, Seth, Shem, Terah\r\n```\r\n1.  __________________ The first Woman - Mother of All Living\r\n\r\n2.  __________________ First person to die\r\n3.  __________________The first murderer\r\n4.  _________________ Adam&apos;s Third Son\r\n5.  _________________ a mighty hunter; leader of rebellion at Babel\r\n6.  __________________ never died - walked with God\r\n7.  __________________ Oldest man that ever lived&#44; died before his father\r\n8. __________________name means rest; comfort; consolation\r\n9. __________________ and __________________ and __________________ 3 Sons of Noah\r\n10. _________________The first Hebrew\r\n11. __________________ Abraham&apos;sfather\r\n12. __________________ Abraham&apos;s nephew who lived in Sodom \r\n13. _________________ Beautiful wife of Abraham\r\n14. __________________ Sarah&apos;s handmaid\r\n15. __________________ Priest of God to whom Abraham Paid tithes\r\n16. __________________ Abraham and Sarah&apos;s child of Promise\r\n17. __________________ Abraham and Hagar&apos;s son\r\n18. _________________ Abraham&apos;s servant who went for Isaac&apos;s Bride\r\n19. _________________ Isaac&apos;sWife\r\n20. __________________ names means of the ground; red earth. - Despised His Birthright\r\n21. __________________ name means supplanter(to overthrow by tripping up; to replace by treachery)\r\n22. _________________ Laban&apos;s Eldest Daughter&#44; Jacob&apos;s first wife\r\n23. __________________  Jacob&apos;s favorite wife\r\n24. __________________ Jacob&apos;s oldest son\r\n25. __________________ Jacob&apos;s youngest son\r\n26. _________________  Jacob&apos;sson through whom the Redeemer would come\r\n27. _________________ Jacob&apos;sUncle&#44; Brother of Rebecca\r\n28. _________________ Saved Israel from Famine\r\n29. __________________ Ruler of Egypt \r\n30. __________________ Captain of the Guard in Egypt&#44; Bought Joseph\r\n31. __________________ and _____________________  Joseph's 2 Sons"},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
