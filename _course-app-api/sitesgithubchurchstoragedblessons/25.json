Reynolds, Jr.\r\nActs\r\nOctober 21, 2004\r\n“Memory Verses &    l \r\nChapter Summaries”\r\n\r\n1.\tI memorized and quoted verbatim Acts 1:8 to Rev. Stephen Reynolds, Sr.\r\n\r\n2.\tI memorized and quoted verbatim I John 4:4 to Rev. Stephen Reynolds, Sr.\r\n\r\n3.\tRead Acts chapters 1 and 2 and give a summary of each.\r\nACTS 1\r\nV. 1 The author (Luke the physician) addresses a man named “Theophilus”.\r\n\ttreatise – Greek- 3056 (Strong’s)—logos – “something said; word”\r\n\r\nV.2 Jesus through the Holy Ghost gave commandments unto the apostles. Combining this principle with the one in John 16:13-16, all 3 Persons of the Godhead are clearly seen working in unity. The Holy Ghost is not the Post-Pentecost manifestation of Jesus, but is the Third Person of the Eternal Godhead. All Three Persons are equally existent with None preceding or following another. Verse two of chapter one is obviously physically and chronologically before verse one of chapter two.\r\n\r\nVv. 3-5 The command to remain in Jerusalem unto the Holy Ghost came is recorded.\r\n\r\nVv. 6-8 The effect and purpose of the giving of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nVv. 9-11 Christ taken up into a cloud is recorded.\r\n \r\nVv. 12-26 120 disciples wait in the upper room for the “Promise of the Father.” Peter declares that the prophet of God foretold Judas’ treason and he moves that a replacement be chosen. Mathias is chosen.\r\n\r\nACTS 2\r\nVv. 1-4 The Holy Ghost filled all in the upper room.\r\n\r\nVv. 5-13 The infilling of the Holy Ghost was initially evidenced by the speaking in other tongues. Many were amazed and marveled; some mocked.\r\n\r\nVv. 14-36 Peter Preaches\t-- “God Hath Made Jesus both Lord and Christ” Christ—Greek—5547 (Strong’s)—“anointed”\r\n\tMessiah—Hebrew—4899 (Strong’s)—“anointed”\r\n\tPeter declares Jesus of Nazareth to be the Messiah. Peter declares that God approved Jesus by signs, wonders, resurrection, and by the fulfillment of Messianic prophecy (i.e. Christ’s place in the family line of the patriarch David). Peter even clarifies that the prophecies of David spoke not of himself, but of the Messiah, the Christ—Jesus of Nazareth. All occurred and was done by Divine order. Jesus now sits at the right hand of the Father.\r\n\r\nVv. 37-47 Results of the Day of Pentecost:\r\n•\t3,000 saved in one day\r\n•\tSigns and wonders performed through the apostles\r\n•\tGladness in the Believers\r\n•\tUnity amongst the Believers\r\n•\tGlory given to God\r\n•\tSouls were added to the church DAILY\r\n"},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
