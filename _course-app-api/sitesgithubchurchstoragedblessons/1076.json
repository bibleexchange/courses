And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. 4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him. 5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.\r\n\r\n--THEME: Let Him Be God (accountability, submission)\r\n\r\n>1 Kings 18:24&mdash;And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, **let him be God**. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.\r\n\r\n##The Kingdom\r\n\r\n--The Kingdom of My Heart--\r\n>Proverbs 12:7&mdash;The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.\r\n\r\n##Who are the Powers?\r\n\r\n1. Self\t\t\t- 1 Corinthians 13:4 Vaunteth not itself&hellip;self promotion\r\n2. The World\t- 2 Timothy 4:10 -- Having loved this present world\r\n3. Satan\t\t- Luke 22:31 he may sift you as wheat:\r\n3. God\t\t\t- Jeremiah 23:1 Woe to those scatter&hellip;sheep of **my pasture**!\r\n\r\n##What is the \"Balance of Power\"\r\n\r\n>dictionary: \"balance of power\" a distribution and opposition of forces among nations such that no single nation is strong enough to assert its will or dominate all the others.\r\n\r\nAs illustrated in our text, there can never be a BALANCE of these powers! Let God be God!\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES:\r\n\r\n- Jonah ran but God had his way!\r\n- \r\n\r\n##Surrender to the Winning Side and Win!\r\n\r\n Lu 16:13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\r\n\r\nLet God be God. Obviously and intentionally \"Christian\".--Christ follower\r\n\r\nThe surrendered life to Christ is a life completely sold out to **will of God**.\r\n\r\n##A Plan for Surrender\r\n\r\nThe Surrendered Life Isn't easy.\r\n\r\n>Samuel Kamaleson illustrates [the difficulty of submission] through a Christian folk story from South India. It opens with a young boy who loved to play marbles. He regularly walked through his neighborhood with a pocketful of his best marbles, hoping to find opponents to play against. One marble in particular, his special blue marble, had won him many matches. During one walk he encountered a young girl who was eating a bag of chocolate candy. Though the boy's first love was marbles, he had a weakness for chocolates. As he stood there interacting with the young girl, his salivary glands and the rumbling in his stomach became uncontrollable, and he thought to himself, I have got to get my hands on those chocolates. Concocting a plan, he asked the girl, \"How about I give you all these marbles for those chocolates?\" She replied, \"Sounds fair to me.\" He put his hand in his pocket, searching for the distinguishing cracks on the surface of the blue marble. Once he identified the blue marble with his finger tip, he carefully pushed it to the bottom of his pocket and pulled out all the other marbles. As he handed the marbles to the girl in exchange for the chocolate, the boy thought his plan was a success and turned to walk away. As he began to eat the candy, he suddenly turned to the girl and asked, \"Hey, did you give me all the chocolates?\"\r\n\r\nIt isn't even possible as long as self is king. What I want.\r\n\r\n###Deny Self Daily\r\nPrepare to die daily! (Not, \"I've made my sacrifice\".)\r\n\r\n> 1 Corinthians 15:31 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.\r\n\r\n<!---->\r\n\r\n>John 11:14 said plainly, Lazarus is dead\r\n\r\n\"But he is dead!\" Stop breathing life into him! Find ways to die!\r\n\r\n\"Continually exposed to death\" ACC -- Keep your feet to the fire.\r\n\r\n>Mr 14:41 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 42 **Rise up, let us go**; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.\r\n\r\n###Remain Accountable to the Body of Christ\r\n\r\n>Heb 3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened **through the deceitfulness of sin**.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't see it coming.\" That is why it is called a DECEPTION. Safeguard your soul through MEEKNESS.\r\n\r\n>1Co 16:16 &hellip;submit yourselves unto &hellip; every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.\r\n<!---->\r\n>Eph 5:21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.\r\n<!---->\r\n>Eph 5:22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.\r\n<!---->\r\n>Heb 13:17 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:&hellip;\r\n<!---->\r\n> Jas 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\r\n<!---->\r\n> 1Pe 2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;\r\n<!---->\r\n> 1Pe 5:5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.\r\n<!---->\r\n> Jas 5:16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.\r\n\r\n##CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIt is a self deception that we can balance the powers and remain free. We can only be free by surrendering to the winning side.\r\n\r\n- Will my self life conquer all?\r\n- Will the world conquer all?\r\n- Will the devil conquer all?\r\n- Will Christ conquer all?\r\n\r\nVictory by submission&mdash;SURRENDER. LOSE to WIN!"},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
