Simeon and Anna.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What= Let Us Go Unto Him!, 13-16 (How to Worship or what worship looks like)\r\n\r\n> 13  Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 14  For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. 15  By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. 16  But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.\r\n\r\nCome Bless the Lord!\r\n\r\n- It Needs to be Guarded (Genesis 15:11) Drive Off the Fowl)\r\n- Bearing His Reproach (cannot care what is going on around you) -- tendancy to watch instead of worship--\r\n> Fire On the Altar (The Holy Ghost) -- Elijah, Gideon\r\n\r\n## WHO= Unto Him (Who to Worship)\r\n\r\n> 13  Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.\r\n\r\n- not the preacher\r\n- not the music\r\n- think about Jesus\r\n\r\n## CONCLUSION: \r\n\r\n1.
