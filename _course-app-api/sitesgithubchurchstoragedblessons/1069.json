God's Need for Man\r\n\r\nWhy would an eternal God need anybody?\r\n\r\n> Matthew 5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and **glorify your Father** which is in heaven.\r\n\r\nGod's need is born not out of a shortcoming in the Divine God, but out of His LOVE for His creation. \r\n\r\n### God willingly yokes up with the repentant.\r\n\r\n> Mt 11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\r\n\r\n### He Has Born Our Need\r\n\r\n> John 4:4 And he must needs go through Samaria.\r\n\r\n### The Donkey\r\n\r\n> Matthew 21:3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.\r\n\r\n### Daily Prepare to be Useful to God\r\n\r\n> Isa 43:10 **Ye are my witnesses**, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.\r\n\r\nillustrations in Scripture:\r\n\r\n1.
