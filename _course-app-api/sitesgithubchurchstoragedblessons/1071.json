For I was the king's cupbearer.\r\n\r\nWe often DESIRE what is harmful to us. It doesn't have to make sense, to be a very REAL feeling--I WANT IT! Desire turns to ADDICTION and satisfaction is fleeting. (Overcome with Desire)\r\n\r\n> Pr 1:22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.\r\n\r\nAM I BROKEN? Well, yes, but there is cure!!! Fix it for me preacher.\r\n\r\n## Where Does Desire Come From?\r\n\r\n**Desire is a symptom of the heart condition.** As a desire for water is a sympton of a thirsty body, so desires of a moral nature are symptons of the condition of the heart. \r\n\r\nOur desires are revealing of the condition of our heart. Cravings are symptons of deficiencies and conditions. How deep does the Lord's influence run in my life? \r\n\r\nMy heart is conditioned to desire, to long, to want. \r\n\r\nThe devil can wave it in front of me, but if I don't WANT it, he is wasting his time!\r\n\r\nWhat am I allowing to CONDITION me to desire? (Advertising, Messaging, \"ILLUST. of logo design and messaging\")\r\n\r\n> Genesis 13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and **pitched his tent toward Sodom**.\r\n\r\nGod made us with our senses and desires. Sin perverts them and the influence of Christ redeems and restores them.\r\n\r\n> Ps 139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you could just take that tenacity you use to serve the devil and turn it toward serving God, you would be unstoppable.\r\n\r\n## How to Defeat an Evil Desire?\r\n\r\n> Pr 23:6 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:\r\n\r\nIf Desire is a sympton, don't band-aid, hide, cover up the sympton. It's a red flag something is wrong of great impact. **Seek Deliverance -- Go After It!!!**\r\n\r\n### Desires snowball -- \r\n\r\n> John 4:13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into\r\n\r\n### Instead of your heart, let God's Word GUIDE us:\r\n\r\n> 2 Timothy 2:22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.\r\n\r\n### Nail it to the cross. Confront your heart with the sacrifice of Christ's innocence.\r\n\r\n### Every craving begins with a cue. (a trigger, a smell, a sight, a sensation, a memory) \r\n\r\n- Limit satan's access to your heart. \r\n- Limit your flesh's access to its lusts (get out of town, cut it off)\r\n\r\n## Pure Desires\r\n\r\nThe best defense is a good offense. Substitute negative desires with that which is wholesome. Find the ALTERNATIVE.\r\n\r\n### DESIRING what is right, begins with DENYING yourself.\r\n\r\n> Mt 16:24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\r\n\r\n### The School of Christ\r\n\r\n> Php 4:11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.\r\n\r\n### Put God's Provision to Work in Your Life!\r\n\r\n> Ps 34:8 **O taste and see** that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.\r\n<!-- -->\r\n> Ps 10:17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: **thou wilt prepare their heart**, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:"},"type":"READ_MD_FILE"}
