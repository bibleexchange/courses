In response to the breaking of the seal there is silence. This silence appears to be a &quot;calm before the storm&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This silence takes place &quot;In Heaven&quot; and lasts for half an hour (&quot;Hemioron&quot; &quot;Hemi&quot;: Half plus &quot;Hora&quot;: Hour).</P>\r\n\r\n<h2>Meaning of the Silence</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This seal and the resulting silence are quite mysterious. We can consider the definitions of the words used, but any other suggestings to their meaning is speculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Revelation 8:1, \"Silence\" (siqe) means hush, voluntary stillness or refusal to speak. It is a silence of intense interest and awful expectancy with reference to the results of the breaking of the seventh seal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the following section of Revelation makes several strong allusions to the different parts of temple worship. For example:</p>\r\n\t<ul class='bullets'>\r\n\t\t<li>Altar and incense in 8:3.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Four horns of the altar in 9:13.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Temple of God in 11:1.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n<p>Adam Clarke makes a comparison of this silence and the prayerful silence of the people who waited while the priest went in to burn incense in the holy place.\r\n </p>\r\n \r\n <blockquote>Luke 1:10 -- And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</blockquote>"},"type":"READ_HTML_FILE"}
