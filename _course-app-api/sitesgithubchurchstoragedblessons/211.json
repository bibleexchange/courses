The occult deals with operations or events which seem to depend upon human powers to go far beyond the five senses. The occult deals with the supernatural&#44; the presence of demonic forces&#44; and even the paranormal.</p><h3>Danger of the Occult</h3><p>It is dangerous to deny its existence or to be ignorant of its devices. An equal error is to have an unhealthy interest in the occult. (II Cor. 2:11; Rom. 16:9; I Tim. 4:1)A Major Warning. Playing around with the occult will lead to serious mental and spiritual problems. Be Aware of the ongoing spiritual battle between the Kingdom of God and the kingdom of satan. We need to be aware of the workings of the satanic realm but not to the point of unhealthy fascination&#44; obsession or any kind of involvement. God judges and condemns all traffic with demons.
