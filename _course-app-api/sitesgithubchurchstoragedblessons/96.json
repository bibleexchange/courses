They are described to him by the glorious Angel, who is the Lord Jesus Himself. The account that is given here is not John's but Christ's, given in His own words.</p>\r\n<p>Who, then, are these Two Witnesses?The connection in which the account is given may help to give us the answer. These Witnesses come upon us suddenly, in the midst of the scenes of the Judgment, and at a time when Christ is ready to take possession of the earth.</p>\r\n<h2>Their Outstanding Circumstances -</h2>\r\n<h3>Ordained of God - vs.3</h3>\r\n<p>\"My two witnesses\" - \"And I will give power\"</p>\r\n<h4>Power to Prophesy -vs 3</h4>\r\n<h4>Power to Punish -vs. 5</h4>\r\n<h4>Power to Shut Heaven -vs. 6a</h4>\r\n<h4>Power to Work Miracles -vs. 6b,c</h4>\r\n<h3>Two in Number -vs. 3- 4</h3>\r\n<p>Deut. 17:6; Matt. 18:16; Moses and Aaron -Caleb and Joshua\r\nZerubbabel and Jeshua -Peter and John\r\nOld Testament and New Testament\r\nEverything to be established by two or three witnesses.\r\nNotice- vs. 4; Zech. 4:1-3.

Some believe Moses and Elijah. Some believe Enoch and Elijah. Some believe O.T. and N.T. Some believe a body of believers. Malachi 3:1-6; 4:1,5-6; Matt. 17:10-13; 11:14-15; Luke 1:15-17. John the baptist was a partial fulfillment - Mal. 4:6; Luke 1:17. Lev. 26:1,9; Jer. 14:22; Zech. 10:1,2; Hag. 1:9-11.\r\nThe Reason water to blood - Because of the bloody and oppressive tyranny. Moses in Egypt. The bloody persecution.</p>\r\n<h3>They Are Merciful Witnesses.</h3>\r\n<p>Though they appear in judgment, the message is a warning -\r\n\"To flee from the wrath to come\" - But they will hot listen - II Thess. 2:9-11.</p>\r\n<p>What have we identified the two witnesses to be?

We are not to avenge ourselves.Not to smite and kill our enemies - but love them. Jesus was crucified Stephen was stoned. James was beheaded. Peter was crucified.Paul beaten -imprisoned - beheaded - Polycarp is burned.The Gospel is a thing of joy. Isa. 57:7.</p>\r\n<h4>Their garments symbols of calamity and judgment. The heavens are shut - no rain -no grain. Waters are turned to blood.</h4>\r\n<h3>They are very Evil Times.</h3>\r\n<h4>Times of great affliction and sorrow for God's true ministers. Hell has incarnated itself upon earth.</h4>\r\n<h4>From the Abyss has come the Beast. All the world wonder at -</h4>\r\n<p>All worship and adore him - Not given to the worship of God.</p>\r\n<h4>War rages against God's People. Rev. 12:13 They are overcome.</h4>\r\n<p>The two witnesses are killed. How many more?</p>\r\n<h4>They are times of Miracles, vs.3 The Two witnesses</h4>\r\n<p>The Beast and False Prophet - lying signs and wonders.

Rev. 20:4a.</p>\r\n<h3>The Place of Death - vs. 8 \"in the street&hellip;of the great city\"</h3>\r\n<p>They are denied burial. \"Spiritually called Sodom and Egypt\" This is further proof of the literalness of this prophesy. Jerusalem in Apostasy, is a Sodom. Isa. 1:9-10; 3:8-9; Deut. 32:30-33; Jer. 23:14.</p>\r\n<h3>The Length of Their Death - vs. 1 3 -1/2 days.</h3>\r\n<p>They do not remain dead. \"Life came into ,them -and stood upon their feet.\" The world is left in shock -</p>\r\n<h3>They Ascend into Heaven - vs. 12.</h3>\r\n<p>They hear the call.
