Apart from God, the word 'HOLY' has no meaning. [There is no LOVE, LOVE, LOVE but there is HOLY HOLY HOLY]\r\n\r\n> Isaiah 6:3 &mdash; And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. [seraphim -- fiery creatures, HOLINESS & FIRE]\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> Isaiah 61:8 For I the Lord love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.\r\n\r\n- God is to be Desired (There is a Groom) &amp; He has DECKED Himself with ORNAMENTS\r\n\r\n- Why do we worship so? Worship is our response to God's Holiness (God's glory is the impact of His holiness on a person. CLOUD, FIRE, SHAKING, AWESOMENESS)\r\n\r\nIf there is no vision of the HOLINESS of God, there can be no true worship.\r\n\r\n> Psalm 29:2 &mdash; Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.\r\n\r\n===========================\r\n## A Vision for the Holiness of God's People (There is a Bride)\r\n\r\n### The Groom WILL Have His Bride (ENGAGEMENT)\r\n\r\n#### The Bible Relates People and God in many different Ways\r\n\r\n- Creator and Creature\r\n- Savior (Deliverer) and Sinner/Saints/Captive\r\n- Friend\r\n- Father and Children\r\n- Great High Priest and Priests\r\n\r\n#### There is no more important Relationship mentioned than God as THE BRIDEGROOM and His people as THE BRIDE\r\n\r\nHe has saved us for a PURPOSE. Restoring an unbroken fellowship. (62:1) FOR ZION's SAKE: His Desire is for HER!\r\n\r\nHe is Righteous & He makes her righteous!\r\n\r\n- The Wedding is the DEFINITIVE (often cliche) Happy Ending\r\n\r\n### The Bride Eliminates All Other Competition for Her Heart\r\n\r\n- The Bride Sees the Groom as FAR Superior to any other Competitor for her Affection\r\n- She sees him as unlike another and so the field is cleared\r\n- She Eliminates the possibility that there is some competition: HE IS MINE, I AM HIS. \r\n- All other suitors might as well look somewhere else, because **I'm taken!**\r\n\r\n### The Bride sees her Beloved with Eyes of Love\r\n\r\n- My Beloved (Christians speak callously sometimes of God, lost the PRECIOUSNESS, TENDERNESS)\r\n- He can do no wrong!\r\n- Gaurd Your Heart, Preserve your sensitivity to God's presence\r\n- LOVE is COMMITMENT (not some wishy washy emotion)\r\n\r\n### The Bride Adorns Herself with Jewels\r\n\r\n#### ADORN: The Work (We work out what God works in!) The WORK is an expression of the HEART.\r\n\r\n- Hard Work in Preparing getting Ready\r\n\r\n#### What is her motivation? What does HE like? What is He looking for in a Bride?\r\n\r\n- Nothing she can do to make herself his Bride but in accepting his LOVE she is compelled to express her own love.\r\n- The Jewels are provided By Him!!! (Work Out What God works in)\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\n> Isaiah 62:3-5 &mdash; 3 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem* in the hand of thy God. 4 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. 5 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.\r\n\r\nA Vision for Holiness Sees There is no greater Pleasure than for God to rejoice over me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nA Vision for Holiness, Isaiah 61:10\r\nI.\tCatching the Vision (SEEING MORE)\r\n•\tBlind, Drunk on the World (like Ephraim seeing LESS)\r\nIsaiah 28:7 — … they are swallowed up of wine,  … they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.\r\n•\tThings LENT this week \r\nBeginning to Look alot like each other :) | Daily & Multiple times during the day for WORSHIP and the WORD | Ministry of Preachers & Teachers | Mindfulness of God's Presence | Dress Code & Modesty\r\n\r\n•\tSeeing More (Tyler and and Cardboard Box)\r\nBut things LENT   that you would take a hold of the vision | The Cause must be Holiness unto the Lord (separate, other, different, THE TOUCH OF GOD UPON IT, UNCOMMON)\r\n\r\n•\tThe Bible Relates People and God in many different Ways:\r\nCreator and Creature | Savior (Deliverer) and Sinner/Saints/Captive | Friend | Father and Children | Great High Priest and Priests | There is no more important Relationship than God as THE BRIDEGROOM and His people as THE BRIDE\r\nII.\tA Vision for the Holiness of God (Groom)\r\n•\tGOD IS HOLY  Isaiah 6:3 — …, Holy, holy, holy,\r\nWithout a vision for the Holiness of God, we have no MOTIVATION for worship.
