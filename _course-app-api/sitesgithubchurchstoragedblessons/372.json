Diotrephes was in position of leadership of this church and because he &quot;loveth to have the preeminence among them&quot; (v. 9) would not show hospitality to these teachers. What&apos;s more, he would excommunicate any member of his church who would receive them. Gaius, a member of his church, refused to be intimidated and received these teachers who later reported his kindness to John. It seems that John was about to send these teachers out a second time (v. 6) and exhorts Gaius to continue his ministry of love to them. John apparently wrote a letter of remonstrance to Diotrephes, but was ignored. In response to this, John expressed his intention of paying a personal visit to this church and of deposing this ecclesiastical tyrant.</p>\r\n<h3>Theme:</h3> <p>The duty of hospitality toward the ministry and the danger of domineering leadership</p>\r\n<h3>When written:</h3> <p>The Book of III John was most likely written at about the same time as John's other letters, I and II John, approximately A.
