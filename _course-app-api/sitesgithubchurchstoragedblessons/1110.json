The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. \r\n- tares grow even when good seed is sown. did you not sow good seed in your field\r\nEnemy sowing seed.\r\n- Speak the Word - The Power in Speaking the Word\r\n- Live the Word\r\n- \"CAST UPON THE WATERS\"\r\n- Invest in people, relationships\r\n> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\r\nGalatians 6:9\r\n\r\n## The Time is Right\r\n\r\n- don't listen to the wind\r\nUpon the water - like when the  Nile overflowed it's Banks and you can't see where it will land.
