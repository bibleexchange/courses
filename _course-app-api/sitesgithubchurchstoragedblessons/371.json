No doubt her familiarity with him was such that no other introduction was necessary. He speaks of loving them in truth and for the truth. He pronounces grace, mercy and peace to them from the Father and the Son in truth and love.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>Walk in truth, love and obedience (4-6)</h2> \r\n<p>In v. 4, he rejoices that there were those who were walking in the truth and in v. 5 reiterates the command that they should love one another. In verse 6, he states that those who walk in love will walk in obedience to the Lord&apos;s commandments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do not participate in heresy (7-11)</h2> \r\n<p>In verse 7, John speaks of the &quot;deceivers&quot; and how to identify them. In verses 8-9, he admonishes them to beware that they do not allow themselves to be influenced by these false teachers lest they not only lose reward, but lose their very relationship with God. In verses 10-11, he tells them not to receive them into their house or to bid them Godspeed lest they be partakers of their evil deeds. They must be careful not to aid them in any way in their evil work and so take part in it.</p> \r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion (12-13)</h2> \r\n\r\n<p>John had many things he wanted to communicate to them, but chose to wait that he might tell them in person &quot;that our joy may be full&quot;. He passes on a greeting to them in closing. It is of utmost importance that we check everything we see, hear, and read, though it come under the label &quot;Christian,&quot; with the Scriptures. We cannot emphasize this too strongly because one of Satan&apos;s greatest weapons is deceit. It is very easy to be deceived by a new and exciting doctrine that appears to be based on the Word of God but which, if examined closely, is in fact a departure from it. If what we see, hear, and read does not line up explicitly with Scripture, then it is false and not of the Spirit, and we should have nothing to do with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is of utmost importance that we study the word of God diligently now and know the truth so that when we encounter something that conflicts with the word of God, it will be evident and we will recognize it. Don&apos;t wait until you question something to search the word of God. The more you know the word of God, the less likely you will be deceived. Know the truth, love it and obey it. It will keep you from deception and destruction. II Thess 2:8-12; Hosea 4:6</p>"},"type":"READ_HTML_FILE"}
