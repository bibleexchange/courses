<h2>Explanation of "Non-Moral Attributes"</h2>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>The qualities that belong to the substance and constitute a description of it. A description of the nature or qualities of a person</p>
<blockquote>For example&#44; God says of Himself&#44; &quot;I am holy&quot;; therefore we can say&#44; God is holy. Holiness&#44; then is an attribute of God&#44; because holiness is a quality that we may attribute or apply to Him. Doctrine Book </blockquote>
<h3>Non-moral</h3>
<p>Non-moral attributes are those truths of the Divine essence that do not involve moral qualities. It is an inherent quality without regard to right or wrong. Non-moral is not the same as "un-moral" or "immoral".</p>
<h2>Omnipresence</h2>
<h3>The Divine presence in relation to His creatures (Jer. 23:23-24; Acts 17:27-28)</h3>
<blockquote>Psalm 139:7-12 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 8 If I ascend up into heaven&#44; thou art there: if I make my bed in hell&#44; behold&#44; thou art there. 9 If I take the wings of the morning&#44; and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 10 Even there shall thy hand lead me&#44; and thy right hand shall hold me. 11 If I say&#44; Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. 12 Yea&#44; the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.</blockquote>
