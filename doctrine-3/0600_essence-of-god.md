
<h1>Essence of God</h1>
<p>Meaning of ESSENCE: The core substance of anything; the ultimate nature of something; the crucial element; the inherent&#44; unchanging nature of a thing or a class of things.</p>
<p>Who and what is God?&#44;</p>
<blockquote>God is a Spirit&#44; infinite&#44; eternal&#44; and unchangeable in His being&#44; wisdom&#44; power&#44; holiness&#44; justice&#44; goodness&#44; and truth. Westminister Catechism</blockquote>
<blockquote>God is the infinite and perfect Spirit in whom all things have their source&#44; support and end. James Strong</blockquote>
