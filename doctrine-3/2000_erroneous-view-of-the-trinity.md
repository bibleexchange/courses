<h2>Sabellianism</h2>
<h3>Bishop Sabellius taught that Father&#44; Son&#44; and Holy Ghost are simply three aspects or manifestations of God.</h3>
<h3>There are three manifestations of one God.</h3>
<h4>Sometimes this is referred to as three personalities.</h4>
<h4>God does not have split personalities.</h4>
<h3>Oneness teaching falls under this category.</h3>
<h3>Refutation to this view</h3>
<h4>Scripture clearly teaches the plurality of the Godhea</h4>
<p>Elohim is a plural noun.</p>
<blockquote>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. (Gen 1:1)</blockquote>
<p>Plural pronouns used to refer to God.</p>
<blockquote>And God said&#44; Let us make man in our image&#44; after our likenessâ€¦ (Gen. 1:18)</blockquote>
<p>The Bible reveals there are three persons within One God.</p>
<blockquote>1 John 5:7 -- For there are three that bear record in heaven&#44; the Father&#44; the Word&#44; and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.</blockquote> 
<h4>There are sharp distinctions revealed in Scripture between The Father&#44; Son&#44; and Holy Spirit.</h4>
<p>The Father sent The Son &mdash;</p>
<blockquote>For God so loved the world&#44; that he gave his only begotten Son&#44; that whosoever believeth in him should not perish&#44; but have everlasting life (John 3:16) I came forth from the Father&#44; and am come into the world: again&#44; I leave the world&#44; and go to the Father. (Joh 16:28)</blockquote>
<p>The Son returns to The Father --</p>
<blockquote>Jesus saith unto her&#44; Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren&#44; and say unto them&#44; I ascend unto my Father&#44; and your Father; and to my God&#44; and your God. (Joh 20:17) A little while&#44; and ye shall not see me: and again&#44; a little while&#44; and ye shall see me&#44; because I go to the Father. (Joh 16:16)</blockquote>
<p>The Father and Son send The Spirit --</p>
<blockquote>But when the Comforter is come&#44; whom I will send unto you from the Father&#44; even the Spirit of truth&#44; which proceedeth from the Father&#44; he shall testify of me:(Joh 15:26)Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away&#44; the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart&#44; I will send him unto you. (Joh 16:7)</blockquote>
<p>The Spirit intercedes with The Father.</p>
<blockquote>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. (Rom 8:26)</blockquote>
<h4>The Bible defines the oneness of God.</h4>
<blockquote>And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one&#44; even as we are one: (Joh 17:26).</blockquote>
<p>The body is one in unity&#44; yet many in person.</p>
<blockquote>Wherefore they are no more twain&#44; but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together&#44; let not man put asunder. (Mat 19:6)</blockquote>
<p>Husband and wife become one&#44; yet there are still two persons.</p>
<h2>Arianism</h2>
<h3>Arius</h3>
<h4>Presbyter of Alexandria about 318 AD</h4>
<h4>Taught the Son is subordinate to the Father</h4>
<h3>Christ is not eternal in existence.</h3>
<h4>Jesus had a beginning</h4>
<h4>Jesus is a lesser God (REMEMBER THIS IS THE FALSE VIEW!)</h4>
<h3>Refutation to this view.</h3>
<h4>The Son is God</h4>
<blockquote>In the beginning was the Word&#44; and the Word was with God&#44; and the Word was God. (John 1:1)</blockquote>
<h4>Jesus is equal with God</h4>
<blockquote>Let this mind be in you&#44; which was also in Christ Jesus: Who&#44; being in the form of God&#44; thought it not robbery to be equal with God: (Phi 2:5-6)For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. (Col 2:9)</blockquote>
<h4>Christ is eternal.</h4>
<blockquote>I am Alpha and Omega&#44; the beginning and the ending&#44; saith the Lord&#44; which is&#44; and which was&#44; and which is to come&#44; the Almighty. (Rev 1:8)But thou&#44; Bethlehem Ephratah&#44; though thou be little among the thousands of Judah&#44; yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old&#44; from everlasting. (Mic 5:2)</blockquote>
<p>This is a Messianic prophecy.</p>
<h2>Tritheism</h2>
<h3>The belief in three Gods.</h3>
<h3>Refutation to this view.</h3>
<h4>Scripture declares there is One God.</h4>
<blockquote>Deut. 6:4 Hear&#44; O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:</blockquote>
<p>Singular - Plural - Singular</p>
<p>Jehovah our Elohim is one Jehovah</p>
<p>These three are one-- I John 5:7</p>
<h4>One God revealed in three Persons</h4>
<p>Not three Gods</p>
<p>More than one God would be contrary to Scripture</p>
<blockquote>Thou shalt have no other gods before me. (Exodus 20:3)</blockquote>
<h4>Polytheism is an erroneous view of God</h4>
