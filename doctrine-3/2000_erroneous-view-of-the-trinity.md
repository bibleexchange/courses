# Erroneous views 

THESE ARE FALSE VIEWS!

## Sabellianism

### Bishop Sabellius taught that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are simply three aspects or manifestations of God

### There are three manifestations of one God

#### Sometimes this is referred to as three personalities

#### God does not have split personalities

### Oneness teaching falls under this category

### Refutation to this view

#### Scripture clearly teaches the plurality of the Godhead

Elohim is a plural noun.

> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&mdash;Genesis 1:1

Plural pronouns used to refer to God.

> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness&mdash;Genesis 1:18

The Bible reveals there are three persons within One God.

> For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.&mdash;1 John 5:7

#### There are sharp distinctions revealed in Scripture between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

##### The Father sent the Son

> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life&mdash;John 3:16

> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.&mdash;John 16:28

##### The Son returns to the Father

> Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.&mdash;John 20:17

> A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.&mdash;John 16:16

##### The Father and Son send the Spirit

> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:&mdash;John 15:26

> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.&mdash;John 16:7

##### The Spirit intercedes with the Father

> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.&mdash;Romans 8:26

#### The Bible defines the oneness of God.

> And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:&mdash;John 17:26

The body is one in unity, yet many in person.

> Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&mdash;Matthew 19:6

Husband and wife become one, yet there are still two persons.

## Arianism

### Arius

#### Presbyter of Alexandria about  AD 318

#### Taught the Son is subordinate to the Father

### Christ is not eternal in existence

#### Jesus had a beginning

#### Jesus is a lesser God 

REMEMBER THIS IS THE FALSE VIEW!

### Refutation to this view

#### The Son is God

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&mdash;John 1:1

#### Jesus is equal with God

> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:&mdash;Philippians 2:5-6

> For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.&mdash;Colossians 2:9

#### Christ is eternal.

> I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.&mdash;Revelation 1:8

> But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.&mdash;Micah 5:2

This is a Messianic prophecy.

## Tritheism

### The belief in three Gods

### Refutation to this view

#### Scripture declares there is One God

> Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:&mdash;Deuteronomy 6:4 

Singular - Plural - Singular

Jehovah our Elohim is one Jehovah

These three are one (I John 5:7).

#### One God revealed in three Persons

Not three Gods.

More than one God would be contrary to Scripture.

> Thou shalt have no other gods before me.&mdash;Exodus 20:3

#### Polytheism is an erroneous view of God
