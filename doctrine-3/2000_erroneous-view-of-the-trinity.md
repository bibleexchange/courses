# Erroneous views (THESE ARE FALSE VIEWS!)

## Sabellianism

### Bishop Sabellius taught that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are simply three aspects or manifestations of God.

### There are three manifestations of one God.

#### Sometimes this is referred to as three personalities.

#### God does not have split personalities.

### Oneness teaching falls under this category.

### Refutation to this view

#### Scripture clearly teaches the plurality of the Godhea

Elohim is a plural noun.

> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. (Gen 1:1)

Plural pronouns used to refer to God.

> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likenessâ€¦ (Gen. 1:18)

The Bible reveals there are three persons within One God.

> 1 John 5:7 -- For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

#### There are sharp distinctions revealed in Scripture between The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

The Father sent The Son —

> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16) I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. (Joh 16:28)

The Son returns to The Father --

> Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. (Joh 20:17) A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. (Joh 16:16)

The Father and Son send The Spirit --

> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:(Joh 15:26)Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. (Joh 16:7)

The Spirit intercedes with The Father.

> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. (Rom 8:26)

#### The Bible defines the oneness of God.

> And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: (Joh 17:26).

The body is one in unity, yet many in person.

> Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. (Mat 19:6)

Husband and wife become one, yet there are still two persons.

## Arianism

### Arius

#### Presbyter of Alexandria about 318 AD

#### Taught the Son is subordinate to the Father

### Christ is not eternal in existence.

#### Jesus had a beginning

#### Jesus is a lesser God (REMEMBER THIS IS THE FALSE VIEW!)

### Refutation to this view.

#### The Son is God

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (John 1:1)

#### Jesus is equal with God

> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: (Phi 2:5-6)For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. (Col 2:9)

#### Christ is eternal.

> I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. (Rev 1:8)But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting. (Mic 5:2)

This is a Messianic prophecy.

## Tritheism

### The belief in three Gods.

### Refutation to this view.

#### Scripture declares there is One God.

> Deut. 6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

Singular - Plural - Singular

Jehovah our Elohim is one Jehovah

These three are one-- I John 5:7

#### One God revealed in three Persons

Not three Gods

More than one God would be contrary to Scripture

> Thou shalt have no other gods before me. (Exodus 20:3)

#### Polytheism is an erroneous view of God
