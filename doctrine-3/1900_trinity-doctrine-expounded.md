# Trinity Doctrine Expounded

The word trinity means three who are one. It is the idea that God is three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. All three are equal parts of God, but separate persons. The word trinity is not in the Bible but the idea of the triune God is. All through the Bible we can see evidence that supports the trinity. The purpose of this writing is to prove from the Bible that the trinity is sound doctrine and is indeed a fact.

Anything that contradicts the word of God is in error. It is very important that we know what we believe and we understand why we believe it. Our beliefs must be based on the Bible or they are merely the ideas of men. When the ideas of men contradict the Bible they are wrong.

The bible is infallible and the perfect word of God. Scripture must agree with scripture. We cannot take one verse out of the bible and make a doctrine out of it. So in order to have sound doctrine we must compare scripture with scripture. The ideas that are presented here are backed with scripture and agree with the whole word of God.

## THERE ARE THREE IN HEAVEN

> 1 Jo 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

## JESUS WAS SENT BY THE FATHER

It is evident I hope that one cannot send himself. To be sent is to have directions from someone else. Jesus was sent by the Father with a purpose and a mission.

> John 5:36 But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

> John 5:37 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.

> John 5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.

> John 6:39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.

> John 6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.

> John 6:57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.

> John 8:16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.

> John 8:18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.

> John 8:29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.

> John 8:42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.

> John 12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

> John 14:24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.

> John 17:21 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

> John 17:25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.

> John 20:21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.

## JESUS DID NOT COME IN HIS OWN NAME

Jesus came in the name of the Father

> John 5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.

> John 8:42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.

> John 14:24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.

> John 5:43 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.

## NO MAN ONE HAS SEEN OR HEARD THE FATHER

No one has seen or heard the Father, but men have seen and heard God. They saw Jesus, the son of the Father. Jesus is just as much God as the Father, but he is not the Father. There is a difference.

> John 5:37 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.

> John 1:18 No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

## THE FATHER AND THE SON ARE ONE

> John 10:30 I and my Father are one.

> John 17:21 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

> John 17:11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.

## THE FATHER HAS HIS OWN NAME

> John 17:11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.

## THE FATHER AND THE SON HAVE SEPARATE WILLS

This does not mean that they ever disagree. Both are all-knowing and sinless. They have the same desires, the same heart. When Jesus came to the earth he subjected his will to the Father. He came as a servant.

> John 5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me

> Matthew 26:39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

> Matthew 26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.

> Luke 22:42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

## THE FATHER POSSESES A SON AND THE SON POSSESES A FATHER

There is a father-son relationship between Jesus and the Father. When Jesus says my Father that shows possession. It is His Father, not any father, but His Father. When the Father says my son he is showing that he has a son

> Matthew 16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.Matthew 18:10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.

> Matthew 18:19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.

> Matthew 18:35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

> Matthew 20:23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.

> Matthew 24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.

> Matthew 25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:

> Matthew 26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

> Matthew 26:39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

> Mark 10:29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,

> Luke 22:42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

> Luke 23:46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.

> Luke 24:49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

> John 2:16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.

> John 5:17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

> John 5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.

> John 10:25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.John 10:29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.John 10:30 I and my Father are one.
