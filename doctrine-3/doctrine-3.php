<p>'.trans('doctrine-3.This Scripture tells us God reveals Himself through His creation. The invisible things of God are seen in the creation of the world. The Scripture explains it is God&apos;s eternal power that is shown forth in His creation. The Godhead is also revealed through His creation.

Think of the greatness of the universe. Our own sun&#44; which is considered a small star&#44; emits more energy in one second than has been used by man since the beginning of time. Let us also consider the power of the wind: the hurricanes&#44; tornadoes&#44; and storms that have wrecked havoc to everything in their path. All of this is only natural power.

The butterflies lay eggs in Mexico before they die and the new butterflies migrate back to North America where there parents were hatched. These butterflies consistently fly to a place they have never been to without getting lost. What other explanation for this migration other than the will of God. How is it that hydrogen and oxygen&#44; two explosive gases&#44; do not explode when combined to form a water molecule? The little acorn contains the blueprint for the great oak tree. Who tells the male stag horn beetle to allow room in his cocoon for his antennae while the female does not? The wonders of creation are not by chance; they are the work of God. ').'</p> 
<h3>'.trans('doctrine-3.Argument from Design').'</h3> 
<p>'.trans('doctrine-3.The universe is designed with such exactness and precision that it could not have just randomly happened by chance. [Let us consider an analogy from Physics expert Robin Collins PHD: Imagine a ruler&#44; or one of those old fashioned linear radio dials&#44; that goes all the way across the universe. It would be broken down into one-inch increments&#44; which means there would be billions upon billions upon billions of inches. The entire dial represents the range of force strengths in nature&#44; with gravity being the weakest force and the strong nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons together being the strongest&#44; ten thousand billion billion billion billion times stronger than gravity. Now let&apos;s imagine you want to move the dial from where it is currently set. Even if you were to move it only one inch&#44; the impact on life would be catastrophic. That small adjustment of the dial would increase gravity by a billion-fold. Animals anywhere the size of human beings would be crushed. As you can see&#44; compared to the total range of force strengths in nature&#44; gravity has an incomprehensibly narrow range for life to exist. Of all the possible settings on the dial&#44; from one side of the universe to the other&#44; it happens to be situated in the exact right fraction of an inch to make our universe capable of sustaining life.]').'</p> 
<p>'.trans('doctrine-3.There is an astronomical term called the cosmological constant which was first introduced by Einstien and is now used to refer the energy density of empty space. This is a complex subject of physics that we will not try to explain in this class. Yet&#44; we can look at the exactness of the fine tuning of this mathematical figure in relation to the universe. This constant has to be set with exactness in order for the universe to even exist. [According to Robin Collins PHD : The fine tuning (of the cosmological constant) has conservatively been estimated to be at least one part in a hundred million billion billion billion billion billion. That would be a ten followed by fifty-three zeroes. That is inconceivably precise.]').'</p> 
<p>'.trans('doctrine-3.There are also other variables in the universe that require an exactness of precision for the very existence of the universe itself. [For example&#44; Oxford physicist Roger Penrose said one parameter&#44; &quot;the original space volume&quot;&#44; required fine tuning to an accuracy of one part in ten billion multiplied by itself one hundred and twenty-three times. Penrose remarked that it would be impossible to even write down that number in full&#44; since it would require more zeroes than the number of elementary particles in the entire universe! This showed&#44; he said&#44; &quot;the precision needed to set the universe on its course.&quot;]').'</p> 
<p>'.trans('doctrine-3.We could go on and on with examples within the universe that require exact accuracy of design for there even to be a universe in existence. [For instance&#44; there&apos;s the difference in mass between neutrons and protons. Increase the mass of the neutron by about one part in seven hundred and nuclear fusion in stars would stop. There would be no energy source for life. And if the electromagnetic force were slightly stronger or weaker&#44; life in the universe would be impossible. Or consider the strong nuclear force. Imagine decreasing it by fifty percent&#44; which is tiny- one part in ten billion billion billion billion&#44; compared to the total range of force strengths. Since like charges repel&#44; the strong nuclear force would be too weak to prevent the repulsive force between the positively charged protons in atomic nuclei from tearing apart all atoms except hydrogen. Robin Collins PHD.] Obviously without atoms which are the building blocks of all substance there would be nothing in existence. ').'</p> 
<p>'.trans('doctrine-3.This design is too precise to have happened by chance&#44; the only logical explanation for such precision design is that there was a designer. ').'</p> 
<p>'.trans('doctrine-3.It is impossible to have a design without a designer. God is the designer of all of nature. The vast design is too accurate to be the result of coincidence or randomness as the result of a big bang as some scientists claim. For example&#44; if the earth tilted one degree either way on its axis earth would not be inhabitable. This is not to mention that earth is the precise distance from the sun and placed in the exact location within the Milky Way Galaxy within which earth is located to support life on our planet .
