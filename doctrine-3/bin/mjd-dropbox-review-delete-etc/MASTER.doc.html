As one in authority, master applies to slaveholders and to heads of households (which in biblical times frequently included slaves or servants). Greek terms translated master (of servants or a household) include despotes, kyrios, oikodespotes (Mark 13:35; Luke 13:25; 14:21; 16:13; Eph. 6:9). 2. KJV regularly translated the Greek didaskalos (teacher) as master in the Gospels (as in Matt. 8:19; 9:11). KJV twice rendered kathegetse (guide, teacher) as master (Matt. 23:8,10). KJV sometimes also translated rabbi (rabbi, teacher) and rabboni (my rabbi, my teacher) as master (Matt. 26:25; Mark 9:5; John 4:31). Modern translations render the above terms as teacher or rabbi. Luke often uses epistates (manager, chief) where Matthew and Mark have teacher (didaskalos), rabbi, or Lord (for example, Luke 5:5; 8:24,45; 9:33,49; 17:13).</span></p></body>
