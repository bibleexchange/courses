Lester, Ph.D.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs5274B2F7"><span class="csE613E19A">For a considerable number of years it has been important for Christians with training in science to gather evidence which demonstrates the scientific necessity of supernatural creation to explain the history of life. &nbsp;However, sufficient evidence has now accumulated to convince anyone whose philosophy does not hinder him or her. &nbsp;Although it will continue to be an important ministry for scientists to add to this body of evidence, it is now time for creation scientists to devote more of their resources to &ldquo;doing science&rdquo; within the creation perspective. &nbsp;This paper will hopefully serve as an example of this new emphasis. &nbsp;It is also intended to provide some information in an area of interest to many.</span></p><p class="cs5274B2F7"><span class="csE613E19A">Ancient literature indicates that people have always had some awareness of inheritance, some appreciation for the fact that children resemble their parents. &nbsp;However, it was not until the middle 1800&rsquo;s that Gregor Mendel discovered the basic principles of heredity. &nbsp;And it was not until the middle 1900&rsquo;s that scientists began to uncover the chemical processes that control inheritance. &nbsp;Now every school child learns about deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the molecules with which the &ldquo;book of genes&rdquo; is written. &nbsp;DNA serves as the master blueprint determining the possibilities for our physical features. &nbsp;Each cell of your body has two sets of &ldquo;blueprints&rdquo;, one from your mother and one from your father. &nbsp;The cell uses that information to produce the combination of traits that is uniquely yours.</span></p><p class="cs5274B2F7"><span class="csE613E19A">The molecules of DNA are extremely large and complex, and much remains to be learned about the exact ways they control heredity. &nbsp;In order to discuss inheritance in a more easily understandable way, we use symbols to represent the DNA that controls individual traits. &nbsp;For example, there is a DNA molecule that determines whether a person will have red hair or some other color. &nbsp;We can symbolize the form of the DNA that produces red hair with </span><span class="cs5E0337C">c</span><span class="csE613E19A"> and the form of that same molecule that results in non-red hair as </span><span class="cs5E0337C">C</span><span class="csE613E19A">. &nbsp;Because, as pointed out earlier, each cell has two sets of DNA blueprints, we will have to use two letter </span><span class="cs5E0337C">c</span><span class="csE613E19A">&rsquo;s to represent the DNA which controls red vs. non-red hair. &nbsp;Each person can therefore be said to be </span><span class="cs5E0337C">CC</span><span class="csE613E19A">, </span><span class="cs5E0337C">Cc</span><span class="csE613E19A">, or </span><span class="cs5E0337C">cc</span><span class="csE613E19A">, depending on the forms of the DNA they receive from their parents. &nbsp;It turns out that a person need receive only one </span><span class="cs5E0337C">C</span><span class="csE613E19A"> to have non-red hair, so both </span><span class="cs5E0337C">CC</span><span class="csE613E19A"> and </span><span class="cs5E0337C">Cc</span><span class="csE613E19A"> will produce non-red hair while only </span><span class="cs5E0337C">cc</span><span class="csE613E19A"> will result in red.</span></p><p class="cs5274B2F7"><span class="csE613E19A">Although each of the body cells contains two sets of DNA blueprints, a special type of cell division causes sperms and eggs to contain only one set. &nbsp;Then when fertilization (the joining of sperm and egg) produces the first cell of the new life, it will have a set of blueprints from each parent. &nbsp;By the way, the set of blueprints that goes into a particular sperm or egg is not either the grandfather&rsquo;s or the grandmother&rsquo;s but rather a mixture of the two.</span></p><p class="cs5274B2F7"><span class="csE613E19A">With that bit of genetics theory under our belts we are ready to consider the characteristic with which this article is concerned, namely, skin color. &nbsp;We will be studying only differences in darkness and not those differences which some perceive as yellow or red. &nbsp;Statistical research has indicated that from four to six DNA blueprints are involved in controlling this trait. &nbsp;For at least some degree of simplicity, we will assume that only four blueprints control skin color. &nbsp;If in truth there are more involved, the same principles would apply. &nbsp;Now let&rsquo;s consider some of the details of the inheritance of skin color, using forms of the letters </span><span class="cs5E0337C">a</span><span class="csE613E19A">, </span><span class="cs5E0337C">b</span><span class="csE613E19A">, </span><span class="cs5E0337C">c</span><span class="csE613E19A">, and </span><span class="cs5E0337C">d</span><span class="csE613E19A"> to represent the DNA blueprints involved. &nbsp;According to the system we are using, the darkest person can be represented as having </span><span class="cs5E0337C">AABBCCDD</span><span class="csE613E19A">, and the lightest as </span><span class="cs5E0337C">aabbccdd</span><span class="csE613E19A">. &nbsp;The forms of DNA which we are representing with capital letters each add a degree of color. &nbsp;A person with an </span><span class="cs5E0337C">AaBbCcDd</span><span class="csE613E19A"> makeup would be intermediate in color as would someone with </span><span class="cs5E0337C">AABBccdd</span><span class="csE613E19A"> or </span><span class="cs5E0337C">aabbCCDD</span><span class="csE613E19A">, or any other combination of four capital letters.</span></p><p class="cs5274B2F7"><span class="csE613E19A">Now we&rsquo;ll consider the origin of skin colors in humans. &nbsp;Some have proposed that originally there was only one type of blueprint, which we might symbolize as </span><span class="cs5E0337C">AABBCCDD</span><span class="csE613E19A"> or </span><span class="cs5E0337C">aabbccdd</span><span class="csE613E19A">. &nbsp;This theory states that mutations, genetic mistakes in copying the DNA blueprints, produced the other forms responsible for other skin colors. &nbsp;The major difficulty with this idea is that almost all mutations are harmful, and it is known that different skin colors are beneficial in different climates. &nbsp;Therefore, we would not expect that beneficial differences would arise from mistakes, but would rather have been provided by the Creator. &nbsp;Is it possible that one created couple, Adam and Eve, could have been given the genetic potential for all of the colors we see today?</span></p><p class="cs5274B2F7"><span class="csE613E19A">The answer is most definitely </span><span class="cs5E0337C">yes</span><span class="csE613E19A">, and in fact there are a number of different possibilities. &nbsp;One would be where one spouse had a completely different blueprint from the other. &nbsp;If one of the original parents was </span><span class="cs5E0337C">AABBCCDD</span><span class="csE613E19A"> and the other </span><span class="cs5E0337C">aabbccdd</span><span class="csE613E19A">, all of their children would be </span><span class="cs5E0337C">AaBbCcDd</span><span class="csE613E19A">. &nbsp;The recombination of these blueprints could, in future generations, produce all of the shades now present. &nbsp;Of course, this would mean Adam and Eve would be opposite extremes in color, and their children would be brown. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t my purpose to raise, at this point, the topic of interracial marriages, but I suspect that it might have been simpler for the first family if they had all been the same color.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">There is, perhaps, some Scriptural evidence for this, however slim. &nbsp;Recall that when Adam came out of the anesthetic and saw Eve for the first time, he was inspired to speak (or sing?) the first love poem in the Bible:</span></p><p class="csE602B7F2"><span class="csE613E19A">&ldquo;This is now bone of my bones,</span></p><p class="csE602B7F2"><span class="csE613E19A">And flesh of my flesh;</span></p><p class="csE602B7F2"><span class="csE613E19A">She shall be called Woman,</span></p><p class="cs4A90F57C"><span class="csE613E19A">Because she was taken out of man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs81D8DA5E"><span class="csE613E19A">Not particularly romantic, perhaps, but remember it was humanity&rsquo;s first attempt at poetry. &nbsp;At least it seems pretty clear that Adam had no trouble recognizing that Eve was his kind of woman.</span></p><p class="cs5274B2F7"><span class="csE613E19A">Not to make too large an issue out of it, I would like to propose a genetic possibility for the parents of us all that would have caused them minimal confusion. &nbsp;Such a possibility (and not the only one) would have Adam with </span><span class="cs5E0337C">AABBccdd</span><span class="csE613E19A"> and Eve with </span><span class="cs5E0337C">aabbCCDD</span><span class="csE613E19A">. &nbsp;They would both be the same brown color because each would possess four color-producing blueprints. &nbsp;All of their children would be </span><span class="cs5E0337C">AaBbCcDd</span><span class="csE613E19A"> and the same color as their parents. &nbsp;Future generations would produce the whole &ldquo;rainbow&rdquo; of skin colors.</span></p><p class="cs4817DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">We can see definitely in this one example that there is no need to invoke unexpected beneficial mutations in order to explain the diversity in our own species. &nbsp;The inheritance patterns of other characteristics are not all as well known as that of skin color. &nbsp;It may be that one or more of the features that distinguish one population from another is the result of a genetic mistake somewhere in our past. &nbsp;But if such a variable trait as skin color could have come from a single created couple, there is no reason to think that most, if not virtually all, of the rich diversity possessed by our species was given to us at the beginning by our gracious Creator.</span></p></body>
