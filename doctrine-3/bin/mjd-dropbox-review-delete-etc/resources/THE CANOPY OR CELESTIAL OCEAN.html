		<p class="cs2E86D3A6"><span class="csAEEDF97E">By James L. Hall</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csAEEDF97E">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Scripture teaches that there was an ocean of water existing above the firmament or atmosphere in Genesis 1:6-8. &nbsp;This was day number two in the creation week. &nbsp;An entire day of creation week was devoted to the placing of this water above the firmament.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">The existence of this canopy would have produced an ideal climate over the entire earth. &nbsp;The canopy collapsed during the flood of Noah&rsquo;s time and took 40 days to dissipate which is the 40 days and 40 nights spoken of in Genesis 7:12.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">This ocean of water would have been turned to a vapor (superheated steam) due to the lower pressure and higher temperature. &nbsp;A minimum of 40 feet of water and condensing at the rate of 0.5 inches per hour is required in our model to fulfill the scriptural requirement of raining 40 days and nights.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">The weight of this ocean of water resting on our atmosphere would create a pressure approximately of 2.18 atmospheres or 32.04 lbs. per square inch.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">This canopy would produce a number of interesting results. &nbsp;First of all, there would be a &ldquo;greenhouse effect&rdquo; produced over the entire earth. &nbsp;Temperatures would be uniformly mild with relatively high humidity. &nbsp;Geological evidence suggests there were no mountain ranges just rolling hills. &nbsp;These factors would prevent any global circulation of wind and air currents taking place. &nbsp;This would mean no rainfall, hail, ice, or snow. &nbsp;In other words there would be no seasons just one uniform mild climate existing over the entire earth.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Climatologists and meteorologists know that a canopy would cause no rainfall and that the earth would be watered by a diurnal dew system. &nbsp;It is rather remarkable that the scriptures indicate that this is exactly what occurred. &nbsp;Genesis 2:5,6, &ldquo;&hellip;for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">These are rather remarkable verses especially when viewed in the light of science. &nbsp;How did Moses know these correct facts in 1450 BC when the book of Genesis was supposed to have been written.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">The canopy would filter out harmful short wave radiation such as infra-red and cosmic rays. &nbsp;It is known that cosmic rays can cause harmful mutations to the genes in living organisms.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Combine this fact with the increased atmospheric pressure under the canopy and we have the conditions for longevity and creatures growing to very large sizes.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">For example consider the dinosaur Diplodocus who attained a length from head to toe of over 90 feet. &nbsp;This specimen was first collected from the famous Morrison formation in Utah by workers from the Carnegie Museum during the 1920s under the sponsorship of Andrew Carnegie. &nbsp;It was named in honor of Andrew Carnegie (Diplodocus carnegii).</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Not only were the dinosaurs large but all the organisms grew to very large size under the protective shield of this canopy. &nbsp;Fossil dragonflies have been found with wingspans from 2-3 feet. &nbsp;Since we do not see this element of large size on our present environment we deduce that the canopy provided the conditions necessary to attain this fact.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">The pressure increase would increase the oxygen tension over the surface of organisms thus allowing more oxygen to be available to the tissues. &nbsp;Longevity and rapid healing appear to be linked to two atmospheres of pressure.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Fossil palm trees, mammoths, coral reefs, and oil have been found in the Arctic regions. &nbsp;Fossil crocodiles have been found in New Jersey, England, and the Antarctic. &nbsp;All of these fossils substantiate the scriptural claim of a universal climate, which results from the existence of the canopy.</span></p><p class="cs1835DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">Scripture indicates that there was a time when man&rsquo;s every thought and deed was evil. &nbsp;The world was filled with violence (Genesis 6). &nbsp;II Peter 3:6 states that, &ldquo;the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.&rdquo; &nbsp;This is the flood of Noah&rsquo;s time that was caused in part by the collapse of this canopy or ocean of water above the atmosphere. &nbsp;This event produced our present world with its high mountains, changing seasons, short life spans, and fossil deposits.</span></p><p class="cs4817DA29"><span class="csE613E19A">In another monograph, I will deal with the Flood.</span></p></body>
