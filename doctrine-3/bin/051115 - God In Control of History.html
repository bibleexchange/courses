The story of the flood is an absolute quintessential fact; it is a foundation, upon which many other facts are founded. The story of the flood gives adherence to the Biblical record and scientific facts and to the geological renderings of a worldwide flood and not an ages concept. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It must be understood that the geological ages concept (evolutionary in essence) and a worldwide devastating flood logically cannot coexist. &nbsp;That is why the story of a global flood is so devastating to the evolutionists; because the proof of a flood would support so many other facts for belief in a worldwide flood. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And the facts do point to a worldwide flood; even the early geologists (Steno, Woodward, etc&hellip;) taught this. It has been our modern geologists that have argued on the side of evolutionary ages concept. Yet so many facts point to the worldwide flood. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">That is why one of the strongest evidences for the global flood which annihilated all people on Earth except for Noah and his family has been the ubiquitous presence of flood legends in the folklore of people groups from around the world. And the stories are so similar. These stories have been reported by various missionaries, anthropologists, ethnologists. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">And from those stories we have gathered this:</span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">

		<p class="csF70856CC"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Putting them all back together, the story would read: </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&ldquo;Once there was a worldwide flood, sent by God to judge wickedness of man. But there was one righteous family which was forewarned of the coming flood. They built a boat on which they survived the flood along with the animals. As the flood ended, their boat landed on a high mountain from which they descended and repopulated the whole earth.&ldquo;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The most similar accounts are typically from middle eastern cultures, but surprisingly similar legends are found in South America and the Pacific Islands and elsewhere. None contains the beauty, clarity, and detail as given in the Bible.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Anthropologists will tell you that myth is often the faded memory of a real event. Details may have been added, lost, or obscured in the telling and retelling, but the kernel of truth remains. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">When two separate cultures have the same &ldquo;myth&rdquo; in their body of folklore, their ancestors must have either experienced the same event, or they both descended from a common ancestral source which itself experienced the event. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The probability of the story of the flood still being told today with so many similar details, by so many different cultures, is hard to fathom. Just think of the children&rsquo;s game &ldquo;telephone&rdquo;, and in the game when you get past a few people, the message usually changes to something not even close or recognizable, especially by the last person. But God has preserved this story throughout the thousands of years, and many different languages and cultures. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The story of the flood is a fact that has been passed on from generation to generation, and that has been proven over and over again by scientific fact, and has been stamped and sealed by the Word of God.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs78AB3212">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csEF956D1"><span class="cs707478BA">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
