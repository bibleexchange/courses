All three are equal parts of God, but separate persons. The word trinity is not in the Bible but the idea of the triune God is. All through the Bible we can see evidence that supports the trinity. The purpose of this writing is to prove from the Bible that the trinity is sound doctrine and is indeed a fact. I am not trying to attack anyone or their beliefs, but anything that contradicts the word of God is in error. It is very important that we know what we believe and we understand why we believe it. Our beliefs must be based on the Bible or they are merely the ideas of men. When the ideas of men contradict the Bible they are wrong. The bible is infallible and the perfect word of God. Scripture must agree with scripture. We cannot take one verse out of the bible and make a doctrine out of it. So in order to have sound doctrine we must compare scripture with scripture. The ideas that are presented here are backed with scripture and agree with the whole word of God.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">THERE ARE THREE IN HEAVEN</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csC382D2BB">1Jo 5:7 &ldquo; For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">JESUS WAS SENT BY THE FATHER</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">It is evident I hope that one cannot send himself.
