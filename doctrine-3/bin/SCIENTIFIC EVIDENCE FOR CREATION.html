			<li class="csC9CB04B0"><span class="csE613E19A">The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the total quantity of matter and energy in the universe is constant. &nbsp;The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that matter and energy always tend to change from complex and ordered states. &nbsp;Therefore the universe could not have created itself, but could not have existed forever, or it would have run down long ago. &nbsp;Thus the universe, including matter and energy, apparently must have been created.</span></li><li class="csC9CB04B0"><span class="csE613E19A">Complex life appears suddenly in the fossil record with no fossil ancestral forms in older rocks.</span></li></ol>
		<p class="cs1D1DEB2"><span class="csE613E19A">During the chemical evolution of life, random mixtures of &ldquo;L-Amino Acids&rdquo; and &ldquo;D-Amino Acids&rdquo; always produce proteins with a 50% mix of &ldquo;L&rdquo; forms and 50% &ldquo;D&rdquo; forms when it is known that living organisms are composed of exclusively 100% &ldquo;L&rdquo; forms. &nbsp;</span><span class="cs3BC4135E">There is no known mechanism that operates to produce 100% &ldquo;L&rdquo; forms of amino acids in living organisms.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csC9CB04B0"><span class="csE613E19A">Lack of transitional fossils between fossilized kinds in the fossil record. &nbsp;Example would be the fossils demonstrating the transition from a fish to the amphibian. &nbsp;The few suggested links such as Archaeopteryx and the horse series have been rendered questionable by more detailed data. &nbsp;A kind may be defined as a generally common set of traits but that does not interbreed with other groups of organisms under normal circumstances. &nbsp;Any evolutionary change between kinds (necessary for the emergence of complex from simple organisms) would require the addition of entirely new traits to the common set and enormous expansion of the gene pool over time, and could not occur from mere ecologically adaptive variations of a given trait set which the creation model recognizes.</span></li><li class="csC9CB04B0"><span class="csE613E19A">Mutation and natural selection are insufficient to have brought about any emergence of present living kinds from a simple primordial organism. &nbsp;The mathematical probability that random mutation and natural selection ultimately produced complex living kinds from a simpler kind is infinitesimally small even after billions of years.</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">Mutations are nearly always harmful in an organism&rsquo;s natural environment. &nbsp;Harmful mutations would have accumulated by this supposed process and would have resulted in degeneration and extinction rather than improvement.</span></li><li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">Natural selection is nothing more than circular reasoning. &nbsp;It requires the fittest organisms to leave the most offspring and at the same time it identifies the fittest organisms as those that leave the most offspring. &nbsp;Therefore natural selection does not offer a testable explanation of how mutations would produce more fit organisms.</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="5" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csC9CB04B0"><span class="csE613E19A">Man and apes have a separate ancestry. &nbsp;Many imaginary transitional forms have been proposed by the evolutionists from fragmentary evidence for the relationship between man and apes. &nbsp;Consider the following:</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">Nebraska man was proposed from a pig&rsquo;s tooth.</span></li><li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">Piltdown Man was a fraudulent attempt to create a transitional form.</span></li><li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">Neanderthal man was once considered sub-human but now considered fully human.</span></li><li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">Australopithecus, such as &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo;, is considered by some evolutionary biologists, such as Charles Oxnard, to be nothing more than knuckle walking apes.</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="6" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="csC9CB04B0"><span class="csE613E19A">Catastrophic events have characterized the earth&rsquo;s history. &nbsp;Geologic data reflect catastrophic flooding. &nbsp;Evidences of rapid catastrophic water deposition include fossilized tree trunks that penetrate numerous sedimentary layers (such as at Joggins, Nova Scotia), widespread pebble and boulder layers (such as the Shinarump Conglomerate of the southwestern United States), fossilized logs in a single layer covering extensive areas (such as Petrified Forest Park), fossilized rain prints (such as those in New York State), and whole closed calms buried alive in mass graveyards in extensive sedimentary layers (such as Glen Rose, Texas).</span></li><li class="csC9CB04B0"><span class="csE613E19A">There is evidence that the earth is relatively young. &nbsp;Some of this evidence includes the following:</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			<li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">Uranium decays into lead. &nbsp;This process liberates helium-4 into the atmosphere. &nbsp;Estimating by the rate of addition of helium into the atmosphere from this process (even allowing for moderate helium escape) appears to be about 10,000 years.</span></li><li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">The decay of the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field follows an exponential decay curve which shows that the magnetic field was at a 100% of capacity around 10,000 years ago.</span></li><li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">Hydrogen converts to helium. &nbsp;There is no genesis of hydrogen taking place. &nbsp;If the earth is billions of years old there should be no hydrogen left, but high levels of hydrogen indicate a young earth.</span></li><li class="cs63AF2064"><span class="csE613E19A">An isotope of polonium has a half life of </span><span class="cs3BC4135E">164 micro seconds</span><span class="csE613E19A">. &nbsp;The presence of polonium halos from this isotope in the Precambrian rocks show rapid creation of the earth&rsquo;s foundation rocks.</span></li></ol>
