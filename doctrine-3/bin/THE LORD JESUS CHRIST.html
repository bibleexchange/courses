Even though in the Old Testament Christ had not yet been manifested in the flesh, He still existed with the Father and appears in the Old Testament to humanity as God. And since we know from Scripture that no man hath seen God the Father at any time these Old Testament appearances of God could only have been Christ who is the eternal declaration of the Father.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs3B0A1ABE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">1.

Some try to erroneously claim that since Jesus is a Greek rendition of a Hebrew name that it is not the true name of the Christ. The devil hates the name of Jesus. There has been much personal testimony of the power of the name of Jesus to heal the sick, raise the dead and to cast out devils. This writer has seen the demons flee at the name of Jesus spoken in English, Spanish, and Swahili; the demons know the power of the name of Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Mark 16:17 &ndash; And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Philippians 2:10 &ndash; That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Acts 4:10 &ndash; Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Acts 4:12 &ndash; Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">	</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">B.

Joseph was not the father of Jesus: the Scripture tells us plainly that Jesus was conceived of the Holy Ghost. The living eternal word took upon Him the form of man that He might redeem man. Remember that Jesus existed before He was born of the virgin Mary; Nebuchadnezzar declared the form fourth man in the fire is like the Son of God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Peter received a revelation from the Father of who Jesus is.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Matthew 16:16 &ndash; And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csCF6BBF71">D.

Jesus is a direct descendent of King David as listed in the genealogies of both Matthew and Luke. The accounts follow from the line of Joseph who was not the natural father, but would have been the legal line of succession to the throne.
