<p><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>Opening Remarks</b></font></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">	Song
of Solomon cannot be approached with natural understanding because
the Song of Solomon is a spiritual book. If you read the Song of
Solomon from the natural view, you are going to have mixed emotions.
You will have very strange opinions. This has happened before, but I
trust that before you form any deep opinions that you would listen to
the Bible lessons and put all the pieces together before you pass
judgment. If you hear only a part of a conversation, then you could
get a total different picture or impression of what was meant then if
you had heard the whole conversation. Am I right? </font>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">	It
would be well for you to read the Song of Solomon before you continue
with this study. There are only eight very short chapters; it is not
a very long book. You could probably read the whole book in less than
forty-five minutes. This will provide you with at least a surface
understanding of the book. You will not understand all that is there
after the first time you read it. A lot of people in their whole
lifetime do not ever attempt to understand the Song of Solomon. They
know it is in the Bible and that is pretty much it, and some I think
are even ashamed it is in the Bible. The Song of Solomon is not
something to be ashamed of; it is a beautiful book when rightly
interpreted and understood.</font></p>

am going to simply give you an introduction to the book of Song of
Solomon, and give you some background and foundational material in
relation to the Song. I am doing this to get you ready for the
exegesis over the text itself. We will spend quite amount of time
with the exposition of this book. We will without question be months
on this study. That might scare you. &quot;Oh, I am going to be
listening to the Song of Solomon for months?&quot; I am sure if the Holy
Spirit will grant this teacher and preacher His anointing, when we
get to the end of the book you will be sad and say, &quot;Oh, I wish
there was more.&quot; Now, if it is left up to me alone, you will wish
before tonight is over that we were not going into the book of Song
of Solomon.</font></font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">many
do not believe that the Song of Solomon is an inspired book. All they
see is a demonstration of a love affair, an earthly feeling between a
lover and her friend.</font></p>
<p class="western" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>

</p>
<p style="font-weight: normal"> <font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I
am believing that the Holy Spirit ahs heard prayer and is this
includes Bible scholars, Bible interpreters, some commentators, and
those that have a made a deep study of the Bible but not really
having a deep understanding of the Word of God, do not feel that the
book of Solomon even belongs in the canon of the Bible. There are a
lot of people that do not believe that this book was an inspired
book, and it ought to have no place in the Holy Word of God. The
reason why is that it appears to them as nothing more than a
demonstration of a love affair&mdash;nothing more than feelings between a
lover and her friend. Because they feel it is nothing more than a
story talking of earthly love, they totally miss the purpose of it;
therefore, they say it should not be in the Bible. The reason why I
say all of this is to prepare you for some of the expressions that
are found in the Song of Solomon. It is not an earthly dealing or
expression. We are talking about something that is holy. We are not
in the outer court when you go into the book of Song of Solomon. You
are not even in the inner court room. You are not even in the outer
part of the sanctuary in the holy place. You have moved beyond the
veil and slipped into that most holy place in the presence of
almighty God and he&apos;s sharing his divine affection for you. Not as
an earthly thing but as a heavenly thing. I heard a preacher say one
time, you want love stories read the song of Solomon. It is something
more than that. This is a beautiful book; it is a spiritual book. Of
course we could say many things in relation to that, but the whole
Bible itself I our day , the devil is very subtle. He&apos;s pretty much
honeycombed the whole book. Ever see a piece of timber that was it
looked like it had all of it shaped but if you ever put your foot on
it it was all eaten out. It was deteriorated yet still holding its
form. This is what has happened in many places to the Word of God.
They have just , its all honeycombed, they have taken out this and
they have taken out that set this aside and set that aside until you
wonder what is left? But you know how much God has left behind for us
saints? He preserved for us the <b>whole</b> loaf. It is all God&apos;s
Word, even the Song of Songs. It is is God&apos;s Word and it has got
life. You can prepare you mind for what is there in that book, you
will began to find that there is a relationship made that you have
never understood how much that God wants you. Let me just share this
with you if I can. If you love somebody, what is the most important
thing if you really somebody? Yes, we do that we show that, but
really the reason why we even do things for the one we love is
because we want to see their reaction. WE love them so much, we do
things for them because we love them, but the whole thing we just
love to be with them. If you love somebody you just want to be with
them. You can take a stick and beat them away and then they come
back. I can remember when I was as just a little fellow, I could not
say it was love, cause I do not know if little fellows know what love
is all about, but I sure had a whole lot of feeling. A little girl
lived up on the hill and I used to ride my bicycle in pouring down
rain and I knew before I left my house that her momma or daddy would
not let her go out of the house and they were not going to in any way
let me in, but I would ride that bicycle I think it was over three
miles many times in right pouring down rain just to ride by the house
hoping I could see her and then turn around and ride all the way back
home&mdash;puppy love. I was a just a little fellow and I thought my
feelings, my feelings were involved. You can&apos;t get involved like
that and not ride a bicycle in the pouring down rain. I tired in the
winter, and I even tried to ride a bicycle on the slippery ground,
and there was a neighbor next door. I use to go down and I didn&apos;t
really care for that kid he was kind of &quot;soft&quot;, but I used to go
down there and play with him because it was right across the street
from her and once in a while her dad would let her come over. I would
spend hours waiting to see her. To give you an understanding of what
I am trying to stay. God loves you. Did you hear what I said? God
loves you. Is He just interested in doing something for you? He wants
to be with you. He loves you. And there is only one thing that can
stop him from being with you and do you know what that is? Self. The
devil cannot stop Him. &quot;Devil, get out of the way or I&apos;ll run
right over you!&quot; You will find all through this book God making
advances to be with the one he loves. And you will find in the book
revelations of our attitude towards his advances. &quot;Well, I&apos;m a
quite busy right now; he can wait a little while.&quot; Or &quot;I&apos;m a
little bit drowsy.&quot; In one place she says, &quot;I have already put
off my coat and I am not going to get up now,&quot; but when she finally
made up her mind that she was going to get up and go he had decided
he had already waited long enough. Just because he loves us does not
mean he is always going to wait. No, he wants to feelings to be
mutual. Did you ever try to love somebody that didn&apos;t love you? I
do not know if you could call it love, but, again, I had a lot of
feelings for someone and man they would not pay any attention to me.
Finally I got disgusted and the more I took on that attitude they
chased me around like a little puppy dog and I didn&apos;t&apos; want them.
My feelings had changed. <font color="#000000">Let us not let his
feelings change towards because were are occupied too busy.</font></font></font></p>
