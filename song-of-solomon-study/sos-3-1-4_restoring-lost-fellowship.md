# Restoring Lost Fellowship

text: Song of Solomon 3:1-4

## Introduction

> Song of Solomon 3:1-4 &mdash; 1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not. 2 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not. 3 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? 4 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.

## I. The Need to Search - "I sought Him"

### 1. Something had separated them.

### 2. When the Holy Spirit is grieved then fellowship is broken.

### 3. THINGS have a way of separating us.

### 4. She sought Him because she feels deeply her need.

### 5. The more precious and real He is to us, the more we deeply feel the loss of fellowship.

## II. The Time to Search - "By Night"

### 1. When you FIRST feel your loss. The sense of darkness.

### 2. It is always night, when He is not there.

### 3. Distance implies darkness as He is the light!

### 4. Don't wait until you lose the FEELING OF NEED.

## III. The Manner of Search - 

### 1. "On My Bed"

The bed is a place of ease and inactivity. He is not found lying on her bed.

> Jeremiah 29:13 &mdash; And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.

### 2. "In the Streets"

She is out of bed and out into Society. She is seeking the living among the dead. (Luke 24:5)

### 3. Among "the Watchmen"

Watchmen today are not in touch with Him.
