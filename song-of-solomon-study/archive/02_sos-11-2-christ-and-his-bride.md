## I. The Setting of the Song

Song of Solomon begins with an earthly setting, but goes far beyond that

The main focal point of this book is Christ and His Bride.

- There is a young maiden spoken of throughout the song that is the delight of Solomon&rsquo;s eye. She stands out from all the rest. 
- This lady that Solomon tries to seduce will not let him, and she will not even look upon him. She will not be seduced by his **popularity**, by his **position** or by his **prosperity**.

She has **a single eye** to one little shepherd boy that is out on the hillside, and she loves him beyond anything that Solomon can offer to her as king. SOS 1:7; 

- Some believe that is the little lady that they took and brought into David when we was an old man and dying to keep him warm (1 Kings 1:1-4)

NOTE: According to many historians, Solomon&rsquo;s women could have just as well numbered seven wives and three concubines.

> I Kings 11:3&amp;mdash; And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

King Solomon has the privilege to seduce any young maiden that he desires by his riches, by his success by his position as king, and he has chosen to seduce her. Solomon could not attract the attention of this maiden away from the shepherd 

> I Peter 2:25 &mdash; For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

Solomon, a man positioned as king, was what drew the attention of Israel away from God. They needed to have a singleness of eye for the Lord. Acts 2:46; Ephesians 6:5;Ephesians 6:5; Colossians 3:22; 1 Samuel 8:5-9; Hosea 13:11; Psalm 106:15

Solomon was a very wealthy king. 1 Kings 10:14; 2 Chronicles 9:13; Revelation 13:18

<center><b>Yet all the material wealth does not appeal to the young maiden.</b></center>

Solomon as the king reigning on the throne with all of his riches and finery of life in the **background**  of the story speaks of the world and all it&rsquo;s riches making it&rsquo;s appeal for the soul, drawing, attracting and seducing.

The shepherd boy speaks of the One that is the Shepherd of the soul. The Shephered offers not the trinkets of the world, but himself.**Only in Jesus can we be totally satisfied.** 

She has a satisfied dissatisfied feeling. She had just enough to want more. She has been near him but not near enough to satisfy her.

In this study we are not speaking of earthly things, but of Heavenly things&mdash;of  Christ and His Bride.
  
The king&rsquo;s position in the spiritual aspect is used in relationship to the Bridegroom throughout the Song.
  
## II. This is a Song
  
- <i>Song of Songs</i> Song of Solomon is five songs compiled into one.
  
> I Kings 4:32 &mdash; And he spake three thousand proverbs: and </span><span >his songs were a thousand and five
			
- Out the thousand and five we have but five. All the things that the LORD has wanted us to have have been preserved in the Bible. There is nothing lost that He wanted us to have, nor is there anything in the Bible that He didn&rsquo;t want us to have.
			
### 1. The Author of the Song
  
> &ldquo;The Song of Songs which is Solomon&rsquo;s&rdquo;
				
#### a. The Heavenly Solomon

- The earthly Solomon is the writer but not the author.
- The name Solomon means Peaceful or Prince of Peace.
- Solomon typifies the peaceful reign of Jesus in His millennial reign.

> I Chronicles 28:3 &mdash;  But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood
  
> I Chronicles 22:9 &mdash; Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
  
David is a type of the Son that fought the great battle overthrowing the enemy.
Solomon is a type of His returning as a ruling King reigning in peace.
  
> Revelation 20:2-7 &mdash; And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,

> Isaiah 2:4 &mdash; And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 

> Micah 4:3 &mdash; And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
  
> Hosea 2:18 &mdash; And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.
  
- Jesus is the Prince of Peace because He gives us peace.
- He has made a covenant with us also </span></p><p ><span >and it cannot and will not be broken
  
> Matthew 24:35 &mdash; Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

> Mark 13:31 &mdash; Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
  
> Luke 21:33 &mdash; Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

> Isaiah 9:6 &mdash; For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 
  
- We are talking about the One that has authored this book rather than the writer.
- The Song of songs by the Heavenly Solomon expressing His feeling toward the little maiden and the expressions of that maiden&rsquo;s feelings toward Him.</span></li></ul>
- The intent of this song reaches beyond the human comprehension. It is not vulgar, but is **beautiful**

### 3. The Ineffable Song
  
#### a. Un-Comprehensive Song &mdash; The carnal mind cannot understand it.

1. It takes Revelation of the Spirit of God
2. It takes Illumination of the Spirit of God
3. It takes Inspiration of the Spirit of God

> II Timothy 3:16 &mdash; All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
				
#### b. Unspeakable Song
	
<p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >&ldquo;Joy unspeakable and full of glory.&rdquo; [song]</span></p><p ><span >	.</span></p><p ><span >I Kings 10:7 </span></p><p ><span >Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >Ephesians 2:7 </span></p><p ><span >That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

<p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >Isaiah 6:1</span></p><p ><span >In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple</span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >Colossians 1:18 </span></p><p ><span >And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</span></p><p ><span >  </span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			
## III. A Song of Love

<p ><span >This is a Love Song of Christ and His Bride </span></p><p >
<!-- minute 35 on recording here --!>

- Divine      The Bridegroom is Jesus and He is expressing Himself.
- Maiden     The Bride is in love with Jesus and His Word and she responds with true expressions.
			
1. A Love Song--(deep expression- true love-real love)</span></li></ol>
<p ><span >The words of the Bridegroom are revealed by the Spirit.</span></p><p 

2. The response of the young maiden: 

	- Let **Him** Kiss me 

> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth:

The Bride never mentions the name of the Bridegroom but describes Him as **O thou whom my soul loveth** Her Beloved and the King 

"Let Him" She has a singleness of eye.
 
kiss- The seal of a Close Relationship single eye- can&rsquo;t see any one else</span></p><p ><span >     	True Love has a single eye- she is totally separated from the world</span></p><p ><span > Vs.2 &ldquo; Let him&rdquo;</span></p><p ><span >       1:2 &ldquo;for thy love&rdquo;</span></p><p ><span >       1:7 &ldquo;Whom my soul loveth&rdquo; </span><span >embraced by only Him</span></p><p ><span >      </span><span 

She has one love and there is no other that has her attention. </span></p><p ><span >   

She is totally committed to Him.

Note: He will not embrace you while you embrace the world. God is a jealous God and He wants you for Himself.

Talk about the one you love
God is looking for an expression from her that He is it.
The first-The last-and He is the only one.

	- Let Him kiss **me**

Her lover is absent and she has an inner longing for Him
The great love of the maiden and the expression of her desire.
- The cry of the soul:
- Oh to be in His presence
- To be near Him
- To feel His embrace in your soul
- Though Jesus is absent from us yet He is near at hand

<p ><span >Ps. 110:1; Acts 2:33; 7:55-56; Eph. 1:20; Col.3:1</span></p><p ><span >Mark 16 </span></p><p ><span > 19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the </span><span >right hand</span><span > of God.</span></p><p ><span > Hebrews 1 </span></p><p ><span > 3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the </span><span >right hand</span><span > of the Majesty on high;</span></p><p ><span > Hebrews 8 </span></p><p ><span > 1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the </span><span >right hand</span><span > of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</span></p><p ><span >Hebrews 10 </span></p><p ><span > 12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the </span><span >right hand</span><span > of God;</span></p><p ><span > Hebrews 12 </span></p><p ><span > 2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the </span><span >right hand</span><span > of the throne of God. </span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >The touch of His presence totally satisfies our needs.</span></p><p ><span >     Burdens?          Trial?</span></p><p ><span >     Pressure?          Torment?</span></p><p ><span >     Problems?</span></p><p ><span >He kisses away all our troubles and our problems.</span></p><p ><span >Get closer to Him.</span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >     

	- The kisses of His mouth

a. Let Him **kiss  me** 

The love, in the song of her lover, expressed to her, in the fact that she so desired His kisses.

> Psalms 2 &mdash; 12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

Do you know what the kisses mean in the bible?

1. **The kiss of Reconciliation**. Those that were separated from their family setting, when they came back they received a kiss and restores us into fellowship.</span></p><p ><span >2 Samuel 14 </span></p><p ><span > 33 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king </span><span >kissed </span><span >Absalom.</span></p><p ><span >Lu 15:20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and </span><span >kissed</span><span > him. </span></p><p ><span >Lu 15:24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. 

2. **Kiss of Acceptance**. He accepts us as we accept Him.

3. **Kiss of an Expression of Real Love**. The Spirit of God touching our lives, the Graces of God being made manifest in our hearts.

>Song 1:2 &para; Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth:

The expression of real love, real intimate feelings. Living and moving with Him in the Spirit.- a relm most do not understand.
 
Demands a close relationship to Him. To receive the kisses of the Lord you have got to be close. Nothing demands our attention as much as Jesus.

> Re 2:4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.

An expression among foreigners ---to kiss their own hand.

IT&rsquo;S NOT THE BRIDE IT IS THE BRIDEGROOM

## IV. The Song of Deep Love

> Song 1:2 &para; Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: --- for thy love is better than< wine .

### 1. The Tokens of His love --- better than wine</span></p><p ><span > The Wine is a Type of prosperity and of all desirable things </span></p><ol start="1" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			
<li ><span >The many things that He shares	</span></li>
<li ><span >The many things that He gives.</span></li></ol>
		<p ><span >Php 4:19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</span></p><p ><span >            </span></p><ol start="2" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			
### 2. The expression reveals the Excellence of His Love.

<p ><span >In wine we have the expression of </span><span >joy </span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >Acts 2:18</span></p><p ><span >Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. </span></p><p ><span >	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</span></p><p ><span >For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.</span></p><p ><span >But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</span></p><p ><span > 	And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</span></p><p ><span >And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span > </span><span >Eph 5:18 </span></p><p ><span >And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >         a. </span><span >His love brings</span><span > Joy   </span></p><p ><span >    His love cheers us.</span></p><p ><span >    His love strengthens us for coming trials and as His Bride.</span></p><p ><span >     His love excels all Joy.</span></p><p ><span > Ne 8:10 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.</span></p><p ><span >        b. His love brings </span><span >Pleasure</span></p><p ><span >Ps 16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</span></p><ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			
<li ><span >His love brings </span><span >Strength.</span></li></ol>
		<ol start="3" style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">
			
### 3. The Purpose of His Love

It is necessary for us to have His love that we may Express real love.
 
> 1Jo 4:19 We love him, because he first loved us

>John 14:21,23 &mdash; He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

**THIS IS NOT A NATURAL EXPERIENCE** A TIME IN THE SPIRIT WHERE FOOD LOOSES IT&rsquo;S ATTRACTION AND TIME IS LOST.

The Bride is calling out to Him, but He is calling out to her. She is not where she should be, and He is drawing and calling her. He is making overtures to her. Let us get our cup filled not with wine, but with His love.

>Matthew 5:6	 They that </span><span >hunger and thirst</span><span >&hellip; [a </span><span >craving</span><span > in our heart]

> Psalms 42:1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.

The Bride is going to thirst after Him. She is not going to thirst after all the things He could give, but </span><span >Him</span><span >&mdash;</span><span >His love, His presence</span><span >&mdash;are better than wine. </span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >God wants to manifest Himself in us and through us in a measure that this old world has never seen before.</span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >How much of His presence do you have? </span></p><p ><span >If you have enough to be satisfied than you do not have enough&mdash;WE NEED MORE.</span></p><p ><span > </span></p><p ><span >Is all that we have a &lsquo;church affair&rsquo;?</span></p><p ><span >Are we only satisfying the natural and glorifying the flesh and not glorifying God?

## Conclusion: DRAW NEAR TO HIM

Let Him develop His love in our hearts so that we can really love Him the way we ought to love Him.
