> Song of Solomon 1:1 &mdash; The song of songs, which is Solomon's

## INTRODUCTION TO THE SONG OF SOLOMON

### Read the Song of Solomon

Song of Solomon cannot be approached with natural understanding because the Song of Solomon is a spiritual book. If you read the Song of Solomon from the natural view, you are going to have mixed emotions. You will have very strange opinions. This has happened before, but I trust that before you form any deep opinions that you would listen to the Bible lessons and put all the pieces together before you pass judgment. If you hear only a part of a conversation, then you could get a total different picture or impression of what was meant then if you had heard the whole conversation. Am I right?

It would be well for you to read the Song of Solomon before you continue with this study. There are only eight very short chapters; it is not a very long book. You could probably read the whole book in less than forty-five minutes. This will provide you with at least a surface understanding of the book. You will not understand all that is there after the first time you read it. A lot of people in their whole lifetime do not ever attempt to understand the Song of Solomon. They know it is in the Bible and that is pretty much it, and some I think are even ashamed it is in the Bible. The Song of Solomon is not something to be ashamed of; it is a beautiful book when rightly interpreted and understood.

> Song of Solomon 1:1-7 &mdash; The song of songs, which is Solomon's.  2 ¶ Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.  3 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.  4 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.  5 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
 6 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept. 7 ¶ Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
 
I am going to simply give you an introduction to the book of Song of Solomon, and give you some background and foundational material in relation to the Song. I am doing this to get you ready for the exegesis over the text itself. We will spend quite amount of time with the exposition of this book. We will without question be months on this study. That might scare you. &quot;Oh, I am going to be listening to the Song of Solomon for months?&quot; I am sure if the Holy Spirit will grant this teacher and preacher His anointing, when we get to the end of the book you will be sad and say, &quot;Oh, I wish there was more.&quot; Now, if it is left up to me alone, you will wish before tonight is over that we were not going into the book of Song of Solomon.

Before you begin to study this book, and or listen to these messages and or study these notes read the book in it&apos;s entirety at least three times, in order to gain a surface understanding of this wonderful book called the Song
of Solomon

### The Language of this Book

Many Christians live their entire lives without reading Song of Solomon. They know it is in the Bible, but they appear to be ashamed of its presence. It is a beautiful book and nothing to be ashamed of rightly interpreted and rightly understood.

Some Bible scholars believe that this book does not belong in the Canon of the Bible, and many do not believe that the Song of Solomon is an inspired book. All they see is a demonstration of a love affair&mdash;an earthly feeling between a woman and her lover.

I am believing that the Holy Spirit has heard prayer and is this includes Bible scholars, Bible interpreters, some commentators, and those that have a made a deep study of the Bible but not really having a deep understanding of the Word of God, do not feel that the book of Solomon even belongs in the canon of the Bible. There are a lot of people that do not believe that this book was an inspired book, and it ought to have no place in the Holy Word of God. The reason why is that it appears to them as nothing more than a demonstration of a love affair&mdash;nothing more than feelings between a woman and her lover. Because they feel it is nothing more than a
story talking of earthly love, they totally miss the purpose of it; therefore, they say it should not be in the Bible. 

The reason why I say all of this is to prepare you for some of the expressions that
are found in the Song of Solomon. 

This is not an account of earthly feelings or expressions, but a relationship that is Heavenly and Holy and not as a story of the natural. Prepare yourself for some expressions that are found in this book. Again these expressions are not of the carnal nature or of &quot;Earthly Expressions,&quot; but in the Holy of Holies, beyond the Outer Court, beyond the Inner Court beyond the Holy place, beyond the Veil in the Most Holy Place, here Christ is manifesting His divine affection for you not as an earthly thing but Holy and Heavenly.

This is a beautiful book; it is a spiritual book. 

### We Need the Whole Loaf

Of course we could say many things in relation to that, but the whole Bible itself is under attack in our day. The devil is very subtle. He&apos;s pretty much honeycombed the whole book. Ever see a piece of timber that looked like it had all of it shaped but if you ever put your foot on it it was all eaten out? It was deteriorated yet still holding its form. This is what has happened in many places to the Word of God. 

They have just , its all honeycombed, they have taken out this and they have taken out that set this aside and set that aside until you wonder what is left?

But you know how much God has left behind for us saints? He preserved for us the <b>whole</b> loaf. It is all God&apos;s Word, even the Song of Songs. It is is God&apos;s Word and it has got life.

We cannot afford to take out or edit any of the Scripture just because the language becomes difficult to understand. We should embrace the whole Word of God and through prayer, study and the ministry of the Holy Ghost endeavor to understand it.

### God Desires a Close Relationship with You

This is not an account of earthly feelings or expressions, but a relationship that is Heavenly and Holy. This book is not a story of the natural but the the spiritual. With that in mind, prepare yourself for some expressions that are found in this book. Again, these expressions are not to be interpreted in a carnal context, but in a spiritual and holy context. In this book, Christ is manifesting His divine affection for you.

#### Spend Time with Him

Let me just share this with you if I can. If you love somebody, what is the most important thing if you really somebody? Yes, we do that we show that, but really the reason why we even do things for the one we love is because we want to see their reaction. WE love them so much, we do things for them because we love them, but the whole thing we just love to be with them. If you love somebody you just want to be with them. You can take a stick and beat them away and then they come back. 

I can remember when I was as just a little fellow, I could not say it was love, cause I do not know if little fellows know what love is all about, but I sure had a whole lot of feeling. A little girl lived up on the hill and I used to ride my bicycle in pouring down rain and I knew before I left my house that her momma or daddy would not let her go out of the house and they were not going to in any way let me in, but I would ride that bicycle I think it was over three miles many times in right pouring down rain just to ride by the house hoping I could see her and then turn around and ride all the way back home&mdash;puppy love. I was a just a little fellow and I thought my feelings, my feelings were involved. You can&apos;t get involved like that and not ride a bicycle in the pouring down rain. I tried in the winter, and I even tried to ride a bicycle on the slippery ground, and there was a neighbor next door. I use to go down and I didn&apos;t really care for that kid he was kind of &quot;soft&quot;, but I used to go down there and play with him because it was right across the street from her and once in a while her dad would let her come over. I would spend hours waiting to see her. 

To give you an understanding of what I am trying to stay. God loves you. Did you hear what I said? God loves you. Is He just interested in doing something for you? He wants to be with you. He loves you. And there is only one thing that can stop him from being with you and do you know what that is? Self. The devil cannot stop Him. &quot;Devil, get out of the way or I&apos;ll run right over you!&quot; 

You will find all through this book God making advances to be with the one he loves. And you will find in the book revelations of our attitude towards his advances. 

- &quot;Well, I&apos;m a quite busy right now; he can wait a little while.&quot; 
- Or &quot;I&apos;m a little bit drowsy.&quot; 
- In one place she says, &quot;I have already put off my coat and I am not going to get up now,&quot;

But, when she finally made up her mind that she was going to get up and go he had decided he had already waited long enough. Just because he loves us does not mean he is always going to wait. No, he wants to feelings to be mutual. Did you ever try to love somebody that didn&apos;t love you? I do not know if you could call it love, but, again, I had a lot of feelings for someone and man they would not pay any attention to me. Finally I got disgusted and the more I took on that attitude they
chased me around like a little puppy dog and I didn&apos;t&apos; want them. My feelings had changed. **Let us not let his feelings change towards because were are occupied too busy.**

#### Share with Him

Somethings a loving husband and wife share with each other, are not shared with anyone else. God has some great things He wants to share with us, but we have to get close enough so He can share them with us.

He desires to share divine secrets in the Spirit with those He truly Loves! John 15:15

#### Love Him Our Best

He loves us, but how is our love for Him? We want to love Him with ALL, but if we are honest we often do hold reservations. What could be more important than having time for the Lord?

The Lord Jesus Christ wants us as His people to Love Him with out any reservation. (Matthew 22:37; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27; Deuteronomy 6:5; Deuteronomy 10:12; Deuteronomy 13:3; Deuteronomy 30:6)

You don't have to be a monk or nun in order to love Him. You can be in fellowship with Him while you are busy. But if you are too busy to fellowship with Him, that is when we get in trouble. 

The Lord really Loves you. We cannot fully comprehend how much God loves us. You are Spiritually desired and loved more than you can comprehend. (1 John 3:16; 1 John 4:9-10)

#### Love Him Exclusively

You must know that the Lord loves you if you are going to understand this book. No one will Love you any more than Jesus Does

God does not want the world to play around with you, nor you to play around with the world. We often get bit by the devil only because we have been fooling around with things a child of God should never touch. God is jealous for His people.

### Review 



Don&apos;t allow the Devil to honeycomb your understanding of the bible.

Do you fully understand how much God wants and desires you?

> Ephesians 1:3 &mdash; Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:

**Spiritual Blessings in High Places**

If you truly love someone, the most important thing that you can do is spend time with them. We must be making every effort to spend time with the Lord. God
makes many advances toward the one He loves in this book.

(Stay close to Jesus in the Spirit and He will help you keep your garment clean)

**The Lord wants to express Himself to you!***

He wants to Love you like you have never been loved before!

**He desires to share divine secrets in the Spirit with those He truly Loves!

> John 15:15 &mdash; Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things
that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you

The Lord Jesus Christ wants us as His people to Love Him with out any reservation at all for ourselves.

- With All Our Heart
- With All Our Soul
- With All Our Mind
- With All Our Strength

Matt. 22:37 Mk, 12:30, Lk. 10:27, Deut. 6:5, 10:12, 13:3, 30:6

<u><b>We are to be in fellowship with Him and one with another but never with
worldiness.</b></u>

Christ our Lord.
  
> 1 John 1:3 &mdash; That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye
also may have <b>fellowship</b> with us: and truly our <b>fellowship</b> is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
 
> 1 John 1:7 &mdash; But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have <b>fellowship </b> one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
  
> 2 Corinthians 8:4 &mdash; Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the <b>fellowship</b> of the ministering to the saints.

> Eph 3:9 &mdash; And to make all men see what is the <b>fellowship</b> of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:

**The Lord really Loves you. &mdash; You are Spiritually desired**

God truly loves us more than we can comprehend.
  
> 1 John 3:16 &mdash; Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

> 1 John 4:9 &mdash; In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 
  
> 1 John 4:10 &mdash; Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins. 

God does not want the world to play around with you, nor you to play around with the world.

the LORD thy God am a <b>jealous</b> God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

> Nahum 1:2 God is <b>jealous</b>, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.
  
> Song 8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; <b>jealousy</b> is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.

You must know that the Lord loves you if you are going to understand this book.

<i><b>No one will Love you any more than Jesus Does</b></i>

### There are three general lines of thought here in the Book.

1. The Relationship of Jehovah with Israel
2. The Relationship of Christ with His Church
3. The Relationship of Christ with His Bride
  
#### 1. The Relationship of Jehovah with Israel &mdash; God's chosen people

  Some believe that this book is entirely an allegory that sets forth God's choice and guidance of Israel. This book is a revelation God's choice for Israel as a nation, God's guidance of Israel out of Egypt, God's providence over Israel in the wilderness and God's placing of them in the Land of Canaan awaiting the Messiah.

There is a definite parallel with this book and the history of the Jews, but that is because Israel itself is a type. All God's dealings with Israel are typical and are given for our example and instruction. <a href="/bible/search?q=Romans 15:4" target="_BLANK">Romans 15:4</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=1 Corinthians 10:11" target="_BLANK">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Hebrews 8:5" target="_BLANK">Hebrews 8:5</a>

God loves Israel, but God does not love ONLY Israel. God's people are not born of natural Abraham, but they are born of spiritual Abraham&mdash;i.e., by faith. <a href="/bible/search?q=Romans 9:8" target="_BLANK">Romans 9:8</a>

As an overall view there is a likeness here. Israel is a type where you can find God dealing with His people
  
> Romans 15:4 &mdash; For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
  
> 1 Corinthians 10:11 &mdash; Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 

> Hebrews 8:5 &mdash; Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as 
 Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, <i>that</i> thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. 

#### 2. The relationship of Christ with His Church
  
This is probably the most popular opinion regarding this book. Most believe this book concerns a relationship with Christ and His Church. On the premise, the beginning of the Song coincides with the time just after the birth of Christ and its end relates to the end of the time of the Gentiles. The church is now in a state of waiting for the Lord to come back to meet his Church/Bride.

I believe there are too many discrepancies created when we try to make the entire Body of the Church to be the Bride of Christ. This leads us to the third line of thought and the main one which we will follow in our study.
  
#### 3. The relationship of Christ with His Bride

Is the Church and the Bride the same thing? Is there a difference between the Church and the Bride? What is the difference?

The Church is the Body of Christ and the Bride is only a part of that Body. The Bride is a fragment of the Church, like the rib that was taken out of Adam&apos;s side). 
The Bride will be taken out of the great Body of the Church. <a href="/bible/search?q=Acts 15:14" target="_BLANK">Acts 15:14</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Genesis 5:24" target="_BLANK">Genesis 5:24</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Luke 12:35-38" target="_BLANK">Luke 12:35-38</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=1 Thessalonians 3:13" target="_BLANK">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Matthew 25:1-13" target="_BLANK">Matthew 25:1-13</a>; <a href="/bible/search?q=Revelation 19:9" target="_BLANK">Revelation 19:9</a>

> Genesis 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
  
> Act 15:14 &mdash; Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
  
> Ge 5:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
  
> Luke 12 35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; 36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will <u><b>return from the wedding</b></u>; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately. 37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. 38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.
  
> 1 Thessalonians 3 13 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ <u><b>with
all his saints. </b></u>
  
> Matthew 25:1 &mash; 1 Then shall the kingdom of
heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went
forth to meet the bridegroom.
  
> Matthew 25:6 &mdash; And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.

> Matthew 25:10 &mdash; And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: (marriage feast) and the door was shut.

> Revelation 19:9 &mdash; And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.
