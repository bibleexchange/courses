Song of Solomon chapter 3, beginning to read from verse one. We are
going to read the first six verses. Song of Solomon 3:1-6:</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Song

Verse is what we are mostly concerned with for this lesson:</p>

perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Now we have not gone into a lengthy discussion here on verse five
because we've pretty well covered that in verse seven of chapter 2
and you notice it is the same thing being said in chapter 2 verse
seven that says&hellip; 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Although there is the same wording being used, the same thought is
not expressed. I do not feel that it is necessary to go into a long
thing to explain that to you. So, just a few comments and then we'll
get into the lesson for tonight</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
In chapter 2 she is telling the daughters of Jerusalem those that
were round about her not to stir him up because of her own personal
needs and wants and desires. She was seeking for something for
herself and she did not them to stir him up or to frighten him off.
That there will be nothing that would offend him and drive him away
from her. &quot;stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.&quot; 
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
But here in 3:5 the thought is not in relationship to her, but in
relationship to her mother&apos;s house and to her family and to those
that were around her. I am sure as you see the application. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The further we go on with the Lord and the closer that we get to him
the more we are concerned not just with our self but with others. And
there is a great concern in the heart of the little bride for those
that are not as fortunate to know and to understand and to
comprehend. It is sad when you know that truth is being related and
people can&apos;t even grasp it. Not that they are not hearing truth,
but can't grasp truth. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
So her cry is don't stir him, don't offend him in any way that He
would leave. Give ample opportunity to everyone to hear and to
respond. So this is her cry. She is much concerned with those that
are around about her. And I've said this many times, I believe that
the bride is going to have a vision for souls and for the church. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Although the church doesn't have a vision of the bride the bride
should have a vision of the church. Have compassion, have love, have
something in their soul. Because if we have something to share we
should want to share it. We have something that is worthwhile. It is
worth sharing, it is worth having. No price is too great to have it;
no price is too great to keep it.</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Don&apos;t stir him up don&apos;t offend him, give them opportunity until
they heard and heard well and had opportunity to respond.</p>

&quot;The Bridegroom Reflected&quot;</p>

<b>verse 6</b>, &quot;<i>Who is this that cometh out of the

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The bridegroom reflected or the bridegroom's reflection. Reflected
glare? Reflected in some places. As you see the overall truth
relationship to the Scripture you'll see that he is speaking
definitely of Israel. But there is also a reflection of that Israel
in the lives of others. We see a reflection of the bridegroom and the
life of the bride. The life of the bridegroom is reflected in the
Scripture speaks about us as being imitators of who? Christ. And we
are change from glory to glory into the same image. What image? What
image or we been changed into? Into Christ's image. As we both hold
him and we were flat as the moon reflects the light of the sun the
bride reflects the light of the bridegroom. And the lesson we are
dealing with the reflection of the bridegroom and the bride. First we
see it in relationship to temptation.</p>

</ol>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
This question is not answered directly but is answered by inference.
Who is this? How many times was that very question asked of Jesus?
&quot;Who art thou?&quot; Over and over again was Jesus asked. Even
at the very end as Jesus did before Pilate and Pilate asks him, &quot;Who
art thou?&quot; Who are you? Are you the son of God? Are you the king
of Israel?</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
In these verses they are talking about Jesus but also they are
talking about that reflection which is seen in the bride.

	the bride	-	&quot;Who is this?&quot;</p>
</ol>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Can you remember when the bride first came out of Jerusalem they had
a lot to say about her--she was black, she was not beautiful, she was
not well accepted, she was totally rejected. But now, they are
mystified by her and are saying, &quot;Who is this?&quot;</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
 Will the church ever come to the place where she will recognize who
the little bride is? Oh yes, but it will be too late. You notice she
is coming out of the wilderness. She will not be coming out of the
wilderness until he calls her. But there will come a time when the
little bride she escapes all these things and then their eyes to be
opened and they'll say, &quot;Who is this? I thought she was
uncomely. I thought she was black. I thought that she was the outcast
and the off scouring of the world.&quot; But when she comes out of
the wilderness, they will stand mystified by her.</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
It is a beautiful thing to see God's plan of God's purpose working
out. Sometimes all we can see is the present and God tries to get us
to look beyond the present. The present is not always all that
glorious. The present yields us all kinds of sorrows and rejections
and sufferings and afterwards yield yields something else. What do
these things yield afterwards? The peaceable fruit of righteousness.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<b>Hebrews 12:11</b>&mdash;<i>Now no chastening for the present seemeth
to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised</i>
thereby.</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Now we all want the peaceable fruit of righteousness, but are we
willing to pay the price? For the little bride is reflected is
reflecting that which her bridegroom has already gone through. He is
already traversed this way prior. And the question naturally is
answered in the life of Jesus but is also answered in the life of the
little bride. She will follow in his footsteps. How many of you
understand that the footsteps of Jesus do not lead to a throne in
this life? Where do they lead? They lead to a cross outside of the
city. Still want to follow him? Still want the best that he has to
offer to you? And as the gallant will begin to see some of these
impurities to work on of our lives because of that. This is what God
is after. God is after something glorious in us. And to put something
glorious in us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Now
we see that the answer comes back to that which is inferred in the
text it is the Lord and also it is the bride reflecting all that he
was in all that he went through. Now the second thing:</p>

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Now, our armies have totally changed in these last few years, but a
few years ago back in the old time a captain was a man that led his
army. He did not sit in the back and give orders but he led them.
Even generals themselves would go out into the field of battle and
lead them. And Christ as our captain, he is leading us he is not just
sending us. He is leading us. &quot;And the captain of our salvation
was made perfect through sufferings.&quot;</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Who is this that comes up out of the wilderness? When you see him in
Bethlehem, when you see them round about Jordan in Jerusalem, there
is no beauty that you would think that he was anything but was a
normal man. The Scripture speaks of him like a root.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: -0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<b>Isa 53:1-2</b>&mdash;<i>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is
the arm of the LORD revealed? 2 For he shall grow up before him as a
tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor
comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we
should desire him.3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of
sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces
from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</i></p>

<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Because of Isaiah's expressions here many have taken these verses to
mean that Jesus was very ugly and homely. I do not believe that Jesus
was ugly or homely. I believe that he was a man. A handsome man. When
Isaiah says, &quot;there is no beauty that we should desire him&quot;
he is describing a time of great stress and struggle when Christ was
rejected by men and scorched by men. When man was finished
brutalizing Christ there is nothing beautiful about him. He was
totally a substitute for us. But as far as him and his natural life,
I believe he was handsome man, but there is nothing indicative of
Christ being outstanding physically speaking.</p>

And he did not come to reign on the throne but he came to die in a
cross. He came into the training ground. &quot;Who is this that
cometh up&hellip;&quot; where? Where is he coming out of? The wilderness! 
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
We see Jesus passing the early parts of his life around Nazareth. He
is known as the Nazarene and he is known as a carpenter's son. And we
see him in this area in the early part of his life and he does not
travel much but stays in that area until he is about 30 years of age.
And then he entered into his public ministry, the Bible says he went
to John being about 30 years of age, down into the regions of
Beth-abara and Jordan and he was baptized by John. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
When Jesus came up out of the waters of baptism something happened.
Now the Bible says that the spirit rested upon him like a dove. But
something further than that, it says that he was led by the Spirit
away to a specific place. Where was he led away by the spirit? Into
the wilderness! We like the Lord to lead us out of the wilderness.
But it is the wilderness that is the training ground. You are not
going to get to the throne and a rocking chair. You are not going to
reign with him in a place of power and glory through luxury and
through the finery's of life. That does not mean that you cannot have
them, but you'll never arranged because of them. You will reign
because you have been in the wilderness!

We see him in that specific experience at 30 years of age going into
the wilderness but in reality Jesus is already in the wilderness. His
whole life was like a wilderness. Rejected, scoffed, mocked, falsely
accused; isn't that a wilderness? It wasn't just those 40 days that
he was tempted and tested the devil himself came to him asking him if
he was the son of God but he was constantly being tested and tried
was in the wilderness all of his life time.

But as he comes to the closing of his life, we find him in a garden,
but in reality it was a wilderness -- the greatest trauma and test
that he ever faced. He was in agony of spirit. He groaned in the
spirit.

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Have you ever grown because of the pressure? Have you ever agonize
because you could inform syllables and you just groaned? Jesus was
not groaning for himself, he was groaning for the condition of the
world. Luke says that he being in agony, prayed more earnestly until
his sweat was as great drops of blood. That was a wilderness.</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
The final chapter, it appeared was in place, everything arranged as
it was supposed to be, then all of a sudden we see one burst forth
out of the wilderness triumphantly! The birds are singing, the sun is
shining, and all of heaven seems to be ringing -- &quot;Who is this
coming up out of the wilderness?&quot; Jesus divested hell of all its
power and glory (if there is any glory to it). He divested hell of
the keys of death and hell. He has the keys of death and hell at his
side. He triumphs over the wilderness. 
</p>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Who is this coming out? It wasn't a mystery because he was like a man
coming out of battle crawling on his hands and knees barely escaping
the battle. Oftentimes it's how we come out of a battle, we come out
on her hands and knees and someone could look at us all worn and say,
&quot;Who is this?&quot; We did not make it through, we escaped from
it!

<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

himself! He bruised him and pulverized him and he has been staggering

God is so particular in his arrangement of everything that if he
wanted us to know that we were going to be perfected over there He
would've said so. But she is coming up out of the wilderness with all
of the glory of her bridegroom. We are in the wilderness, where in
the training graphs, or in the bouquet, we have been put on the
obstacle course. We are in a process. We might not understand the
process, but we understand the principle. God is trying to work out
something in our lives. We see only just so far. We can see just as
the sun comes up of God wants us to see beyond the sunrise and see
his eternal program in his eternal plan. That God has something for
us that is far greater than this present world. God is not spending
his energy to fit in fashion you just have you lived in this life but
God is fashioning you to be a vessel unto honor for eternity for
glory on to him. Who is this coming up out of the wilderness? &quot;I
cannot understand!&quot; Then get beyond it and see the final product
that God has in mind. No Temptation presently is glorious, but it
produces something that is glorious. God is after something is in our
life.</p>
