There is a demand on the Believer to DO something! She not only told Him that she loved Him, but He is ensnared by her dedication. Through the tests, hard times and trials she has SHOWED Him that she loves Him.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;&ldquo;Words are cheap&rdquo; but actions are priceless.

Here they are totally committed verbally, but when they get out in everyday life complaints come out &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this was part of the bargain.&rdquo; There certainly couldn&rsquo;t have been too much real love in the verbal sentiment.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">They say that &ldquo;Home is where the heart is.&rdquo; Heaven is our home and should be where our heart is!

When they rode in the car they didn&rsquo;t sit on opposite sides of the car but both squeezed in one side. He would leave her to go to work and call her when he got there and call her several times every day. He would come home, pick her up and they would get the groceries together. The relationship they shared was close and intimate and this is the kind of love between Christ and His Bride. He is ravished (ensnared, caught) by her love!</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">This Bride relationship is not shared by Church because the Church has too many other interests. </span><span class="csDA02FF29">To the Bride, He is number one.

Jesus is not interested in just pouring it on over and over with no return. He is looking for something. It is not difficult to give back if you get plenty to begin with. The problem is we have so much of the world and so little of him that we are dried up and we wonder why we can&rsquo;t love him. The only way we can love Him is if we let Him love us! Soak it in and then you have something to give Him in return. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">She was totally separated to Him. There has been a transformation in her since she started out running after Him. She described herself in the beginning as black as the tents of Kedar and smelling like a goat. But now she is smelling like a lily and the rose of Sharon. How do you lose the goat smell? Hang around the goat pen? No! Get out amongst the lilies and the roses. Lay in his presence. </span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs31AF52D0"><span class="csA7555675">2 Corinthians 6:17,18&mdash;</span><span class="csD5FB87F7">Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,</span><span class="csA7555675"> 18</span><span class="csD5FB87F7"> And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">He has been looking for one that smells like the lilies like Him. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">ILLUSTRATION: Go visit a group of guys working hard, sweating and getting dirty.

Association. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">We won&rsquo;t smell too bad if we get close to Him. But when we get away from Him we will start to smell. If we come into the house of God and wonder why God isn&rsquo;t blessing, or speaking, maybe it is because we smell too much like the world. </span></p><p class="csF8CBA3A1"><span class="csA7555675">She has separated herself from everyone except Him and to Him she smells good.
