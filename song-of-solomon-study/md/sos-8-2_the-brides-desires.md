# The Bride's Desires

> Song of Solomon 8:2 &mdash; I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.

## I. The Desire to Help Others

> I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house ...

### A. She Sees the Need

She sees the shallowness and lukewarmness of the church. 

> Revelation 3:16 &mdash; So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.

What is lukewarmness?

- Revelation 3:15, The Lord wishes we were cold or hot.
- Complacent, comfortable with the spiritual climate, v. 17 "Have need of nothing"
- While the truth is there is MUCH NEEDED: wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked: -- REPENT
- that halts between two opinions,
- I will] Rather, I shall soon, or, I am likely to â€¦: the word used does not necessarily imply that the intention is final -- vomit 

### B. She Wants to Help

Not condemn, but she wants others to taste of the joys that are hers.

==================

## II. The Desire to be Instructed

> ... who would instruct me

- Only Jesus can instruct and guide us. 
- To be instructed by Him we need to walk with Him. 

We know "WHO" would instruct (JESUS), so we can ask further "HOW" would he instruct me?

1. By Precept - the Word, the Law

2. By Revelation - by the Spirit

Some think they can neverr know God's voice. Others think that every thought and imagination that comes is God. It is odd that these always get leadings and messages for others. (A mother dreams that you would marry her daughter.)

3. By Example - He teaches us by His own example

==================

## III. The Desire to be Wedded

> ... I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine ...

> Matthew 26:29 &mdash; But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

two cups:

### 1. The Cup of Calvar - Salvation

### 2. The Cup of Union - Marriage

==================
## IV. The Desire to Please Him

>  ... of the juice of my pomegranate.

### 1. Her Humility - "pomegranate"

### 2. The Process of Humility

Notice the word "juice". It comes from a root meaning "to trample, squeeze, bruise." This describes the process of extracting the juice.

### 3. The Fruit of Humility

- There is Natural Pride
- There is Wordly Pride
- There is Spiritual Pride

Pride is like the fiber and pulp. All the fiber and hard particles must be pressed out. No false, fleshly humility or Pride. Just the humility of the Spirit.

the Fruit of Humility.
