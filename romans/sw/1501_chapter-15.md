# Kufanya kazi kwa ajili ya umoja(sura 15) #Laboring for unity (chapter 15)

## Utangulizi ##Introduction

Waamini ni wakukaribishana wao kwa wao,kama Kristo alivyo wapokea mataifa kwa utukufu wa Mungu.Sehemu ya kwanza ya sura hii inaelezea mahusiano ya kikristo,Kristo akiwa kama mfano wao mkamilifu.Ujumbe binafsi wa Paulo kwa Warumi unaanza na katika msitari wa 14.Huduma ya Paulo ilikuwa kwa wote kwa wale waliokuwa ndani(wayahudi ambao makuu ya Mungu yalifanyika kwao na kwa wale ambao haikufanyika(wa mataifa).Kazi ya umoja kataika mwili wa Kristo ni kazi ya MUngu.Believers are to receive one another, as Christ received the gentiles—to God's glory. The first section of this chapter describes Christian relationships, with Christ as the perfect example of them. Paul's personal message to the Romans begins in Verse 14. Paul's ministry was to both those who were within (the Jews, those to whom were given the oracles of God) and to those who were without (the gentiles). The work of unity in the body of Christ is the work of God.

## Tufanye kazi ya kukaribishana pamoj an Kristo kama mfano wetu(mstr. 1–12) ##We are to labor in receiving another with Christ as our example (vs. 1–12)

### Kuna tofauti kadhaa(mwanzo wa kihsitoria) ##There are some differences (historical background)

Kuna tofauti nyingi za kidini na kimila kati ya wayahudi na wamataifa kwa kufunguliwa injili kwa mataifa kulikuwa na ugumu mwingi wa kushinda.Paulo anaonya kwa ushupavu,tunatakiwa kufanya kazi ili kuwapokea wamataifa kama Mungu alivyo wapokea.Kiwango cha juu na kutawala kwa kile ambacho tabia zetu hupimwa "kama kristo alivyo tupokea sisi kwenye utukufu wa Mungu"(mstr. 7).There are many cultural and religious differences between the Jews and gentiles and with the opening of the Gospel to the gentiles there were alot of hurdles to overcome. Paul admonishes the church adamantly, that we are to labor to receive the gentiles as God has already received them. The high standard and rule by which our conduct is measured is "as Christ also received us to the glory of God" (v. 7).

Kuwa myahudi kwa shaka,makanisa ya kwanza yange jisikia "kuwa ya kiyahudi"(michanganyiko ya mila na ushawishi) kulikuwa na ufukuzwaji kwa mara ya kwanza kutoka Roma kwa wayahudi wote na ni mageuzi ya kiasili na kimila yaliyo tokea katika makanisa ya kirumi.Mwishowe, wayahudi walirudi katika mji wa Roma kupata vitu tofauti zaidi ya walivyokuwa wameacha.Ilikuepuka mgawanyiko,Kanisa la kwanza lilikuwa linafanya kazi kwa pamoja ilikushinda tofauti zao za kimila kwa kujifunza vile vitu ambavyo vinahitaji sana"(Matendo 15:28; Waefeso 4:3, 13).
 Being predominately Jewish, the early churches would feel "very Jewish" (a mixture of culture and conviction). There was an early expulsion from Rome of all Jews and it is only natural the cultural shift that took place in the Roman churches. Eventually, Jews began to return back to the city of Rome finding things different than when they had left. In order to not become divided, the early church had to labor together in overcoming their cultural differences by learning what things were "most needful" (Acts 15:28; Ephesians 4:3, 13).

### Kuna kanuni za kidunia ### There are universal principles

#### Wakristo waliitwa kuishi maisha ambayo sio ya kichoyo (mstr. 1–2)Christians are called to unselfish living (v. 1–2)

Warumi sura ya kumi tano inaongelea kuishi maisha yasiyo ya kichoyo.Wenye nguvu wanapaswa kuwasaidia wadhaifu.Tunapaswa kuishi sio kujipendeza wenyewe bali kumpendeza Mungu,kuwatanguliza wengine mbele yetu.Sura hii inaishia na safari za Paulo.Romans chapter fifteen talks about living an unselfish life. Those that are strong are to help the weak. We are to not live to please ourselves but to please God, to put others before us. This chapter ends with Paul's missionary journeys.

Sura ya kumi na tano ya Warumi inahisia nzito ya hitimisho.Kama ulivyo mtindo wa Paulo katika kitabu hiki,anarudia mawazo ambayo aliyawasilisha lakini ni kwa mwelekeo zaidi na kibinafsi.Anatoa maelezo ya maelekezo maelezo yaliyo fuata kwa wasomaji wake:The fifteenth chapter of Romans has a strong feeling of conclusion. As is Paul's style in this book, he repeats concepts already presented but more directly and personally. He prescribes the following instructions to his readers:

* Wenye nguvu wanapaswa kuchukuliana na wadhaifu.*The strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak.
* Kupendeza majirani zetu kwa wema wao na imani.*Please our neighbor to their good and edification.
* Kuchukuliana ni nia ya Kristo.Kwamba mwe na nia moja na kuwa na kauli moja ya kumtukuza Mungu.*Bearing toward another the mind of Christ. That ye may with ONE mind and ONE mouth glorify God.
* Yesu ni mhudumu kwa wayahudi na kwa wa mataifa.* Jesus is a minister to the Jew and Gentile.
* Wamataifa wanasababu ya kufurahi na wanaamriwa kufanya hivyo katika maandiko matakatifu.*The Gentiles have reason to rejoice and are commanded to do so in the Scripture.

#### Kristo ni mfano wa mkristo kwa ajili ya kuishi(mstr. 3) ###Christ is the Christian's example for living (v. 3)

Kwa nini mkristo ni lazima kuhusika na wengine badala yake mwenyewe?Tunapaswa kumtumia Kristo kama mfano wetu, "hata Kristo hakujipendeza mwenyewe,kuhusika kwake ilikuwa ni kwa wengine alijionyesha kwa upendo,mafundisho yake na uponyaji wake."Why should the Christian be concerned with others instead of himself? We should use Christ as our example, "For even Christ pleased not himself, His concern was for others demonstrated by his love, His teaching, and His healing."

#### Neno la Mungu ni chanzo cha mkristo kuwa na faraja kwa ajili ya maisha(mstr.4) ###The Word of God is the Christian's source of encouragement for living (v. 4)

Tunaweza kuwa na faraja wakati mahitaji kwa kuyasoma maandiko.Tunaweza pia kuendelea mbele kwa tumaini.We can be comforted in time of need by reading the Scriptures. We can also look forward in Hope.

#### Umoja katika mwili wa Kristo ni shabaha ya mkristo(mstr.5-6)Unity in the body of Christ is the goal of Christians (v. 5–6)

Tunaswa kuunganika katika nia moja na kwa roho inayomtukuza Mungu ambaye ni lengo letu la maisha.We should be united in one mind and spirit glorifying God who is our goal in life.

#### Kristo ni kiwango ambacho kwa hicho wakristo watakuja hukumiwa(mstr. 7) ####Christ is the standard by which Christians will be judged (v. 7)

#### Mungu hulinda neno lake na yeye ni mwenye huruma(mstr. 8–12)  #### God keeps His word and He is merciful (v. 8–12)

## Tunapaswa kufanya kazi ilikuwafikia wale ambao hawana neno la Mungu(mstr. 13–21) ## We are to labor in reaching those who are without (v. 13–21)

### Ninyi ni ndugu zangu na mmejazwa na mema mengi(mstr. 13–14)
### You are my brethren and filled with many good things (v. 13–14)

Maoni ya Paulo yalikuwa nini kuhusu wakristo wa Rumi?What was Paul's Opinion concerning the Christians at Rome?

* Paulo anamwamini Mungu kuelekea kuwasababisha kuwa na tumaini na nguvu (mstr. 13) *Paul believes God is going to cause them to abound in hope and power (v. 13)
* Walikuwa wamejawa na wema. *They were full of goodness.
* Walijawa na ujuzi wote.*They were filled with all knowledge.
* Waliweza kutangulizana. *They were able to admonish one another.

Ijapokuwa Paulo hakuwahi kuwa Rumi,Alijuwa na kufarijika kwa imani yao(1:8).
Although Paul had never been in Rome, he was aware and encouraged by their faith (1:8).

### ..Hata hivyo(mstr. 15–21) ##..Nevertheless (v. 15–21)

Kuna vitu vingi vya kutia moyo Paulo anaweza kusema na ameshasema lakini wote tunakitu cha kufanya.There are a lot of encouraging things Paul can say and has said (Romans 1:8), but we all have something to learn. 

#### Paulo aliandika kwa ujasiri(mstr. 15) #### Paul wrote boldly (v. 15)

Katika hatari inaonekana ya kutotambuliwa kwa mfano wao na imani,Paulo kama mhudumu mwaminifu wa changamoto za injili ujasir wa kanisa na vitu vya lazima.At the risk of sounding unappreciative of their example and faith, Paul as a faithful minister of the Gospel challenges the church boldly with necessary things.

#### Paulo alikuwa na wito na jukumu(mstr. 16a) Paul had a call and responsibility (v. 16a)

Je? Paulo anajirejea mwenyewe kama nini?kama ,mhudumu wa Yesu Kristo kwa mataifa.Akihubiri neno katika nguvu za Roho.Kwa ishara na maajabu kama uthibitisho.Utambulisho wa Paulo ulifunika wito wake.Paulo aliweka kipau mbele kwa wito wake na kuchelewesha matakwa na malengo binafsi.Sio kwamba kile anafanya hakina mzigo kwa ndugu zake,bali kile alichonacho ni wito ulikuwa unatangulia.What does Paul refer to himself as? A minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles. Preaching the Word in the power of the Spirit. With signs and wonders as the result. Paul's identity is wrapped up in His call. Paul Prioritizes his call and must delay personal desires and goals. It is not that he does not have a burden for his brethren, but that he has a call that takes precedent.

#### Paulo alikuwa na lengo(kujitoa sadaka kwa ajili ya mataifa)(mstr. 16b) (mstr. 17–21) #### Paul had a goal (the offering up of the gentiles) (v. 16b)

#### Paulo alikuwa na wasikilizaji(Mungu alinipa) ####Paul had an audience (God has given them to me) (v. 17–21)

Kadiri Paulo alivyokuwa na ujasiri anaongea,haogopi kusema lakini kwa kile ambacho Kristo amemwezesha:As boldly as Paul is speaking, he is careful not to speak but of that which Christ has wrought by him:

- Mungu ametumia kwa nguvu,lakini sio yote ambayo Mungu ametenda katika uwanja huu ameyafanya kwa kunitumia.-God has Used me mightily, but not all that God has done in this arena has he done using me. 
- Mimi sio mhudumu pekee kwa mataifa.-I'm not the only minister to the Gentiles.
- Kwa uangalifu:ruhusu wale walioponywa kutoa ushuhuda-Careful: allow those healed to testify
- Kwa uangalifu usifiche kile ambacho Mungu anafanya popote-Paulo hakutaka kujenga juu ya msingi wa mwingine(kazi)-Careful so as not to hinder what God is doing elsewhere - Paul did not wish to build on another man's foundation (work).
- Hapa watedakazi wamezuiliwa.-Here laborers have hindered.
- Nina ujumbe kwa ajili wale ambao hawajasikia(Mungu ameahidi hiyo mstr.21;I Isa 52:15; 65:1). - I Have a message for those who have not heard (God has promised it! v. 21; Isaiah 52:15; 65:1).

## Tunapaswa kufanya kazi katika kuwafikia wale ambao hawajafikiwa (mstr. 22–33) We are to labor in reaching those who are within (v. 22–33)

### Sio kwa kwa bahati njema ya upendo,bali kwa ajili ya sababu kubwa nimezuiliwa (mstr. 22–24)It is not for lack of love, but for a great cause i have been hindered (v. 22–24)

Kifungu "hizi nyakati nyingi"inaonyesha jinsi ani wakisto wa Roma kwa kuendelea walivyokuwa katika moyo wake na shauku zake.Kifungu "muda mrefu unaokuja"inaonyesha kwamba yeye alikuwa shauku kubwa ya kuwatembelea watu.The phrase "these many times" shows how continually Roman Christians were on his mind and his desire. The phrase "a longing to come" shows that he had a tremendous desire to visit these people.

### Ratiba ya Paulo(mstr. 25–28) ### Paul's itinerary (v. 25–28)

Paulo anaelezea tena shauku yake na kusudi lake la kutelea kanisa la Roma na ratiba yake.Alikuwa lazima kwanza aende Sipania na kukusanya sadaka kwa ajili ya watakatifu wa Yerusalemu.Yeye angeweza kuzileta Yerusalemu baada kile alichokusudia kutembelea Roma.Kwa jinsi gani wakristo wa Makedonia na Akaya walivyohusika na maskini miongoni wa wakristo walioko Yerusalemu?Walichangia kwa ajili ya maskini.Paulo mwenyewe pamoja na ndugu wengine walichukua hizi sadaka na kuzipeleka Yerusalemu,kupokea kwa mtu kile ambacho ni kanuni ya kiroho Paulo anawafundisha warumi kwa kuhusianisha hizi habari? Lilikuwa ni tendo la upendo juu ya sehemu ya watakatifu wa mataifa.Ilikuwa ni utimilizo wa maneno ya Bwana katika Yoh 13:17, 35. Paul restates again his desire and intention to visit the church at Rome and his itinerary. He must first go to Spain and collect an offering for the saints at Jerusalem. He would then bring the offering to Jerusalem, after which he intends to visit Roman. How are the Christians in Macedonia and Achaia concerned for the poor among the Christians at Jerusalem? They contributed to the poor. Paul himself together with other brethren took this offering back to Jerusalem, to deliver in person What spiritual principal is Paul teaching the Romans by relating this news? It was an act of love on the part of the Gentile Saints. It was a fulfilling of our Lord's words in John 13:17, 35.

## Hitimisho ##Conclusion

### Umoja wa utatu ###The Unity of the Trinity

Katika mstr wa 30 kwa mara ya kwanza tunaona utatu:In Verse 30 we once again see the trinity:

* Kwa ajili ya Bwana Yesu Kristo mwenyewe. *For the Lord Jesus Christ's sake.
* Kwa ajili ya upendo wa Roho.*For the love of the Spirit.
* Maombi yenu kwa Mungu kwa ajili yangu.*Your prayers to God for me.

### Baraka ### (mstr. 33)The benediction (v. 33)

"Mungu wa amani awe nanyi nyote," inaonyesha kwa jinsi gani moyo wa mtume ulikuwa umejawa na amani na kujawa mapensi ya Mungu!Inaonyesha pia upendo unaofurika kwa ajili ya watakatifu(mara mbili katika sura hii Paulo anaomba kwa ajili ya kanisa la Rumi.Angalia misitari ya 13 na 33).Kusudi na nguvu ilio nyuma ya umoja wa wakristo ni mfano wa upendo wa Kristo na huduma na dhabihu.Kuwa na msisimko kama huo miongoni mwa wakristo,tunahitaji kuomba kama Paulo alivyofanya uwezeshaji wa Bwana.Maana ya Paulo ya agizo kuu haikumfanya kuwa wakutegemewa na wakristo wenzake."The God of peace be with you all," shows how  the apostle's heart was fully at peace and fully in God's will! It also shows his overflowing love for the saints (twice in this chapter Paul **prays** for the church at Rome. See verses 13 and 33). The motive and power behind Christian unity is Christ's example of love and service and sacrifice. To have such harmony among Christians, we need to pray as Paul did for the Lord's enabling. Paul's sense of commission did not make him independent of his fellow Christians.
