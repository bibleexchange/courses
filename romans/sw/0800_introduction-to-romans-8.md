Kuwepo kwa Kristo ni kushirikishwa katika Mzabibu wa keli. Maisha yake aliyaweka kwetu na kile kilicho chake kimekuwa chetu. Mungu Baba ametuonyesha vile vilivyoko kwa Mwanawe wa pekee ambaye tumekuwa warithi wa Mungu. Kwa Kristo, hatushindani na mwili bali dhambi pekee, na wala hatupati ondoleo la dhambi pekee, bali tumempokea Kristo Mwenyewe. Waumini wako kwa Kristo na Kristo yuko kwa waumini {11:16-18}.  To be in Christ is to be grafted into the true vine. His life flows into us and what it is His is ours. God the Father views those in His Son as He views the only begotten–heirs of God. In Christ, we do not struggle against the flesh and sin alone, and have not received alone the remission of sin, but have received Christ Himself. The Believer is in Christ and Christ is in them (11:16-18).
