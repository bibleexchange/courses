# Sheria {torati} ilitawala juu ya mtu aishiye katika dhambi {sura 7} The Law Reigns over the Man Living in Sin (chapter 7)

## Utangulizi Introduction

Sheria kwa amri zake za hukumu zilitawala juu ya mtu yule anayeishi ndani ya dhambi. Maisha ya haki hayawezekani kwa kupitia kazi ya sheria kama wenye dhambi walivyofungwa dhambi zao. Hii sura inahusu umwili na mahusiano ya dhambi { kama waishivyo} kwenye dhambi na mauti. Sura hii pia inasisitiza kwamba sheria ya Mungu ni utakatifu. Kuna vitu vitatu katika sura hii:   The law with his prescription of condemnation has dominion over the man living in his sin. Righteousness in life is impossible through the works of the law as the sinner is bound to his sin. This chapter deals with carnality and the sinners relationship (so long as he lives) to sin and death. This chapter also emphasizes that the law of God is holy. There are three sections in this chapter:

1. **Dhambi imekufa na tuko huru kuoa mwingine** {mstr. 6}. Katika sehemu ya kwanza, Mungu alionyesha jinsi wale waliohesabiwa kwake chini ya sheria  walikombolewa kutoka kwa wale waliohusika kushiriki katika kifo cha Kristo; hivyo basi, tushiriki kumwinua Kristo, tutazaa matunda; na kukombolewa kutoka dhambi, tutakuwa na furaha na kumtumikia Yeye. Mtume Paulo aliwakumbusha ndugu zake Wayahudi kwamba nguvu ya sheria imeondolewa, na alitumia mfano hai wa mke ambaye amekuwa huru kwa kufiwa na mme wake kuolewa na mwingine. Wazo kuu ni kifo kuvunja ahadi ya wajibu wa kisheria na juu ya kifo kile cha mwanaume huyo mwnamke yuko huru kisheria kuchukua mkataba kwa ndoa nyingine.  Sin has died and we are free to marry another** (v. 1–6). In the first section, God shows how those that were placed by Him under the law were released from that relation by sharing in the death of Christ; so that, joined to a risen Christ, they bear fruit; and released from law, they are glad and willing to serve Him. The Apostle Paul reminds his Jewish brethren that the power of the law is terminated, and uses the illustration of a wife who has been freed by the death of her husband to marry another. The main thought is death dissolves legal obligation and that on the death of her husband a wife is legally free to contract another marriage.
2. **Sheria ni takatifu, rahisi, na njema** {mstr.7-13}. Paulo alieleza kuwa utawala wa dhambi sio kwamba ni makosa ya sheria ya Mungu. sheria ni njema, bali dhambi ilichukua manufaa ya yeye.  The law is holy, just, and good** (v. 7–13). Paul explains that sin's dominion is not that the fault of the Law of God. The law is good, but sin took advantage of him.
3. **Kufungwa kwa Paulo kwa sheria ya dhambi** {mst. 14-25}. Katika sehemu ya mwisho, tunayo ushuhuda wa Paulo wa mapigano yake chini ya sheria kama Muisraeli, mbele ya uzoefu mkuu wa kweli ambayo Kristo alifia sheria na dhambi.  Paul's captivity to the law of sin** (v. 14–25). In the final section, we have Paul testifying of his struggle under the law as an Israelite, before he experienced the great truth that in Christ he was dead to the law and to sin.
