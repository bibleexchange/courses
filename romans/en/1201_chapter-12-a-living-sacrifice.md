# A living sacrifice (chapter 12)

## Introduction

Romans chapters 12-16 complete the final section of this book. This section is particularly practical in its instruction. We see the righteousness of God applied to the daily life of the believer.

Romans chapter twelve deals with the Christian's duties, which ultimately leads to a surrendered life. The church is compared to the human body. There should be unity among the body, if there is no unity, the body will not function properly. This chapter also deals with the different duties of the church. This chapter ends with the Christian spirit. We are not to overcome but not with evil but we are to overcome with good.

## The living sacrifice (v. 1-2) 

### Special words and phrases in verses 1-2

Often times words lose their value with us with overuse. Let us look more closely at the vocabulary of the first two verses of this chapter that we may gain a deeper understanding of it:

* **Beseech** — This has the ideas of to call near and entreat. This is a plea in earnest.
* **Therefore** — What is it THERE FOR? All of Chapter eleven expresses what grace has brought about. The outcast has been included. Therefore, we must do....
* **Brethren** — He speaks to those that have been blood bought and born again. Not, the Israel of Isaac, but of the spiritual Israel. 
* **Mercies of God** — It is by the mercy of God that we would be hearing such a plea. Had it not been for God's mercy shown on the road to Damascus, Paul could not make such a plea. He does not make the plea because he is better than everyone, but because of God's mercy is he qualified to make such a plea.
* **Bodies** — In the mortal body we must glorify God. Not just someday and for now do the best that we can. ...We should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.—Titus 2:12
* **Living sacrifice** — The flesh must be crucified. Our will must be crucified. We offer alive, but God thoroughly will purge us as long as we remain on the altar.
* **Holy** — Our lives ought to be light to those that wander in the darkness.
* **Acceptable unto God** — fully agreeable; well pleasing In this age full of men pleasers, we must seek our approval from God. What does He think about a direction you take? To be accepted by this world is to be rejected by Him. We cannot be agreeable with the flesh and this world and at the same time be agreeable to God. There must be a clear line of alliance defined. Who will you side with?
* **Reasonable service** — His yoke is easy, but any requirement God could make of us would pale in greatness to what He has provided for us.
* **Conformed** — Conform to the same pattern; fashion self according to; 
* **Transformed** — metamorphosis; change; This is the miraculous work of God.
* **Renewing of your mind** — Our mind is made new by the Word. Replace our carnal thoughts with What saith the Lord.
* **Good, acceptable, and perfect will of God** — This is not God's three wills, but three adjectives of God's one sovereign will. He is not double-minded (or triple-minded for that matter).

### God's perfect will

This is Paul's great plea for personal consecration to God. Paul teaches that each believer should desire the perfect will of God. Instructions are given for the believer to follow.

### The sacrifice

Verse 1 says tells us to "present your bodies," this means that we need to give not only the soul to God, but the body as well. It is a free will offering, and it will cost you something. It is a living sacrifice. We must present ourselves ALIVE to God!

### What are the "mercies of God" to which Paul refers?

1. Justification - including pardon, removal from sins, trespasses never to be remembered, a right standing in Christ - being made the righteousness of God in Him.
2. Identification - taken out of Adam by death with Christ - dead to sin and the law - we now become identified with Christ.
3. Under Grace - Fruit unto God - unto sanctification, made possible.
4. The Spirit Indwelling - the spirit witnesses of son-ship and heir-ship.
5. Help in Infirmity - and in any present sufferings, on our way to share Christ's glory.
6. Divine Election - our final conformity to the image of Christ - God's settled purpose.
7. Coming Glory - beyond any comparison with sufferings.
8. No Separation Possible - God loves us in Christ.
9. Confidence in God's Faithfulness - confirmed by His revealed plans for Israel.

### Reasonable Service

**God has given so much to His people**. He has given grace, He has dealt to every man the measure of faith, He has made one body in Christ, and He has given gifts of prophecy, ministry, and teaching.

**God's people are responsible to act accordingly**. We have to think soberly, give with simplicity, rule with diligence, show mercy with cheerfulness, love be without dissimulation, abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good, be kindly affectioned, show brotherly love, prefer one another, be not slothful in business, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord, rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, continue in prayer, distribute to the necessity of saints, give hospitably, bless them which persecute you, rejoice with them that do rejoice, weep with them that weep, and be of the same mind one toward another.

### Being not conformed to the world

The believer and his lifestyle is to be remarkably different than the world. The world uses the principles of God to become successful for their own gain. We are to use the principles of God to become successful not for us but for Him and His kingdom. Why do I want to be a successful Christian? Success is learning how to lead others to Christ. We are to pattern our lives after Christ. 

### Be transformed

> The work of the Holy Ghost first begins in the understanding, and is carried on to the will, affections, and conversation, till there is a change of the whole man into the likeness of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness. Thus, to be godly, is to give up ourselves to God.  
> —Matthew Henry's Commentary

### Renewed in the mind

The renewing of the mind happens through the Word of God (Psalm 119:9, 105). It is a Work of the Holy Spirit. The entire mind must come under the spirits control (Ephesians 5:17-20—17). The renewed mind is the mind of Christ. It is not just a different mind or another mind, but the work of God in us produces the mind of Christ (Php. 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:14-16; Luke 19:10; 2 Tim. 1:7; John 8:50).

## The Christian's attitude toward other Christians (v. 3-8)

We are one body in Christ, with varying gifts. Everyone members one of another. What is the one possessing a gift supposed to do with it? The various gifts are bestowed by the Spirit. The working of the gifts are for prophecy, ministering, teaching, exhorting, etc. The possession of a gift is of no use unless it is put to use. It is the whole-hearted exercise of the gifts, when it is given, that is urged by the apostles. Gifts are a directly given of the Spirit. Faith is necessary to receive and use these gifts.

## Commands to the believer (v. 9-21)

### Love truly (v. 9a)

_Dissimulation_ means "concealment of one's thoughts, feelings, or character; pretense." Love unfeigned is evidenced by kindness (2 Cor. 6:6).

### Love good and abhor evil (v. 9b)

> Psalm 34:14—Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

"Evil" is that which is hurtful, degenerate in nature, of the devil, malicious, or bad. We need to run away from evil and run toward good. This is not a fearfulness of evil as in superstition, but is a sanctification or separation of our conduct and thought life from those things that are contrary to the holiness of God. How can we "abhor" and "depart" from evil? (Psalm 37:27; Isaiah 1:16)

## Conclusion to Romans 12

Being a Christian involves every area of a persons life. Mind and body are yielded to God in moral surrender as a spiritual offering. By his attitude and actions toward other Christians he is to demonstrate the fact that he is a fellow-member with them in the body of Christ. In his relationship with the sinner, he is to act in love and leave to God the avenging of evil.
