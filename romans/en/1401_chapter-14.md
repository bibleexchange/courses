# Differences of opinion among Christians (chapter 14)

## Introduction

Romans chapter fourteen talks about how you should treat a weak brother. We need to help those that are weak in their faith. We see the need to be charitable. We need to live for God, and all that we do needs to be unto God. We should not judge one another, for one day every man will give an account of his own life.

## How should we treat Christians with differences of opinion? (v. 1)

There are differences in the health of our faith and there are also differences of opinion (weak and strong). There is clear instruction given in Scripture:

* "Thou shalt not" in the 10 Commandments (Exodus 20:1–17)
* Salvation is through Jesus (John 8:24; 14:6; Acts 4:12)
* You cannot serve both God and riches (Proverbs 28:22; Ephesians 4:19; 1 Timothy 6:10; Matthew 6:24)

But There is also a lot of opinion of interpretation and application that fill in-between the lines. Christians divide over things such as:

* Politics (Can you be a Christian and be a Democrat?)
* Woman in ministry (Can a woman be a pastor?)
* The internet (Can a Christian remain holy while using an unholy thing?)
* The blood of Jesus
* The authority of the Word of God
* The baptism of the Holy Ghost
* Saturday/Sunday debate

### Receive him that is weak in the faith, but not so that you can argue with him

Most often our opinions are inspired by Scripture, but we tend to fill the gray (unexplained) areas of Scripture with our opinions. The differences of opinion should not be cause for division or an excuse for quarreling.

Should everybody be just like me?

## What is a weak brother in this context? (v. 2–4)

The weakness Paul mentions here carries the very ideas of disease and impotence. Those weak in faith are likened to a lame man needing a crutch, a blind needing a guide, or a paralyzed man needing help with every necessity of daily life. Disease ultimately will snuff out life if it is not cured. This weakness of faith is as a sickness that must be understood and handled with grace, but also must be administered healing. Weakness must not be left alone, but must be strengthened (James 5:16).

### Weakness in eating

In I Corinthians chapter 8 Paul had to deal with this same issue with the Corinthian church. This may sound trivial and non-religious of a dispute to the modern Christian, but The Layman's Bible Commentary gives insight into this controversy:

> It was a different kind of religious question in the Roman Empire. The fact is in a Roman market you could hardly find a steak or a roast or any kind of meat that had not come from some animal slaughtered in a heathen temple. The animal would be killed as a sacrifice; then the priests (who, numerous though they were, could not possibly eat all the animals the people offered) would sell the meat through retail outlets. This being the major source of meats on the market, the Christian shopper was faced with a problem: in buying and eating this meat, am I or am I not helping out the heathen worship?

### Servants — Who are you to judge another man's servant?

### Judgment — Every man must give account to God and not to another.

### Days

The spirit of the law does not ask "did you remember the day?", but it asks "did you do it as unto the Lord?" They worshiped on certain days, they fasted and feasted on certain days, and they were putting more importance on days and not the Christ.

## We are brethren and not judges (v. 5–12)

Verse six clearly states that both sides of the argument know the Lord.

What we are supposed to be doing for others:

* **Show honor and preference** (12:10; 15:7)
* **Admonish one another** (15:14; Col. 3:16) We are to love the heart of men, and reach out to the heart of men. We put our heart into other people by loving them. We show compassion by encouraging other people. Love corrects, encourages, and teaches. In order for us to teach someone the difference between right and wrong, we first need to know the difference ourselves.
* **Forgive one another** (Col. 3:13)
* **Stop judging** (Romans 14:13)
* **We are to carry each others burdens** (Gal. 6:2)

## Do not put a stumbling block in my brother's way, (v. 13–17)

## We are told to pursue after peace in our differences (v. 18–20)

## The blessing of liberty (v. 22–23)

It is Much more blessed to have liberty before God which we do not use on account of our brother's weaknesses, than to insist on liberty, though it is distinctly given.
