## Will be glorified through the ministry of the Holy Ghost (v. 26–30)

### The Holy Spirit helps our weaknesses (v. 26)
 
The Holy Spirit is our divine helper.
 
### Jesus is our intercessor (v. 27)
 
Hebrews 7:25; 1 John 2:1; 1 Timothy 2:5

### God's purpose wins (v. 28)
 
God providentially cares for his people (the called). These "called" are not just invited, but they are appointed. Here "the called" are marked by the electing grace of God. As God is sovereign, if God has a purpose, it will come to pass. To be conformed to the image of His Son is God's major purpose in the life of the Christian (v. 29).

## Have God as their advocate (v. 31–39)

The end of the chapter deals with the Christian's hope, which is "If God be for us who can be against us." It also deals with the idea that we are more than conquerors and that all things work together for good. The sufferings we go through are to teach us our motives.

### The power of God's love (v. 35–39) 
 
* God's love is unaffected by the extreme conditions — "Neither death nor life" (Rom. 14:8; Phil. 1:20, 21)
* God's love is unaffected by spiritual powers — "Nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers"
* God's love is unaffected by time — "present or to come"
* God's love is unaffected by life's circumstances — "nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature"

## Conclusion

The two fold secret of Christian living is described by two phrases in verse 1 and verse 10: "in Christ Jesus" and "if Christ be in you." The Christian's will is to live in Christ an life pleasing to God. The Holy Spirit dwells in us, empowering us to live such a life.
