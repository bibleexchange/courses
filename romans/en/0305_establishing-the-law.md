## The Establishing of the Law (v. 31)

> *Justification is by faith without the deeds of the Law. The Law is: an advantage to those who know it (vs. 1-2), absolute in its nature (vs. 3-8), unbending in its authority (vs. 9-19), has a distinct purpose (vs. 20-30), and is not made void, but rather is established	by our faith. (v. 31).*

Justification by faith establishes the Law.

Justification by faith is not against the Law of Moses. Salvation by faith in Christ satisfied the Law of God. Jesus completely fulfilled or established the demands of the Law. There is also a reference here the moral law. Faith does not void the moral law of God.
The ceremonial law has been fulfilled in Christ. We no longer need to offer goats and bulls to God, nor keep the ceremonial law. The moral law of God does not change. Justification by faith does not abolish the moral law of God. 

The law of faith does not make the law useless or void, but establishes it. Faith does not remove or destroy the law, but excels the law. 

The law brings the knowledge of sin to a man, and that man who has recognized his condition may be justified by faith. Without the law that man would have no knowledge of sin, and therefore would see no need for justification, redemption, or atonement. The law which was once broken is established through faith in the finished work of Christ. For through His righteousness it is SATISFIED.
