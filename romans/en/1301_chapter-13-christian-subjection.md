# Christian submission (chapter 13)

## Overview of chapter 13

Romans chapter thirteen talks about our duty to the state and the law, also the duties of citizenship. In it we see that love is the fulfilling of the law and that we need to make no provision for the flesh (v. 14).

If we are to receive of the promise of Psalm 47:3 (He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.) then we are going to have to learn to be in submission our selves—to God and to his delegated authorities. Let us explore "Christian submission" (submission to rulers as ordained of God) in Romans chapter thirteen.

## The bounds of our submission (v. 1)

Chapter 12 emphasizes our need to surrender our bodies as living sacrifices, and chapter 13 teaches on the importance of submission to authority.

The second part of verse 2 tells us that all power comes from God. All power belongs unto God (Ps. 62:10–11; 29:10; Matt. 19:26). An earthly power has to receive its influence from the sovereign God (Col. 1:16–17; Dan. 2:21). We are bound by God to be in submission to authority. This mandate comes from God.

## The temptation of our submission (v. 2)

Since all power belongs unto God, when we submit ourselves to men, we are really submitting ourselves to God. To oppose God is to oppose ourselves. We do not hurt God when we disobey as so much as we hurt ourselves.

## The reason for our submission (v. 3–5)

### We submit to avoid wrath (v. 3–4)

Rebellion has a great price. Damnation is what Paul presents as rebellion's cost. There is no terror for the subject for rulers are ordained by God as a terror to good works but to the evil. Avoid the wrath of their sword (Rom. 12:18; Heb. 12:2).

### We submit because of our consciences (v. 5)

God ordains authority for the purpose of defending good and disciplining evil. Authorities are designed for our own good and protection. Without leadership only disorder and chaos can arise.

We should be in submission not just to avoid punishment, but also to preserve our own clear conscience. For the Christian, God commands us to be in submission.

## How do we submit? (v. 6–10)

### We submit by paying taxes (v. 6–7)

> Matthew 22:21—They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.

The principle consistent in Scripture is that so long as "Caesar" is not requiring what is God's than we are to remain in submission. As much as it is possible, we are to live peaceably. Perhaps 4 or 5 years before Paul writes this epistle to the Romans, there was a decree put out by Roman government that made it illegal for Jews (and by extension, Christians) to remain in the City of Rome. The justification for this decree stemmed from popular gossip that Jews were troublemakers. Paul does not address the "civil rights" of the Jews and Christians in this chapter, but emphasizes instead, their own responsibility.

In verses 6 and 7 we see examples of submission to civil authority:

1. Tribute to whom tribute is due
2. Custom to whom custom
3. Fear to whom fear
4. Honor to whom honor
  
### We submit by obeying the law of love (v. 8–10)

Love fulfills the law. Being subject to love is to fulfill the law. In John 14:15 Jesus said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments." The believer is in a "new creation", and is to walk by that infinitely higher "rule of life" (Gal. 6:15–16) and not by law. In loving he has fulfilled the lower law.

## The urgency of our submission (v. 11–12)
 
The Lord promises to return, but when He comes will He find faith in the earth? (Luke 18:8)

## The quality of our submission (v. 13–14)

### Our walk

Every student, Christian must have a purpose, or vision, else we will fail. This is something that Christ will give us.

### Are we doing our work or God's work?

This is not our work, but his work. Our work is do the will of Him that called us. It is to do his work (John 4:34). If we are called, than we have a purpose to be reveled to our lives. This revelation of God's purpose for our life is received through prayer.

As ministers you are required to bring others to the knowledge of Christ; So that they seek the word of God for themselves. (The woman at the well, she believed because of what the word said)

### Our opportunity

Opportunity is found right where you are. When are obedient and willing to the will of God, we become tools in the Master's hands.

## Conclusion to chapter 13

The commands of this chapter apply to us today as well as to Paul's day. The Christian should behave in every situation in accordance with who God is and what God does. The Christian's perspective is oriented to God's view of the world and God's purpose in the world.
