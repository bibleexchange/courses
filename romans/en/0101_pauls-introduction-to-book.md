# Paul's Introduction to Romans (1:1-17)

## Paul's Salutation (v. 1-7)

An apostle is one who has been SENT FORTH as a messenger or representative of and fully authorized by the senderâ€”a delegate or ambassador. (Acts 9:3-9, 15-22, 28) Paul's calling was not earthly. He was not even a candidate in the vote taken in Acts 1, but Paul's calling and sending forth as an apostle came from Christ. (1:5) Paul emphasizes that he was called to be an Apostle; this calling was by God and not by man.

Paul was a "preacher of the Gospel." He was a separated messenger with a special Message. The Gospel is a mystery (Mark 4:11; I Tim. 3:9,16; Col. 2:2; 4:3; Eph. 1:9) and a Divine revelation. (Acts 9).

Absolute consecration is spoken of in these words. Paul was set apart to preach one message and only one message. Paul did not declare a message that exalted himself nor did he do a work to further his position in the eyes of men. Paul declares that his purpose in life was the Gospel of God, and so should this be our purpose as ministers of the Gospel.

### His Message (v. 1-5)

Paul's message is the Gospel. The Gospel does not originate from Paul and is wholly concerned with Jesus Christ: our Lord, seed of David, Son of God, resurrected.

### His Readers (v.6-7)

Those connected to Jesus are connected with Him by His calling. The Called that Paul is writing to does not simply mean those invited, but means those invited that have come.

It is unquestionable that the recipients of this epistle were the Roman Christians (v. 7, 15). Scripture seems to point to a predominantly Gentile Roman church as Paul's manner of addressing the church leaves hardly any doubt that he is writing to Gentiles. In chapter one, Paul speaks of his apostleship for obedience of the faith among all the nations (1:5). He refers to the recipients as "other gentiles" and also gives as his reason for being ready to preach the Gospel to them as that he is debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians (1:14), and that the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation, though to the Jew first, yet to the Greek also (1:16).

When the position and prospects of the Jewish nation are under review and Paul comes to admonition, it is to the Gentile believers that he addresses it (1:13; 11:13; 15:15-16).

The family of God comprises of saints called out of the world by God's grace to be His own people (I Cor. 1:2). Saints are those who are set apart for worship and praise. Another word key to understanding the meaning of "saints" is "sanctified." Saints are directly opposed to sin. Saints are those who allow holiness to become a reality in their lives. True righteousness is a phenomenon of the will. True righteousness always produces outward action and inward results. Every form of sin must be put out of the heart. As moral agents our intellect must disapprove of sin.

### Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ

This is a common greeting of Paul in his epistles. The title "Jesus Christ our Lord" or "Lord Jesus Christ" is used ten times in Romans. Jesus is the personal name as Savior. Matt. 1:21. Christ is "God's anointed one" Lord denotes He is Lord of all things in heaven and earth (Acts 10:36). Jesus Christ our Lord is the Master of every situation!

## Paul's Readiness (to Visit, Impart & Preach)	 (v. 8-15)

Verses 8-15 express Paul's personal feelings for the Roman saints.

### Paul is thankful for the faith of the Roman saints and so prays for them (v. 8-9)

The whole world is in reference to the domain of the Roman Empire which often referred to itself as the whole world. It was Augustus who made the decree at the birth of Christ that the whole world should be taxed, which was in reference to the dominions of Rome.

The faith of the saints in Rome was spoken of throughout the entire Empire. These Roman Christians are the "Beloved of God," "Called to be saints," and recipients of the grace and peace "from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ." Their testimony bears out that they are separated unto God and represent the King of Glory. What a treasure a good testimony is! Paul stands on the battleground in prayer that their faith and testimony would continue.

### He has a great desire to visit the Roman saints and impart spiritual gifts unto them because of his motive to see the church established (v. 10-12)

Rome was strategic, but Paul is led by the Spirit and not statistics. It is probable that Paul realized the strategic value of building up the church in the capital city of the Roman Empire, but Paul was a caliber of minister that would invest as heavily in a city no one ever heard of. He was blessed to hear that there were saints in Rome and desired to visit them to do his part to strengthen the church there. It is logical that a revival in the city of Rome would have impact on the entire Empire, but the truth is, God could choose any place to be the start of a revival that would turn the world upside down (Acts 17:6).

### Paul had been hindered from going to Rome (v. 13-15)

He had wanted to and even planned to go, but he had been hindered. Paul would one day go to Rome as a prisoner to stand before the Roman leaders and proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The book of Acts tells us that Paul dwelt two years in Rome. It is believed that he was under house arrest during this time of being in Rome. He was beheaded in Rome in AD 67.

Paul had great desire to preach the Gospel in Rome. He uses the word "debtor" in reference to himself to show that he is committed to preach to all men (v. 14). He was a debtor to the sinner to tell him about Christ. "Greeks" is used to refer to the wise Gentiles who have been educated in Greek culture and philosophy. "Barbarians" is used to refer to those outside of the Greek culture, that would not have been educated. Paul is ready to preach to everyone.
