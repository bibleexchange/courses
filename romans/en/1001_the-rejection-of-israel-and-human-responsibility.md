# The Rejection of Israel and Human Responsibility (9:30-10:21)

## Stumbling and Overcoming: The Conclusion of Chapter 9 (9:30-33)

### Righteousness Through Faith (9:30)

The Gentiles, not following after righteousness (righteousness by the Law), attain to it by faith. Faith is contrasted in the text in this way: Seeking righteousness by the keeping of the Law versus seeking righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ.

### No Righteousness Through the Law (9:31)

Israel followed after the law of righteousness, but could not attain it (They could not keep the law). Israel, following after the Law stumbled at the way.

### Must Seek Righteousness By Faith (9:32)

Israel did not seek it by faith.

### A Stumblingstone is Laid (9:33)

They stumbled over the rock of offense. They stumbled over Jesus. NOTE: The only way to have Christ in your life is to believe on Him. Otherwise he is a "rock of offense." He offended the leaders of Israel by exposing sin.

What is the message of the Gospel that is open to all? "And whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed." God's mercy is illustrated by His dealings with both Jew and Gentile. Humility and awe are the proper attitudes for both Jew and Gentile who experience the mercy and kindness of God. Whether a man is a Jew or a Gentile, his salvation depends upon more or less than what he thinks and does with Jesus. Submission to God's way of righteousness by personal acknowledgement of Jesus as the risen Lord, brings a man into "Right standing with God."

## Salvation for the Jews (10:1-21)

#### THEY ARE NOT SAVED (10:1)

The Gospel is for the Jew (Rom. 1:16; 2:9-10). The Majority of the Jews rejected the Gospel (Acts 2:22). The first persecution of Christians organised by the Roman government took place under the emperor Nero in 64 AD after the Great Fire of Rome. So the first, perseuction of Christians was largely from the Jews (Acts 9:1-2).

### The Jews' zeal (10:2)

The Pharisees: Minute Prescriptions added to the Law (Acts 23:6; 26:5; Php. 3:5-6). Paul does not ignore their efforts. He witnesses to their "zeal of God."

### The Jews' ignorance (10:3-11)

They had a zeal of God, but were missing important truth: The Righteousness of God which is by faith. The Object of this faith is Jesus Christ the only begotton Son of God Who is the End of the Law Through Faith. This faith comes by the Word of God and does not require ascending to Heaven or Hell first, but is already nigh.

### The Jews' path to God (10:12-15)

### The Jew's Rejection of the Gospel (10:16-21)

**Read Isaiah 65:1-10**. God sends a preacher -> a preacher preaches -> an audience hears -> the hearer believes -> the believer calls on the name of the Lord -> the Lord saves him. Where is the DISCONNECT? "They have not obeyed or heeded the Gospel."

* Did God send a preacher? YES (v. 19, 20, Moses, Isaiah, etc.)
* Did the Preacher Preach? YES (v. 16, report or PREACHING)
* Did the Audience Hear? YES (v. 18, Moses Foretold, Isaiah Foretold)

The Hearers refused to believe. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN GOD's PLAN OF REDEMPTION. God is using the Gentiles to provoke the Jew to Jealousy (10:19).
