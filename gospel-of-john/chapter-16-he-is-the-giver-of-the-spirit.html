<h1>Chapter 16: He is the Giver of the Spirit</h1>
<h2>The Promise of the Spirit 16:1-16</h2>
<h3>The Spirit will comfort 16:1-7</h3>
<p>Jesus knew that soon a time of tribulation and trial would come to His disciples, and so He sought to console them. It is never promised that we will not have problems, rather we have been warned that those problems will certainly come; what is promised is that we will be delivered out of those trials and afflictions (Psalm 34:19). We may have to walk through the valley of the shadow of death, but He is walking with us all the way and will bring us out to the other side.</p>
<p>“Whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.” It is a sad time that we live in, but there are many people that think they are helping God out by telling true Christians that they think they are wrong. The majority of “churches” this day will stand up for sin and defend the unrighteous while at the same time they condemn the preacher of holiness for not having any love. They call evil good and good evil (Isaiah 5:20).</p>
<p>Jesus offered them consolation by promising the advent of the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit (John 14:26; Acts 9:31). If the Spirit is resting upon us, then we can be happy even if we are reproached (I Peter 4:14).</p>
<h3>The Spirit will convict 16:8-11</h3>
<h4>The Spirit will reprove the world of sin 16:9</h4>
<h4>The Spirit will reprove the world of righteousness 16:10</h4>
<h4>The Spirit will reprove the world of judgment 16:11</h4>
<h3>The Spirit will teach 16:12-16</h3>
<p>There were many things that Jesus wanted to tell His disciples, but He knew that they were not yet ready to bare them. That did not mean that they would never be able to comprehend these hidden things, for Jesus promised a time when the Holy Spirit reveal to them these things. When we study the Word of God, we cannot approach the task with mere intellectual ability, but we need to seek the revelation of the Spirit to make the Word alive to us. There are many things that cannot be understood by natural senses, but the Sprit can show them to us (I Corinthians 2:9, 10; Ephesians 3:1-6).</p>
<h2>The Prophecy of Sorrow and Joy 16:17-33</h2>
<h3>Sorrow over His departure 16:17-22</h3>
<p>The disciples did not understand what Jesus meant when He said, “A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.” Though they did not understand, they did not ask Jesus what He meant. Jesus knew what they were thinking and responded to their questions without them being voiced. He made it veryclear that there would soon be a time when they would lament at the same event that caused the world to rejoice; we know this event to be the crucifixion.</p>
<p>Jesus comforted them by letting them know that their sorrow would not last, for as a mother may cry greatly during child birth, she soon forgets the pain as she holds her new born babe. The crucifixion surely would seem horrifying to the disciples as it occurred, but afterwards they would be able to look back at it and proclaim that it was a great joy for it brought them salvation. Both Peter (I Peter 1:10, 11) and John (I John 1:7; 3:16) later give witness that this brutal crucifixion that they witnessed proved to be for the betterment of humanity.</p>
<h3>Joy over answered prayer 16:23-28</h3>
<p>Jesus then told His disciples about a joy that would come to them because of how the Father would hear and answer their prayers. He told them that a time would come when He would not have to be an agent between them and the Father for special requests, but they themselves would be able to petition God in the name of Jesus and He would answer their prayers. If they loved Jesus then God would love them and answer their prayers. Because of the work of Jesus on the cross we have the privilege to go boldly to the throne of God and make requests of Him (Heb. 4:14-16).</p>
<p>Jesus also said that when that time came, He would no longer speak to them in proverbs and parables, but He would openly declare to them the Word of the Father. The Old Testament is filled with types and symbols, and while Jesus was on the earth, most of His teaching was done through parables. Now, as we mentioned above, Jesus has sent the Spirit of Truth and if a man is truly seeking to know the things of God’s Word, then He will make them plainly known to him.</p>
<h3>Peace in tribulation 16:29-33</h3>
<p>The disciples told Jesus that even now they understood what He was saying and believed that He was the Son of God. Jesus asked them if they really believed as He warned them of the coming tribulation. He knew that later that night He would be betrayed and executed. If they truly believed, then they would stay with Him even though it might mean being persecuted with Him. The disciples believed in their head, but their hearts had not yet received this same revelation. There are some men that study history and believe that Jesus was a great man, but they never really come to a salvation experience. Our religion needs to be more than one of the intellect, but it must be from the innermost soul.</p>
<p>Jesus knew that they would all forsake Him and flee, but He also knew that He would not be alone for the Father would be with Him. We can rest assure that even if all mankind turns against us, then God will still be with us.</p>
<p>He concluded the chapter by telling them that He spoke these things consisting of chapter thirteen and fourteen to let them know that they could find peace in Him even in the midst of tribulation. Jesus assured them that this tribulation would come, but they should not let it destroy them for He has overcome the whole world. God never said that things would be easy for us, but He did say that He would help us through every trial.</p>
