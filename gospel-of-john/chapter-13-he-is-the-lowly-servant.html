<h1>Chapter 13: He is the Lowly Servant</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we see Jesus exalted by both God and man to be the King of kings that is worthy of our glory and honor. This does not mean that He is a cruel and un-compassionate ruler that is unconcerned with the lives of His subjects. In this chapter we see the King step off His lofty throne and minister to the humble needs of His followers to teach us a lesson in humility by washing their feet.</p>
<h2>Jesus Washes the Disciples’ Feet 13:1-17</h2>
<p>Four days after Jesus made His triumphant entry into Jerusalem, it was time to prepare for the Passover. This was a Thursday, and the feast would begin at sundown being that Jewish days began when the sun had set. Jesus had His disciples prepare a room for them to eat the Passover meal (Mark 14:12-16) and now they were settled and ready to eat the meal.</p>
<h3>Jesus’ reason for washing their feet 13:1-5</h3>
<p>Jesus knew that before the sun rose again that the shadow of death would separate Him from His disciples and He wanted them to know of His great love for them once again. He even reached out in love to Judas whom He knew had made a plan to betray Him. This is the same love that He shows to us. Jesus did not first show us love when we were righteous and walking with God, but He revealed His love long before we ever knelt at an altar when we were wretched, miserable sinners (Rom. 5:8).</p>
<p>To show them His love, He humbled Himself to the level of a servant and started to wash the feet of His disciples, which were dusty and tired after traveling many miles in pursuit of their beloved Master. Jesus will not make us toil for His kingdom without rewarding us. There may be times when we labor tremendously for the Gospel and almost faint from exhaustion, but He will not leave us defenseless, but He will lead us to a place of rest and restore our souls (Ps. 23:2, 3). Jesus knew that His disciples had been through hard times and wanted to give them an opportunity to rest and prepare for the greater trials that they would face later that night.</p>
<h3>Peter’s objection to Jesus washing his feet 13:6-11</h3>
<p>When it came time for Jesus to wash Peter’s feet, Peter greatly rejected. He had such a great respect for Jesus that he could not bring himself to let this great Man perform such a lowly task for him. Jesus told him that he might not yet understand why He was washing their feet, but there would come a time when he would know and understand the reason. Perter still would not bend and said that Jesus would never wash his feet.</p>
<p>Jesus said that if Peter would not let Him wash his feet then he would never have any part with Him. If we are to be joined with Christ, then we must first be cleansed by Him. There are many people that want to be know as Christians, yet they are unwilling to let God remove the filth of sin from their lives. Peter responded and told Jesus then to wash not only his feet, but also his head and hands too. Jesus told Him that washing his feet was enough to make him clean.</p>
<p>Jesus then told the twelve that they all were not clean. He knew that Judas was in the process of betraying Him and that his soul had been tarnished by greed and selfishness. Jesus could have openly condemned Judas and expelled him from the group, but He wanted Judas to have every possible opportunity to repent of his sin. This is why He continued to warn Judas through careful speeches and did not openly rebuke him.</p>
<h3>Jesus’ explanation of washing their feet 13:12-17</h3>
<p>When Jesus was done washing their feet, they set down to eat the Passover meal. Through the remainder of this chapter and the entirety of chapter fourteen we see Jesus explain some last words to His disciples as they sit around this table.</p>
<p>He began by explaining the reason He washed their feet. It was to show them His humility. He was their leader and the greatest among them, and yet He was willing to perform the lowest responsibility possible. He did this for their example, for if He, the greatest, was willing to be so humble, then we too should be willing to be humble. Most times when a person gets elevated to a high position, they will not do the work of someone that they feel is less important than them. We must show humility and do the work of God even if it is not glorious at times and even if we feel that we are too important to do such work.</p>
<p>Happiness comes from humility. Jesus told them that if they were to obey this principle of humility then they would be truly happy. People that are always looking for other people to get the work done are never happy and content, but people that see the need and are willing to work to see it fulfilled no matter how hard or dirty it may get are the people that are most successful in life.</p>
<h2>Jesus Foretells Judas’ Betrayal 13:18-30</h2>
<p>Jesus already mentioned in verse eleven that He knew that there was a traitor among them and we know that He knew it was Judas. He again reaches out to Judas and quotes Psalm 41:9, which says, “Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.” Jesus warned the disciples that He was not speaking about all of them, but He also wanted Judas to know that He knew what He had done and was giving him the opportunity to confess. In verse twenty-one He clearly tells them that He knows one of them will betray Him.</p>
<p>This alarmed the disciples. From what Jesus said they knew that not all of them would betray Him, but who was that one that would do such a despicable thing? They all began to look around at each other wondering whom the guilty one was. Peter was tired of wondering and wanted a direct answer, so he beckoned to John, who was leaning on Jesus. Peter told him to ask Jesus who it was and John obeyed and asked Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus answered that it would be the one to whom He gave the piece of bread after He dipped it in the wine. He then dipped the bread and handed it to Judas along with the command, “That thou doest, do quickly.” Judas here was faced with a final opportunity-¬either he could ask Jesus for forgiveness or he could follow the lust of his flesh. Judas chose to obey his baser desires and gave in to his greed. This greed was an open door for the devil to come into his life and take over, which he did. We cannot continually reject the love of Jesus and follow our own will forever without serious consequences. There will come a time when any small sin can lead to a possession of the devil. Judas immediately got up and left the table after he took the bread from Jesus.</p>
<h2>Jesus Foretells Peter’s Denial 13:31-38</h2>
<p>When Judas left, Jesus told the others that now was the time for Him to be glorified. The disciples did not understand what this meant. Some of them might have thought that this was to be the time that Jesus would set Himself up as a ruler over an earthly kingdom and deliver the Jews from the Romans. They did not understand that He was talking about how that He would die, even though He told them before that would.He told them the same thing that He told the Jews, He was going away and they would not be able to follow Him where he was going (heaven). Peter asked Jesus where He was going, but Jesus only told him that he would not be able to follow Him there now and there would come a time when he could follow Him.</p>
<p>Peter objected and insisted that he could and would follow Jesus where ever He went. Peter said that he would even die for Jesus if he had to. Jesus knew that Peter would not keep this promise and He told Peter that before the rooster crowed three times the next morning that he would deny Him three times. As we later read, Jesus’ words proved to be true and we see Peter cursing and swearing to deny that he ever even knew Jesus.</p>
<p>Peter wanted to do right and follow Jesus, but he could not in his own strength even as Paul said in Romans 7:15 that he could not do what he wanted to do and did that he did not want to do. There is power in God to overcome every temptation, but it cannot be found apart from regeneration and dependance upon God. Peter’s problem was that he did not know his own weakness and his need for help from God. When we think we can make it in our own strength we are sure to fail, but if we know that we cannot do it by ourselves then we can see God work miraculously as we believe Him.</p>
