<h1>Chapter 4: He is the Soul Winner</h1>
<h2>Jesus Won the Soul of the Woman at the Well 4:1-30</h2>
<p>Jesus and His disciples left Judea and made a journey to Galilee. The only practical path to take on this journey northward was to go through the country of Samaria. The Samaritans were decedents of people that were placed in this land by Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria during the Assyrian captivity of the Jews. These people intermarried with the Jews that had been left behind to care for the land. This union created the Samaritan people—a people that were half-Jew and half-Gentile. Matthew Henry refers to them as “mongrel Jews...both in blood and religion” because while they abandoned their old idolatry after they entered the land, they only partly adopted the Jewish religion. It was no doubt a hard thing for the Jews to have to make the journey through this country of their enemies and it is possible that some made the option instead to go the long way around the country rather than go through it. Jesus did not only go through this country because it was the most convenient path, but He knew that there were souls that He could help in this foreign country.</p>
<h3>Jesus’ request for physical water 4:1-12</h3>
<p>When they came to the city of Sycar, the disciples left Jesus to go into the city and buy some food. While they were gone, Jesus, who was very much man, sat down on the well to get some rest from physical exhaustion. Though He may have been physically tired He was still spiritually strong and was more than eager to reach out to the lost and win a soul.</p>
<p>A woman of the city came to the well to draw water and Jesus asked her to give Him a drink. This request surprised the woman, because the Jews were so against the Samaritans that they did not ask them for favors. Jesus told the woman that if she only knew the gift of God and to whom she was talking to then she would ask Him for living water. The woman thought He was talking about natural water, but she did not know that Jesus was speaking about spiritual water (7:37-39). She wanted to know how He would be able to get the water out of the well without any kind of vessel.</p>
<h3>Jesus’ promise of spiritual water 4:13-30</h3>
<h4>The Promise to the Woman 4:13-14</h4>
<p>Jesus wanted the woman to know that the spiritual water that He had to offer was much better than the physical water that she could get from the well. If we only seek after the natural things of this world than we will never be satisfied even though we may have great possessions, but if we receive of the things of the Spirit, then they will satisfy our soul and teach us to be content with the things that we have in the natural (Phil. 4:11; Heb. 13:5). When God fills us, He does not just give us just a few drops, but He gives us rivers of living waters flowing from our soul (7:37; Is. 58:11).</p>
<h4>The Confession of the Woman 4:15-19</h4>
<p>The woman was still thinking in the natural and she thought that Jesus hag some kind</p>
<p>of magical water that would make her so she never got thirsty again. She asked Jesus for this water and He told her to go and get her husband. The woman told Jesus that she had no husband. Jesus told the woman that she was correct in saying that she had no husband at that time, but in the past she had fives husbands and now she was living with a man to whom she was not married.</p>
<p>When Jesus asked the woman to bring her husband He knew all these things about her. He was not trying to find out information about her life, but He was looking for a confession of her sin--she had to admit that she was living in adultery. Before God can help us with our sin we must first confess it (Pro. 28:13; I John 1:9).</p>
<p>When the woman heard Jesus tell her all about her life, then she proclaimed that He was a prophet. Revelation is sometimes a progressive work. God may show you part of a thing at one time and then later He will reveal to you the other pieces. This woman understood that Jesus was a prophet, which is true, for Jesus was the Prophet (Acts 3:19-24), but she did not yet realize that He was the Messiah.</p>
<h4>The Argument of the Woman 4:20-24</h4>
<p>Though the woman realized that Jesus was the Prophet, she was trying in her mind to figure out how this Jew could be a messenger of God. The Samaritans used Mt. Gerizim as a place of worship, while the Jews worshipped at Jerusalem. There were certainly other religious differences between the Jews and the Samaritans, and this woman was wondering how God could use a person that believed so differently from what she thought was right.</p>
<p>Jesus helped the woman to understand that it did not matter where a person worshipped, but how a person worshipped--a person must worship God in spirit and in truth. A person must worship God from his heart and not only from his head and they must worship God according to the truth found in the Word of God.</p>
<h4>The Realization of the Woman 4:25-30</h4>
<p>The woman did not really know what to believe about the things that Jesus said those things to her, and she tried to put off dealing with those ideas until a later date. She thought that someday in the far off future that the Messiah would come and He would make known the truth about all things, including the right way to worship. Many people do not want to search out the Scriptures and pray for revelation so that they can understand the truth about certain doctrines of the Bible. They feel that some things are too complicated for us to understand and that we will only know the truth when we get to heaven and speak to God face to face, but we do not have to wait to learn truth for the Divine Teacher can reveal to us all truths is we would only be diligent to listen to His voice.</p>
<p>Jesus proclaimed to the woman that He was this Messiah of whom she spoke. This woman did not only hear the vibrations in her ears when Jesus spoke, but something resonated in her heart that told her that this proclamation was true. Just like when Andrew and Phillip were saved, when this woman encountered Christ, the first thing that she did was run out and tell others about it.</p>
<h2>Jesus Wanted the Disciples to Win Souls 4:31-38</h2>
<p>The disciples returned from the village as Jesus made this proclamation to the</p>
<p>woman. They were probably thinking negative things in their minds because of the nationality of the woman, but none of then dared to speak them. When the woman left, the disciples encouraged Jesus to eat the food that they brought. Jesus told them that He had meat to eat that they knew not of. He was not speaking about physical food, but He was saying that His satisfaction was doing the will of the Father.</p>
<p>It was possibly when Jesus looked up and saw the many Samaritans coming to meet Him that He told the disciples, “Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already unto harvest.” Jesus did not want His disciples to wait until some far off date before they reached out to the lost, but there were many souls ready to receive the Gospel right then. Jesus knew that there were more souls than could be reached by these twelve men and He told them in Matthew 9:38 to pray that God would send more laborers into the harvest field. Jesus did not tell then to complain because others were not helping, but rather to pray that God would work in their hearts and give them the desire to go out and help work in the fields.</p>
<h2>Jesus Won the Souls of Sycar 4:39-42</h2>
<p>There were many people that came to Jesus from the city when they heard the testimony of the woman. When they herd Jesus Himself speak they too believed His words. The testimony of the women led many people to Christ, but it was not her words that changed their lives. Her words only led them to Christ, and He is the only One who can transform a man (4:42).</p>
<h2>Jesus Won the Soul of the Nobleman 4:43-54</h2>
<div class="highlights left">
<h1>#3 Master of Distance</h1>
	<p>When we need to deal with a situation, it is most beneficial for us to be where the problem is. A doctor cannot help a patient unless he is at his bedside. Jesus proved that He is not limited to the boundaries created by distance and healed the boy without ever even stepping in the house where he lay.</p>
</div>
<p>After His two day detour in Samaria, Jesus finally reached His destination of Cana of Galilee. When He arrived there were already people that believed in Him for these people where at Jerusalem when He overthrew the tables of the money changers. There were other men that probably heard the testimony that these men brought back.</p>

<p>One of these men that believed on Jesus was a nobleman from Capernaum that had a son that was dying from a disease. He traveled to Cana to see if Jesus would come and heal his son. Jesus told the man to go home for his son would live. The man believed the words of Jesus.</p>
<p>Vs. 48—The only reason that Jesus performed miracles was so that people would believe. There were many people that were healed during Jesus’ ministry, but not all of them believed. When this son was healed, not only the father believed but the whole house did.</p>
