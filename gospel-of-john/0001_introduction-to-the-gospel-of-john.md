# Introduction

Though this book is often referred to as the Gospel of John, it should be understood that it is better referred to as the Gospel of Jesus Christ According to John since the book is about Jesus and not John. John&apos;s book is not some new doctrine or idea, but it corresponds with the records of the other Gospel writers.

## The Writer of the Gospel

The Gospel of John was written between A.D. 85 and 90 by John the Beloved, the disciple of Jesus. He was born in Bethsaida of Galilee to Zebedee, a fisherman, and Salome, whom some believe to be the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus. He had at least one brother, James, and they both joined their father in his trade of fishing. It was while they were working with their father that they answered the call of Jesus to be fishers of men and be His disciples (Matthew 4:18-22). This John is not to be confused with John the Baptist. John does not use his own name when writing this gospel; instead he refers to himself as &quot;the other disciple&quot; or &quot;the disciple whom Jesus loved.&quot; There is internal evidence that shows that John was the author as we can see from John 21:24, 25.

According to Irenaeus, the pupil of Polycarp, who was a friend and pupil of John, John orally shared the Gospel for sixty years after the Acension. At some time, John was exiled by Domitian, the Roman emperor, to the Island of Patmos as an act of religious persecution. It was there that John received the visions included in the book of Revelation.

Irenaeus also said that after the death of Domitian in A.D. 96 that John returned from exile and settled in Ephesus. It is believed that it was there that the encouragement of friends and the direction of the Holy Spirit induced him to write this Gospel that he had so long been preaching. Nearly a generation after the other Gospels had been written, this Gospel was prepared, which shows that the life and labors of Christ were at this time well known to Christians. In the meantime, the apostles had preached the Gospel, Paul and Peter had suffered martyrdom, and all the apostles had passed to their reward, and Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans. Clement of Alexandria (c.150 - c. 215) says, &quot;Last of all, John, observing that in the other Gospels those things were related that concerned the body of Christ, and being persuaded by his friends, also moved by the Spirit of God, wrote a spiritual Gospel.&quot;

Irenaeus accepted this Gospel and it is quite certain that Justin Martyr used it too. It was combined with the other books of the New Testament in the Diatessaron of Tatian about 170 A.D.

## The Purpose of the Gospel

The purpose of John is stated internally in the Gospel; John 20:30,31 explains that the Gospel is an account of signs that proved that Jesus was the Messiah. The goal of John was that men might believe upon reading the accounts given within its pages.

Throughout the book we find the three key thoughts given here in John 20:30, 31; those thoughts are signs, believing, and life. We see many signs in the book of John that prove that Jesus was the Son of God, these signs produced faith (believing) in Him and His work, and the result was that those that believed received eternal life.

### The Gospel was written that men might see signs

Throughout the book of John we see many different supernatural occurrences that are given as evidence for men to believe in Jesus and His work. Jesus said in Mark 16:17, &quot;Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe&quot; and so He gives many signs to encourage men to believe. While it is possible for men to believe without seeing (John 20:29), the fact remains true that most men will not believe without seeing first. When a man sees these signs a action is demanded&mdash;either he must accept it and believe or else he must reject it and doubt.

The miracles recorded are material witnesses to underlying spiritual truths. There are nine distinct signs in John that prove Jesus to be Master of things that we face every day. Jesus performed many other signs (John 20:30), but these signs are hand-picked to teach a spiritual truth.

What does supplying wine for a marriage have to do with Jesus&apos; mission? It is more than just supplying wine for a wedding, but it is showing the miraculous power of God. In His ability to turn sorrow into joy and also the quality of his work shows that God&apos;s way is best. The testimony that the governor of the feast had about the wine, &quot;thou hast kept the good wine until now&quot;.

These signs prove Him to be the Master.


### The Gospel was written that men might believe

Believing means to trust and personally commit yourself to Christ. It could could also be said that believing is relying on Christ with conviction. The words that involve believing (i.e. faith and believe) are used 98 times in John.

The outcome of destiny is determined by belief and unbelief. The scriptures never demand belief without providing adequate reason for commitment. John 11:40 says, "If thou wouldest believe thou wouldest see the glory of God." Jesus gave Martha and all the disciples many reasons to believe, though demonstrating who He is by many signs. The Master of every situation demonstrated fully His adequacy for all human emergencies. The Resurrection was the crowning sign of all since it proved that Jesus not only had the power to raise other men from the dead, but He was also able to revive Himself.

### The Gospel was written that men might have life

When men see the signs and believe in them, then life is given. This life is more than natural life, but it is spiritual life&mdash;the life of Christ. This life is a restored fellowship between God and man (17:3), which was lost when Adam disobeyed God by eating the forbidden fruit. There are many references to this spiritual life in the Gospel of John, including 3:16; 3:36; 4:14; 5:24; 6:47; 8:12; 10:10; 11:25 and 12:25.

## The Style of the Gospel

The style of this Gospel is simple, but the thought is profound. Its great design is to set forth the divinity of our Lord as the basis of faith, and to meet the spiritual needs, not of a particular class (i.e. Jew, Roman, or Greek), but of all men and hence it is called &quot;the spiritual Gospel,&quot; and &quot;the Gospel for the Church.&quot; Gregory Nazianzen (c. 329&ndash;c.390) says, &quot;Matthew wrote the wonderful works of Christ for the Jew, Mark for the Roman, Luke for the Greeks, John, a herald, who reaches the very heavens for all.&quot;

We have already noted the purpose (But these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through His name) and this purpose shapes the style of the Gospel. It's focus on producing faith in the heart of men is why John does not record many details of Christ's life, but rather focuses on salvation. For example, he does not mention the facts concerning the birth and early life of Jesus or a genealogy of His family, but instead declares, &quot;in the beginning was the Word.&quot; This is also why instead of parabolic teaching, this Gospel contains the great spiritual discourses that do not appear in the Synoptic Gospels.

## A Summary of the Gospel

This Gospel presents a series of pictures, in each of which Christ is the Central Figure. Each of the 21 Chapters contains a striking portrayal of some aspect of the character or work of the Savior.

CHAPTER ONE: He is the Son of God. His deity is portrayed in verse one (in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God) and in verse fourteen (and we beheld His glory, the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth).

CHAPTER TWO: He is the Son of Man. Here we have a scene illustrating His perfect humanity. He appears as a guest at the marriage in Cana of Galilee where He mingles with men in their social activities.
