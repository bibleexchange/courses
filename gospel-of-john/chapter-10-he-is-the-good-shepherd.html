<h1>Chapter 10: He is the Good Shepherd</h1>
<p>In this chapter Jesus reveals to the people the concept that He is the leader of the flock of Israel, and then He goes on to explain more details of the idea and even shows how that they are not following their true leader. The idea of God being the shepherd of men is not an idea that is solely found in the tenth chapter of John, but it is a doctrine found in several other verses, including the very famous 23rd Psalm.</p>
<h2>The Illustration of the Doctrine of the Good Shepherd 10:1-6</h2>
<p>This chapter starts with Jesus telling the people a parable that illustrates that He is the Good Shepherd. The illustration points out the difference between the thief and the shepherd--the thief will sneak in by climbing over the wall to try to steal the sheep, while the shepherd can openly and honestly enter the sheepfold and retrieve his possessions. The sheep will hear the voice of the shepherd and know to follow him. In these ancient days of the Middle East, shepherds did not drive sheep as many people do with cattle, but he spent time with the sheep and they learned the sound of his voice, knew that it was safe to obey his commands, and they followed him as he lead them. On the other hand, if the sheep were not familiar with the voice that was commanding them, then you would not see them follow after the stranger. No thief could pretend to be the shepherd and try to lead them away, for they would become afraid and try to run away.</p>
<h2>The Explanation of the Doctrine of the Good Shepherd 10:7-21</h2>
<h3>The Sheep-door 10:7-9</h3>
<p>It is said that in ancient times that the sheepfold was a stone wall with a single door, to which several shepherds would bring their flocks for the night. One of the shepherds or another hired man would act as a guard and porter to make sure that no one entered the sheep fold that did not belong there. It is even said that one of the shepherds would sleep in front of the door, that way if anyone tried to enter, they would have to step over him and risk waking him up from sleep.</p>
<p>Jesus said He is that door of the sheepfold and He made this point very clear. He is the only true passage to having the salvation of God (John 14:6). There were many other men that arose before Jesus that proclaimed to be a Messiah or to know a new way to God, but Jesus said all these men were “thieves and robbers.” If a man was truly following God, then they were not deceived by such false prophets. Even today there are many men that proclaim to know the way to God as they introduce some new doctrine or idea, but we need to have a close relationship with God so that we are not lead astray by these false men of God.</p>
<p>If we enter into the flock of God through the straight and narrow way of the salvation of Jesus Christ, then we can know that we are truly saved. It is in this place of abiding in Him that we find pasture. Like David says in the 23rd Psalm, that the Shepherd will cause us to not have want of anything because He supplies all of our needs as He makes us “to lie down in green pastures” (Psalm 23:2).</p>
<h3>The Shepherd 10:10-15</h3>
<p>Jesus then goes on to enlighten the people about His parable by explaining whom the characters in it represent. There is the shepherd and there are the strangers whom the sheep do not know.</p>
<h4>The Bad Shepherds (the strangers)</h4>
<p>Thieves 10:10a--he comes to kill, steal, and destroy the sheep. Without a doubt this is referring to the devil, who has been the enemy of the flock of God since the beginning when he deceived the first woman into sinning against the command of God. Satan has always has, and still is seeking to destroy the souls of men.</p>
<p>Hirelings 10:12-13--hired hands that care only for money and not the work itself. There have been many so called “men of God” that have entered the ministry for the perk benefits. These men only care about the sheep for personal gain such as offerings and paid-parsonages. God speaks against these false shepherds in Ezekiel 34:2–3, where it says, “...Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.” These men have no real backbone, and when the trial comes, then they run away to save their own lives.</p>

<li>
<p>He is clearly Christ 10:11a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He laid down His life for the sheep 10:11b</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a relationship between Him and the sheep 10:14</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a relationship between Him and the Father 10:15</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Sheep 10:16-21</h3>
<h4>The flock contains more than the Jews. At this time, in the minds of the Hebrew, it was almost impossible for a Gentile to be saved, but Jesus explained that there would come a time when both Jews and Gentiles would be united together in one body--we know that body to be the church.</h4>
<h4>The flock contains wayward sheep that do not believe in Jesus. After Jesus had said these things, there were some men that called Him insane and said that He was demon possessed. There are many people in churches that do not really believe in Jesus. They follow man’s ideas and have a form of religion and yet they deny and contradict Christ every day with ways that are not pleasing to God.</h4>
<h2>The Application of the Doctrine of the Good Shepherd 10:22-42</h2>
<p>Two months had passed since Jesus declared that He was the Water of Life during the final day of the Feast of Tabernacles. It is now the feast of dedication, or more commonly to us today, Hanukkah. The New Manners and Customs of the Bible by J. M. Freeman and J. H. Chadwick explains to us a little about the feast and its origin:</p>
<blockquote>This was a feast instituted in honor of the restoration of divine worship in the temple, and its formal rededication to sacred uses after it had been defiled by the heathen under Antiochus Epiphanes. This dedication took place in 164 b.c., and an account of it is given in the apocryphal book 1 Maccabees 4:52–59. The feast lasted two days, and could be celebrated not only in Jerusalem, but elsewhere. In later times it was known by the name of the “Feast of Lamps,” or the “Feast of Lights,” because of the custom of illuminating the houses while celebrating it. The Jewish rabbis have a tradition that, when the Jews under Judas Maccabeus drove the heathen out of the temple and cleansed it from its pollution, they found a solitary bottle of sacred oil that had escaped the profane search of the heathen. This was all they had for lighting the sacred lamps, but by a miracle this was made to last eight days, and so this became the duration of the feast. This is the holiday referred to now as Hanukkah, an eight-day festival beginning on the twenty-fifth day of Kislev.</blockquote>
<p>It was during this feast that the Jewish religious leaders came to Jesus while He walked on Solomon’s Porch in the temple and asked Him this question, “How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly” (John 10:24). Jesus reminded them that He already told them (John 5:36) that His works proved who He was.</p>
<p>Jesus said the reason that they did not believe was because they were not His sheep. Jesus said that His sheep would hear His voice and by so saying, He also inferred that those that were not His sheep would not here His voice. Now we see the words of Jesus fulfilled-¬later we see them fulfilled even more as He lays down His life for the sheep (John 10:15).</p>
