<h1>Chapter 11: He is the Resurrection and the Life</h1>
<h2>The Request for Jesus 11:1-16</h2>
<h3>The sisters’ request that Jesus come to pray for Lazarus 11:1-6</h3>
<p>There was a family in the town of Bethany that had grown quite close to Jesus. This family consisted of three siblings: Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus to hear what he had to say (Luke 10:39) and later poured precious ointment on the feet of Jesus and then cleaned his feet with her hair (12:3), Martha, who was older than Mary and scolded her when she sat and listened to Jesus instead of helping her serve (Luke 10:40), and Lazarus, who was known of as the friend of Jesus (11:11).</p>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter, we see Lazarus fall ill with a deadly disease and his sisters send a request to Jesus in Bethabara that He would come help him before he died. When Jesus received the message He said, “This sickness is not unto death...” Jesus knew that Lazarus would die, but He also knew that that would not be the end of His friend.</p>
<p>Jesus also said that the disease was “for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.” The miracles that Jesus performed were so that men would glorify God and believe in Him (5:23) and this miracle was more than others that Jesus performed because Lazarus would be dead for four days, then there would be no doubt that his resurrection was by the power of God. Jesus did not immediately respond to the message, nor did He hurry to travel to Bethany, but He tarried where He was for two more days.</p>
<h3>The disciples’ request that Jesus stay away from Jerusalem 11:7-16</h3>
<p>After the two days, Jesus encouraged His disciples to make the journey with Him west to where Lazarus was. The disciples tried to convince Jesus not to go near Judea since the rulers of the Jews wanted to kill Him (10:31, 39). They were probably not only afraid that something would happen to Jesus, but they were also fearful that they too would suffer persecution for being associated with him.</p>
<p>Jesus responded by giving them an illustration of how the limitation the twelve hours or the day restrict when a man can work. When those twelve hours are over, then darkness is come and no one can work. He was trying to help them understand that He was given a certain ammount of time from the Father to complete His work on earth. Jesus knew that He was in His eleventh hour and could not cease to do the work of God because of fear or discourageent.</p>
<p>He then told them another reason for wanting to go, Lazarus was sleeping and He wanted to go and wake him up. He was not talking about actual sleep, but the deep sleep of death. The discilples thought it was a good thing if he was sleeping; he should be left alone so that he might get rest and recover. Jesus then told them plainly that, “Lazarus is dead.”</p>
<p>The next words of Jesus come as a surprise to us as He says, “And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there...” At first glance it sound as if Jesus is happy that Lazarus is dead, but the next statement explains the motive of Jesus as He says, “to the intent ye may believe.” Jesus knew that Lazarus could be healed whether He went right away or four days after he was already dead, but He also knew that it would be a greater testimony to the disciples if Lazarus was not merely healed from sickness but rather raised from the dead. Doctors could perform cures on people, but only One anointed by God could raise the dead.</p>
<p>Thomas, who is known as the doubter because he later refused to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead, makes one of the few statements that we have recorded of him saying. He told the disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” Though we see some doubt in his statement because he thought that Jesus would then be put to death, we also see some faith--he was willing to die with Christ. He knew that it was better to die with Him than to live without Him.</p>
<h2>The Reasoning of the Sisters 11:17-32</h2>
<p>As we stated when we studied chapter seven, the natural mind cannot understand the things of God and many times God will do things in a way that is contrary to how we would do it. We see Martha and Mary try to explain to Jesus how they thought things would have been better if He had only done things the way they wanted.</p>
<h3>The reasoning of Martha 11:17-27</h3>
<h4>She thought Jesus was too late 11:17-22</h4>
<p>When Martha heard that Jesus had come to town, she went out to meet Him. The first thing that she said was that if Jesus had only come sooner then her brother would not have died. They called for Him to come in time enough and save their brother, but Jesus failed (at least they thought) to come and help. Many times we out a time restriction on God and He does not work within our expectations we think He has forgotten us or does not care about us. We must understand that God’s ways are not our ways and we must believe in Him for the promise even if every natural element says that it is impossible.</p>
<h4>She thought the resurrection was far away 11:23, 24</h4>
<p>Jesus then told Martha that her brother would live again and she responded that she knew at the end of time there would be a resurrection and he would arise. She did believe in resurrection, but she did not believe it was for her time. Many people believe in the promises of God, but they do not believe that they will see them fulfilled in their life time.</p>
<h4>She believed Jesus was the Messiah 11:25-27</h4>
<p>Jesus told her that He was that resurrection of which she spoke. If any man believes in Him than they can have everlasting life, which means they would never die. This is spiritual life that He is speaking about, and not just natural life. If we believe in Him then our inner man can lives for ages after our bodies are laid in the ground. By giving physical life to a body He proved that He could also give spiritual life to a soul.</p>
<p>Jesus asked Martha if she believed the things that He said, and she responded that she did believe that He was the Messiah and the Son of God. This is her faith taking hold and gaining victory over her natural mind. Her mind told her that there was no hope for her brother, but her soul was able to depend on the Christ to make her brother alive agin.</p>
<h3>The reasoning of Mary 11:28-32</h3>
<p>When word came that Jesus arrived in town, Mary stayed in the house with the mourners while Martha went out to meet Him. This is possibly because she felt hurt because Jesus did not make haste to come heal her brother. After talking with Jesus, Martha returned home to tell her sister that the Master had come and that He wanted to see her. When Mary heard that Jesus was specifically calling for her, she got up and immediately went to see him.</p>
<p>Mary’s initial complaint to Jesus was the same as Martha’s and she said while weeping, “If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.” She too felt that God could only work during certain times and it seemed that Jesus did not care enough to help her brother.</p>
<h2>The Resurrection of Lazarus 11:33-44</h2>
<h3>Jesus wept 11:33-37</h3>
<p>It moved Jesus when He saw this woman weeping for her late brother and “He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.” He then asked to be brought to the tomb and when He saw it, He wept. Some people believe that Jesus wept because He was sad that Lazarus had died, and this is what those that were watching that day thought. This argument is not very valid for we know that Jesus knew that Lazarus would soon be raised to life and thus He had no need to lament for him. Another time when Jesus wept, He was interceding because man was not believing in God (Luke 19:41-44) and that is the reason here. There were men there that day doubting and asking why Jesus could not have saved Lazarus when He was able to help other people. Jesus was not weeping for Lazarus, but because the people, including Martha and Mary, did not have the faith to see Lazarus return to the living.</p>
<h3>Jesus commanded the stone be removed 11:38-42</h3>
<p>Jesus told the people to remove the stone away that sealed the grave. He wanted them to remove every hinderance and stumbling block of their faith that hindered them from believing for the resurrection of Lazarus. They had put the stone in the way and were thus surrendering Lazarus to death, and before they could see Him come alive they had to remove the obstacle they placed in the way. Before God can work miracles in our lives we must get rid of carnal thoughts that hinder Him from moving.</p>
<p>Martha quickly objected to the stone being removed and reminded Him that Lazarus had been dead for four days and that the tomb was sure to reek with the stench of his decaying body. Jesus rebuked her for her doubt and reminded her that He told her that she would see the glory of God if she would believe.</p>
<p>When the stone was removed, Jesus lifted up His eyes to heaven and prayed to the Father. He knew that God always heard and honored His prayers, so He was not looking for something to increase His own faith, but He wanted the people to see a sign that proved that He was the Resurrection and the Life.</p>
<h3>Jesus called Lazarus out of the grave 11:43-44</h3>

<p>After He prayed, Jesus cried for Lazarus to come forth. Death had no other choice but to loosen its hold on Lazarus when Jesus spoke and we see that he comes stumbling out of the grave still bound in the grave clothes.</p>
<p>Jesus then commanded the people to remove the grave clothes from off of him. This was something the people had to do and not Jesus--since it was them that bound him they had to be the ones to unbind him. Their doubt left him in the grave and now they must take action and believe to see him walk among the living again.</p>
<h2>The Retribution of the Jews 11:45-57</h2>

<div class="highlights">
	<h1>#8 Master of Death</h1>
	<p>When the Master spoke, death had no choice but to let go of Lazarus. For us, death is so final, but with God not even death is final!</p>
	
	<p>Christ&apos;s own resurrection was the crowning sign of all.</p>

<p>Because of this miracle, many that were present now believed on Jesus, but there were others that did not believe and they ran to tell the Pharisees what happened so that they might quence it. The Pharisees told the priests, whom assembled together to discuss what they should do about Jesus. They were afraid that if they let Jesus alone to keep preaching, teaching, and healing people, then many more people would believe and the Romans would surely hear about it. The Romans would undoubtedly consider it a zealote revolt against the Roman Emporor and come in and press more restrictions on the people. The priests and other religious leaders would lose their positions and the whole nation might face expulsion or even slaughter.</p>
<p>Caiaphas, the high priest for the year, made a speech and He said that it important that One Man die instead of the whole nation. Whether he knew it or not, he was not speaking out of his own understanding, but he was prophecying the words of God. It was necessary that Jesus die so that the whole world and not just Judea should be free from death. The Jews might have been the tool that God used to put Jesus on the cross but the idea did not initiate from them themselves. God had a plan formed from before the foundation of the world that Jesus would die for humanity (Rev. 13:8).</p>
<p>Because of what they already said and because of Caiaphas’ prophecy, the preists decided that the only thing option they had was to put Jesus to death. The Passover was approaching and they knew from the past that Jesus always attended the Jewish feasts, so they prepared to catch Him during this time when He would be in Jerusalem. They gave a commandment and spread the message that if anyone should see Jesus, then they must report Him to the religious leaders.</p>
<p>Jesus knew that His time to die was approahing, but it was not quite time yet. Because of this, Jesus did not openly walk among the Jews, but He went into the city of Ephraim. Jesus did everything for a reason and He had a purpose for going to this city. He was doing more than just seeking rest from persecution, but He was doing the will of the Father and protecting the disciples and preparing them for what was to come ahead. This place was not too far from where He had been tempted of the devil, and perhaps He was trying to get His disciples ready to face the hard temptations that would come as they see their Master arrested, falsely accused, and hung on the cross. It was also nearby where Joshua fought his first hard battle in the Promised Land and Jesus might have wanted the twelve to be ready to fight the hardest battle that they ever would fight.</p>
