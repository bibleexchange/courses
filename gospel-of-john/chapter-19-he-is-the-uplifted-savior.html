<h1>Chapter 19: He is the Uplifted Savior</h1>
<p>In this chapter we see Jesus become obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. He could have easily manifested His power and saved Himself that day, but if He saved Himself He would have also condemned humanity. He knew that His death was the only way to pay for the sins of men and set them free.</p>
<h2>The Sentence 18:1-16</h2>
<h3>The King of Jews Accused 18:1-6</h3>
<p>Scourging: Jesus was stripped and beaten with a whip. This was a savage, excruciating punishment. The whip was made of leather straps, at least two pieces made of rough lead, sharp bones or spikes, so that they would cut deeply into the flesh. Jesus' hands were tied to a post above His head as He was scourged. It was the Roman custom for the prisoner to be lashed by the presiding centurion until He was near death (Jewish trials allowed only forty lashes). Jesus' back was, of course, nothing more than an unrecognizable mass of torn flesh.</p>
<p>The Roman soldiers heard that Jesus was supposedly King of the Jews and they wanted to make some sport out of the claim. They made a crown out of braided thorns and put on Him a purple robe, which is the color of royalty. They mocked Him and hit Him as they cried in jest, “Hail, King of the Jews!” What they did not realize that He was in truth the King of the Jews and even more He was the King of Kings (Dan. 2:37; I Tim. 6:15; Rev. 17:14).</p>
<p>Pilate brought Jesus before the people and declared, “Behold the man!” The crowd, which probably consisted of people that had heard Jesus speak or knew someone that had been healed by Him, now cried out for Him to be crucified. The choice of what to do with Him had been put in the hands of the people and they chose to crucify Him.We have also been given a choice--we can reject Him or we can receive Him. What will you do with Him?</p>
<h3>The Son of God Refused 18:7-16</h3>
<p>The Jews told Pilate that Jesus proclaimed to be the Son of God, and that act of blasphemy was why He was worthy of death. This frightened Pilate, for up to this point he thought that Jesus only proclaimed to be King of the Jews--it was a much different thing to proclaim yourself to be the Son of God. He brought Jesus back into the judgment hall and asked Him if the accusations of the Jews was true, but Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate tried to threaten Jesus into speaking by reminding Him that He had the power to chose to crucify or release Him. Jesus answered and told him that he had no power to do anything unless it was given him by God. We must remember that all the events that happened that night were of the will of God. Jesus was going to die on the cross not because man chose to put Him there, but it happened because it was God’s divine plan for Jesus to die for the sins of man.</p>
<p>Pilate brought Jesus before the Jews one more time to try to get them to convince them of His innocence, but the Jews insisted that Pilate would not be in good standing with Caesar if he let Jesus go, for Jesus committed insurrection by making Himself a king. This probably shook Pilate, but he still tried to get the Jews to drop their charges against Jesus. He asked them if they really wanted to crucify their king, and the Jews responded that Caesar alone was their king. Pilate was surly afraid that he would be accused of trying to overthrow the Roman authority in the land if he tried to help Jesus any more, so he sent Him away to be crucified. Pilate believed in Jesus to an extent otherwise he would not have fought for Him at all, but it was not a true faith, for if it was, he would have been willing to sacrifice not only his position as governor, but also his life.</p>
<h2>The Crucifixion 18:17-30</h2>
<h3>The inscription on the cross 18:17-24</h3>
<p>Pilate wrote a sign to be hung on the cross so that people would know who He was and what “crime” he had done. This inscription read, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews” and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin so that it could be read by everyone present. The Jews were bothered by this sign and they went to Pilate and insisted that it should read something to the effect of, “Jesus of Nazareth, who called himself King of the Jews” since they did not believe that He was their king. Pilate refused to make the change and told them that what he wrote would remain there. This was probably because of the slight belief that he had in Jesus.</p>
<p>After the soldiers stripped Jesus and hung Him on the cross, they took his clothes as a spoil. They parted His robe into four pieces at the seams--one for each soldier that helped hang Him on the cross. They then were going to divide His outer coat, but since it had no seams to easily divide it, they chose to cast lots to see who would take the whole thing. This was done in fulfillment of the prophecy given in Psalm 22:18.</p>
<h3>The mourners at the foot of the cross 18:25-27</h3>
<p>At the foot of the cross, there gathered a group to mourn to death of Jesus. This group</p>
<p>consisted of John the disciple and several women, including the mother of Jesus.</p>
<h3>The final words from the cross 18:28-30</h3>
<h2>The Burial 18:31-42</h2>
<h3>Not a bone broken 18:31-37</h3>
<blockquote>Psalm 34:20 He keepeth all his bones: Not one of them is broken.</p>
<p>Zechariah 12:10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, The spirit of grace and of supplications: And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, And they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, And shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.</blockquote>
<h3>Body taken care of by friends 18:38-42</h3>
<p>The secret’s out! Joseph of Arimathaea was a good and honorable man and a member of the Jewish council, but he did not agree with the decisions that they made concerning Jesus (Luke 23:50, 51). Though he believed in Jesus and disagreed with the Jews, he did not openly confess this faith in the Son of God because he feared losing his reputation and being persecuted by the Jews. Joseph had tried to be a secret disciple, but now came a time when he realized that he had to make an open declaration of allegiance to Christ. He did it in the most conspicuous way as he went to the governor and asked for the body of Jesus. If we are going to serve Christ, we are going to have to do it openly and with full confidence no matter what others may do to us or think about us. If we are ashamed of Him, then He will be ashamed of us (Mark 8:38).</p>
<p>Nicodemus (the same as in chapters three and seven) is another one that up to this point had not made an outright declaration to serve Jesus, and yet now we see him join in with Joseph in the preparation of the body for burial. He brought the spices needed to prepare the body and, with Joseph, he laid the body in the tomb. The tomb was a cave hewn out of a wall of rock that had a large round stone that would be rolled in front of the opening to prevent people from tampering with the body. This was Joseph’s own tomb that he had recently prepared for the day that he himself would die, but now he gave it to the One whom he believed (Matt. 27:60). </p>
