<h1>Chapter 5: He is the Divine Healer</h1>
<h2>An Example of Jesus&apos; Healing Power 5:1-18</h2>
<h3>The Problem 5:1-5</h3>
<p>John chapter five opens up with Jesus returning to Jerusalem to attend &ldquo;a feast of the Jews.&rdquo; It is thought by many that this &ldquo;feast&rdquo; was the Passover, but there is no evidence to either concretely prove or disprove that theory. It was during this trip to the Holy City that Jesus visited the pool named Bethesda, which is by the sheep gate (it is translated sheep market in the KJV, but it almost certainly referring to the gate built by Eliashib and his family when Jerusalem was rebuilt as told in Nehemiah 3:1). This pool had a legend behind it that at a certain time in the year an angel would come down from heaven and stir the water; once the water was troubled the first person that got into the water was healed of any diseases they possessed. This occurrence was not simply a fairy tale or hoax, but the divinely inspired writer of the Scripture wrote it as a fact, and it is possible that he had known someone personally that had been healed in years past by making it first into the pool. The name Bethesda means &ldquo;house [or place] of mercy&rdquo; and is likely named so because of all the miraculous cures wrought there by the mercy of God.</p>
<p>Underneath the five porches that surrounded this pool there gathered a multitude of people vexed with every disease imaginable. These people all wanted to be healed and at the time of troubling of the water they certainly all selfishly pushed and fought to try to capture the coveted prize of rejuvenation. It was in the midst of this crowd of impotent folk that there lay a certain man that had been sick for thirty-eight years. We do not know what disease he had or for how long the disease had rendered him bedridden, but we do know that when Jesus came to the pool that he was unable to move about without the help of another man.</p>
<h3>The Promise 5:6-9</h3>
<p>With the vast amount of people waiting to be healed, it is hard with the natural mind to figure out why Jesus singled out this man instead of healing the whole crowd. It is quite possible that Jesus knew that the others would not respond to a simple command of faith and that they were too wrapped up in the wonder of this sensational yearly miracle to be bothered with anything else. Many people are still this way; they look forward to special meetings and conventions when there is great moving of the spirit and yet they do not realize that they can receive help at any time if they would only respond to the Word of God.</p>
<p>Because He is the omniscient Son of God, Jesus did not have to interrogate the man to find out his history, but He already knew all about him and the fact of how that he had been sick for thirty-eight years. Upon seeing the man, Jesus asked him, &ldquo;Wilt thou be made whole?&rdquo; This might have seemed like a strange question, for why else would the man lie there year after year if he did not desire to be healed? The man responded with the best answer he could give from his carnal mind, &ldquo;Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus gave him a promise that surpassed all attempts of human reasoning; that was &ldquo;Rise.&rdquo; He was telling him that he now could do the thing he couldn’t do before--and it was all because Jesus had spoken the word. The same voice that was able to create the world out of nothing now spoke to recreate the parts of this man’s body that had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Jesus proceeded, &ldquo;Take up thy bed and walk.&rdquo; This was a challenge to the man’s will to arise to action. He had to personally respond to what Jesus said. He had to walk for himself; he was to no longer expect another man to carry him around. The basis of a miracle is the exercising of the will. </p>

<h1>#4 Master of Time</h1>
	<p>Often we put time frames on things and say that God HAS to work in them or else things will not work out right (such as Martha in John 11:21), but Jesus proved that though this man had been sick for nearly four decades, there was still time for him to be healed.</p>

<h3>The Persecution 5:10-13</h3>
<p>The Jews were very upset because Jesus healed this man on the Sabbath day, because according to the Law, no work at all was to be done on the Sabbath (Ex. 20:8-11). The punishment for breaking this law was death (Ex. 31:14-17) and the Jews wanted to execute this judgment (4:16).</p>
<p>What the Jews did not understand was that the Sabbath was given as a part of the ceremonial law, which was fulfilled in Christ (Col. 2:16, 17). Jesus is the Sabbath for our souls (Heb. 4:9-11) and the principle behind the Sabbath was for men to cease from their own labor and rest in the provision of God.</p>
<h3>The Precept 5:14-18</h3>
<p>One of the first things the man did after he was healed was to go to the temple to worship God. When God helps us and works on our behalf, we need to give Him thanks.</p>
<p>Jesus found the man in the temple and said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, thou art made whole: Sin no more Lest a worse thing come unto thee.&rdquo; God can help us and drive back the power of the devil from our life, but if we sin, there is no guarantee that that power of darkness will not return to our lives if we go back and sin. When God saves us, He frees us from the power of sin, but we still retain our free will and if we desire to go back to the bondage of sin God will not stop us.</p>

<h2>The Explanation of Jesus’ Healing Power</h2>

<p>This chapter is dealing with a period of controversy. In this chapter, His miracle is attacked and the Divinity of the Saviour is attacked.</p>

<h3>The authority behind Jesus’ power 5:19-30</h3>
<h4>Authority given by God 5:19-23</h4>
<p>Jesus knew that unless He had power granted to Him from God, then He could not perform such miracles. He did not do His own thing, but He as united in mind and spirit with the Father and He only did the things that the Father would do.</p>
<h4>Authority proven by resurrection 5:24-30</h4>
<h3>The witnesses of Jesus’ power 5:31-47</h3>
<p>Jesus knew that His words alone were not enough grounds for someone to believe in His power and authority, so He said, &ldquo;If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.&rdquo; Hebrew Law required at least two witnesses for any matter to be established (Deut. 19:15); Jesus continued to give them a list of four witnesses that established His power and authority that gave Him the divine right to heal the man even on the Sabbath.</p>
<h4>John the Baptist 5:31-35</h4>
<p>Repeatedly John the Baptist had told the Jews that Jesus was &ldquo;the Lamb of God.&rdquo; Jesus said that they at first &ldquo;were willing for a season to rejoice in his light,&rdquo; but they were not wiling to continue in that light.</p>
<h4>The works of Jesus 5:36 The fact that Jesus could even perform miracles of healing was evidence that He was the Son of God. Anyone could say that they could heal a person, but it takes the power of God to perform such a miracle.</h4>
<h4>God the Father 5:37-44</h4>
<p>Perhaps the greatest witness of Jesus’ power was God Himself. The problem was, the Jews did not have any open communication with God; if they did, they would then without a doubt know that Jesus was whom He said He was.</p>
<h4>Moses the Lawgiver 5:45-47</h4>
<p>Jesus gave them one last witness--the scrolls of the Law and Prophets which they studied so much. He said, &ldquo;Search the scriptures...they are they which testify of me.&rdquo; Hebrews 10:7 says that, &ldquo;In the volume of the book it is written of [Jesus]&rdquo; and Jesus told them that day that if they had believed the words of Moses with their hearts, then they would believe on Him for Moses wrote of Him. Repeatedly in the Pentateuch there are types that point to Jesus (i.e. the ram caught in the thicket, the brazen serpent, the tabernacle, and many more) and if they sought to understand these things with a pure heart, God would have opened their understanding so that without a doubt they would know that Jesus was real.</p>
