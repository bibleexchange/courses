<h1>Chapter 3: He is the Divine Teacher</h1>
<p>Throughout the stages of time the Jewish people had been accustomed to the scholastic way as a part of life. According to Baker’s Evangelical Dictionary, in Jewish culture around the time of Christ “male children between the ages of five and twenty usually attended synagogue schools and were trained in the Torah, the Mishnah, and the Talmud.” In this atmosphere of strong emphasis on education, it is only natural that there should also be strong emphasis on educators--as can be seen because the Talmud (Avot) repeatedly reinstates the importance of the teacher in this learning process. We see from Luke 20:46 that these religious teachers were quite respected by the average person (Scribes are specifically mentioned in the passage, but without doubt the Rabbis shared in at least some of this respect). Though man had been accustomed to the natural teachers, they had not yet encountered the divine teacher--Jesus Christ. His knowledge was not acquired by lectures and book learning, but it was ingrained in Him for He was the omniscient Son of God. It was this supreme knowledge that made Him the greatest teacher ever.</p>
<h2>Interview with Nicodemus 3:1-21</h2>
<h3>Jesus &amp; Nicodemus—Face to Face 3:1-3</h3>
<p>There is no record of Jesus publicly teaching before John chapter three, but it can be assumed that He did for He had gained a reputation of being “a teacher sent from God” and it was this reputation that one night drew a man named Nicodemus to ask Him questions. Nicodemus was a man of position in his community—he was referred to as a man of the Pharisees, a ruler of the Jews (John 3:1) and a master (or teacher; instructor) of Israel (John 3:10). We see him fulfill the role as a religious leader in John chapter seven where he participates in a council meeting of the Pharisees (John 7:45-52).</p>
<p>Most believe that Nicodemus came to Jesus by night because he was afraid of persecution from his fellow religious leaders (this coincides with the fact that in both John 7:50-51 and 19:39 that while it is clear that he believed in Jesus, he still did not make a clear public confession), though others argue that it was full moon at the time that he came to Jesus and thus he was not really hidden by the dark and was not concerned with whether people saw him with Jesus or not but that he only came at that time because he had opportunity while the crowds were away sleeping. All three times when Nicodemus is mentioned in Scripture this fact that he came by night to Jesus is mentioned; this added emphasis to this fact gives support to the theory that he did it out of fear of being seen rather than convenience, though the other theory is still possible.</p>
<p>Nicodemus may have come in fear, but however he came this fact is true--he did come; this reveals his desire to know Jesus. He addressed Him with respect by calling Him Rabbi, which means my master and is used as title of honor. He continued on and said, “We know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him” (John 3:2). The fact that he said “we” instead of “I” indicates that at least one other person had confided with Nicodemus that they also believed that Jesus was a teacher from God (John Wesley believed that it might have even been other leaders and Pharisees). Although it is not explained in the Scripture, it is possible that these other people may have even elected Nicodemus to be the spokes person to find out if Jesus was real.</p>
<p>Nicodemus knew that Jesus had performed miracles—this is interesting because until this time there is only record of one miracle that Jesus performed. It is possible that Nicodemus had heard exaggerated rumors of what Jesus had done or else he attributed Jesus’ glorious baptism and triumphant cleansing of the temple as miracles performed by Him. These miracles were enough proof for him to acknowledge that Jesus was sent by God. The fact that Nicodemus believed that Jesus was a teacher sent by God does not mean that he realized that Jesus was actually the Son of God; he was more or less only comparing Jesus to a prophet or other oracle of God. His mind had not yet been opened up to the spiritual realm and was thus trying to figure out who Jesus was according to what he understood in the natural realm. Jesus’ response to Nicodemus’ statement was, “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Jesus knew of Nicodemus’ blindness to the spiritual world and told him of the one and only remedy—spiritual birth.</p>
<h3>Jesus &amp; Nicodemus—Mind to Mind 3:4-12</h3>
<p>Nicodemus was puzzled by this response; he thought that Jesus wanted him to crawl inside of his mother’s womb and be born again naturally. He was right that the physical man could not be born again, but what he did not realize was that the spiritual man can be born again—he can be completely regenerated. This regeneration only takes place by the water (the Word of God—Psalm 119:9; Eph. 5:26) and the Spirit. You must understand “that which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;” That is, there is a significant difference between what we see in the physical world and that that is in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Now we see Jesus give Nicodemus a beautiful illustration in verse eight—You cannot understand the blowing of the wind, but you obey the law and gain its force; so it is with the Spirit. Do not postpone the new birth experience because of intellectual struggle. Obey the law of the wind, and the wind obeys you. Obey the law of the Spirit, and you will know the new birth. To this illustration Nicodemus again displayed unbelief as he said, “How can these things be?” He was a man that had been taught all the ways of religion, knew of all the commandments of the law and prophets, heard all the promises of God, and was well versed in all of these things enough to be a teacher of them and yet he still did not know the true meaning of it all. As Jesus said, he “receive[d] not our witness” (3:11). This is pure evidence that religion alone is not enough to save a man. Jesus used the natural illustration of wind to explain the life in the Spirit and Nicodemus did not understand; Jesus knew that if He outright told Him of heavenly things then he definitely would not understand.</p>
<h3>Jesus &amp; Nicodemus—Heart to Heart 3:13-21</h3>
<p>A good teacher will try to help His pupil to understand what he is saying even though it may take some extra effort. Jesus knew that Nicodemus could not fully understand the secrets of heaven, and yet out of love He continued to explain to him the plan of salvation hoping that Nicodemus would realize that the One that could open up his understanding was the same One to whom he was speaking.</p>
<p>Jesus explains how salvation comes to a man--it is not by works or religion, but it came down from heaven.</p>
<p>From this passage we do not see what Nicodemus’ final response was to Jesus’ exhortation on salvation, but from the afore mentioned passages of John 7:50-51 and 19:39 that it is quite obvious that Nicodemus at least partially grasped that Jesus was the Son of God—the Divine Teacher who alone knows the Words of eternal life.</p>
<h2>Endorsement from John 3:22-36</h2>
<p>After Jesus’ conversation with Nicodemus He left the city of Jerusalem in Judea and went with His disciples into wilderness outside of the city where He baptized people (though it was actually His disciples that did the baptizing upon His command and authority and not He Himself—John 4:2); at this same time, John the Baptist was baptizing in Aenon. John’s disciples (men that knew John, believed in his ministry, and had been influenced by his ministry) came to John and asked him about Jesus. They knew that John bare witness of Christ and proclaimed Him to be the Lamb of God, and yet they were bothered that Jesus was moving into John’s ministry of baptism.</p>
<p>John reassured them that if Jesus had not received the power and authority to baptize from heaven, then He would not have it at all. He them reminded them that he had already told them (probably on numerous occasions and not just in John 1:20) that he was not the Christ but was only a forerunner of Him. John was not upset because Christ had come and was replacing John’s ministry with His own, but he was rather glad for it. He expressed it with an illustration of how the best man in a wedding is glad when the bridegroom comes for the bride—he is not upset that the focus and attention is not on him, but is rejoicing for the great blessing that has befallen the couple. John’s joy was fulfilled now that Christ had come; He was the One for whom John had spent his whole life looking and proclaiming and now he had come.</p>
<p>John realized that he himself was a teacher who spoke about God, and that Christ was a teacher who was God. John knew his ministry of teaching had to decrease as the ministry of Christ came to fullness. Jesus deserved this place of epitome in ministry for He was the highest One—the One that came down from heaven. Jesus was the greatest teacher for He spoke the Words of God in first person. He was not teaching history of what had happened nor did He pronounce philosophy of what might happen, but He proclaimed the pure unadulterated Word of God—that which was at that very moment happening. He had “all things” given into His hands to give unto men, and if any man would hear and believe His teaching, they would receive eternal life.</p>
