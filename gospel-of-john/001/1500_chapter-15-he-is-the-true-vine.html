<h1>Chapter 15: He is the True Vine</h1>
<p>Jesus begins this chapter with an allegory depicting Himself as the true vine and humanity as the branches. This chapter reaffirms to us the life giving nature of Christ; if a man is dwelling in Christ, then he will be full of life and that life will show and outward manifestation of that life that will bring other men to Christ. Not all men will truly abide in Christ even though they proclaim that they do; these men are unprofitable and will have no place with Christ on the Judgment Day.</p>
<h2>The Vine (Christ) 15:1-6</h2>
<p>Jesus declares in the opening of this allegory by stating that He is the true vine and that the Father is the Husbandman. The Father is the One that created the plan of salvation-¬the One that planted the Vine here in this earth so there would be an option for men to be attached to Him. The work of God made provision for all men to be united with the Godhead in one heart and one mind. Christ did not create this work Himself, but He acted in complete obedience to the will of the Husbandman (John 5:36; 17:4).</p>
<p>Jesus then explains to His disciples two types of branches that correspond to two types of people: the unproductive branches, which are sinners, and the productive branches, which are saints. The unproductive branches are altogether cut off from the vine, while the productive branches are pruned so that they will bring forth more fruit. God will purify your life of things that are hindering you from producing results. Sin in our lives will hinder our ability to witness to the lost, so we must allow God to convict us and then respond to that conviction by repenting. If we continue to be pliable in the hands of the Creator, we will continue to grow stronger and our light will grow brighter.</p>
<p>These productive branches did not produce the fruit out of any ability of their own, but they produced fruit because they were connected to the vine. A branch that is disconnected from a natural plant will never bring forth any results, the same is true in the spiritual, for we can never, ever, expect to be truly productive in this life unless we are united with Christ. We must constantly keep our hearts and motives in check so that we never grow confident in our abilities and to ensure that we are depending on God in every thing that we do.</p>
<p>If we do remain in Him, then we can expect to bring forth fruit. Men will see our good works and glorify God (Matthew 5:16). If our lives are truly exalting Jesus, then men will be drawn unto salvation in Christ (John 12:32). Souls getting saved by our witness is better than any physical reward that we could gain. Money and other physical goods will soon rot and rust, but the souls of the men that we lead to Christ will live forever and will be an eternal memorial to our faithfulness.</p>
<p>Those unproductive branches that have been cut off of the vine are soon withered are eventually cast into the fire to be destroyed. Men cannot live apart from Christ for too long until it will be quite noticeable that they have no real life. They will wither up, that is, the joy and peace will depart from their life and they will be known to be miserable. Many people may try to put on a facade of happiness, but deep down inside they know that there are unhappy. The eventual end of these sous are that they are to be cast forever into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:15).</p>
<h2>The Productive Branches (The Saints) 15:7-17</h2>
<p>Now that Jesus briefly covered the ideas of the True Vine and the productive and unproductive branches, He then goes on by explaining the people represented by both types of branches, beginning with the fruitful boughs.</p>
<p>As already mentioned earlier, the productive branches are only so because they are connected to Christ. We must fully depend upon Him if there is to be any value in our lives. We are hopeless without Him for in Him we live and move and have our being (Acts 17:28). Even as a child must depend upon its mother for everything it needs, even so must we depend upon God; to neglect to do this will certainly result in absolute disaster. Deuteronomy 30:20 and John 14:6 explain that God will not only help us in life, but that He is our life.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>We must abide in His Words 15:7, 8</h3>
<p>A part of abiding in Christ is for His words to abide in us. Many people proclaim to follow Jesus, and yet they hardly know any of His words, let alone obey them. Jesus was saying that if we are to be united with Him, the His Word had to be an integrated part of our lives. We are commanded to study the Word (II Tim. 2:15), mediate upon it (Josh. 1:8), and remember it (Proverbs 2:1, 5; Psalm 119:11). We are to do this so that it will be more than dead letters but life unto us (John 6:63, 68). It is not enough for us to just have an understanding of these words or even to speak them, but we must obey them.</p>
<h3>We must abide in His love 15:9-17</h3>
<p>Although it is essential to bearing spiritual fruit, obedience to the laws of God is not enough in itself; obedience must be coupled with love. True obedience and true love are a garment with no seem--the two cannot be absolutely distinguished from each other. If you love God, then you will keep His commandments (John 14:15). Romans 13:8-10 explains that love is the fulfilling of the law because if you have love towards someone, then you will not want to hurt them in any way; Jesus said practically the same thing when He said that on love “hang[s] all the law and the prophets” (Matthew 22:37-40).</p>
<p>Without the love of God, all of our good works are in vain (I Cor. 13:1-3). You may obey all the commands of God to the letter, yet if your heart and motives are not right then you will never bring forth any fruit.</p>
<h2>The Unproductive Branches (The Sinners) 15:18-27</h2>
<p>We are not saved by good works (Eph. 2:8, 9), but once we are saved, we must maintain our salvation by good works. A man that cares not to pull others out of the same pit that he was once in, will soon find himself back in the pit. Those that have become a part of the vine of Christ will soon find themselves severed unless they bring forth fruit.</p>
<p>There are many men that proclaim to be a part of the body of Christ, yet they have long been disunited from Him because of their sin and selfishness that they let slip in. Others have never truly been engrafted into Christ and yet they speak as if they have. Both of these types of men will act as if they know God and will go to church and even preach, but though they may have deceived men and even themselves to believe that this is true, God is not deceived. In the Judgment Day He will separate the wheat from the chaff and will cast the false into eternal judgment. Other unconnected branches have never pledged to be a part of Christ and they will meet the same ending as the hypocrite.</p>
<h3>They will hate us as they hated Jesus 15:18-20</h3>
<p>Jesus warned that these unprofitable branches will hate us--His reason for saying so? Because if they hated Him, then they will surely hate anyone that is truly following Him. In Luke 6:26 Jesus proclaimed that it would not be a good thing if all men spoke well of you for that means that there is nothing in you that is convicting them of their sin and compelling them to turn to God.</p>
<h3>They hate Jesus even as they hated the Father 15:21-27</h3>
<p>They did not think that they hated the Father, but though their mouths drew nigh to God, their hearts were far from Him (Isaiah 29:13). If they had truly known the Father, then they would have accepted Jesus when He came.</p>
