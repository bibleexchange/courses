<h1>Chapter 6: He is the Bread of Life</h1>
<p>After healing the crippled man by the pool of Bethesda, Jesus took a ship over the Sea of Galilee (Matt. 13:14), which is also called lake of Gennesaret (Luke 5:1) and here in John, the sea of Tiberias (Tiberias was a port city on the Sea of Galilee that Herod had renovated and enlarged and then renamed it such in honor of the Roman Emperor, who bore the same name). In Galilee they had been so busy that they did not even have time to eat, and so Jesus said to them, “Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while” (Mark 6:31). Now, across the sea, He took His disciples to a desert place in the outskirts of the city of Bethsaida (Luke 9:10) to have an exclusive time of rest and fellowship with the twelve. It was here that Jesus showed that He was the Bread of Life.</p>
<h2>The Bread of Life Revealed 6:1-21</h2>
<p>Jesus wanted to do more than just tell the disciples and the multitudes that He was the Bread of Life, but He wanted to show them who He was. He performed two signs (the feeding of the 5,000 and walking on the water) to prove that He was the Master of Quantity and the Master over Natural Law; at the same time He also proved that He was the Bread of Life that could meet and satisfy our every need.</p>
<h3>Revealed by feeding the multitude 6:1-13</h3>
<p>Jesus’ desire was to have a time alone with His disciples, but it did not happen for out</p>
<p>of the cities came a multitude of people that followed after Him to this meeting place in the wilderness. These people had heard of the miracles that Jesus had done. Some of them probably came because they wanted needs of their own to be fulfilled, while others, little doubt, just desired to spectate any miracles that Jesus would perform. The number of this</p>
<p>multitude was possibly somewhere around 10,000 to 15,000 , for there were 5,000 men plus an unnumbered amount of woman and children.</p>
<p>When Jesus saw these people coming to Him, He had compassion on them, “and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing” (Luke 9:11). This time of ministering brought them to dusk, and the disciples asked Jesus to</p>
<p>have Him dismiss the crowd so that they could go into the town and buy food to eat. Jesus responded, “They need not depart; give ye them to eat” (Matthew 14:16); He knew that they did not need to go out to the world to get their needs met, but He knew that He could meet all their needs. He asked Philip, “Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?” (John 6:5).</p>

<h1>#5 Master of Quantity</h1>
	<p>
	Our human expectations are often limited to the resources we see. If we see threatening storm clouds, then we expect a storm, but God can take a small cloud and produce from it an abundance of rain (I Kings 18:41-45). Jesus took the little that was given out of faith and increased it so that all could eat.
	</p>
</div>
<p>Jesus already knew how He Himself would provide the food for these people, but He wanted to reveal what Philip would say, which was, “Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.”</p>
<p>Peter then entered the conversation by telling Jesus about a boy that was in the crowd that had five barely loaves and two small fish. The boy had probably overheard Jesus’ conversation and wanted to do what he could to help. Peter did not have the faith of the boy and added, “what are they among so many?” Jesus had the disciples tell the people to sit down on the grass to prepare to eat. Jesus then took the food that the boy had sacrificed, and when He had blessed it, He broke the bread and gave it to His disciples to distribute to the people. A miracle occurred, for the disciples were able to keep giving the multitude food until all were fed; there was even enough left over to fill twelve baskets full!</p>
<p>This was the first event that was recorded by all four gospel writers (Matt. 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-13). It was a miracle that proved that we do not need to be searching in the world to find the things that we need, but if we partake of the Bread of Life and rely upon Him, then in all things we can be content and satisfied.</p>
<h3>Revealed by walking on water 6:14-21</h3>
<p>After this phenomenon of feeding the multitude, there were some that realized that Jesus was the Prophet that was spoken of in Deuteronomy 18:15 that would be the Messiah. Their revelation was weak, and they did not comprehend that Jesus came to set up a spiritual kingdom and not an earthly one. They possibly felt that if He had power to multiply bread, then He certainly had power to conquer nations. These men conspired to take Jesus by force and make Him a king over them that could lead in a revolt against the Roman Empire. Jesus knew their hearts and He would have no part of it. He took a time of solitude from all men, including His disciples, and departed to a mountain to pray (Matt. 14:23). This departing of Jesus reveals to us His humility and self denial. There is little doubt that during this time of prayer that Jesus was petitioning the Father for strength to conquer the temptations of pride and self-glorification that He knew could destroy Him as well as the plan of salvation.</p>

	<h1>#6 Master of Natural Law</h1>

	<p>It is impossible for a man to walk on the water, but Jesus, who formulated the laws of nature during the process of creation, was able to override the law of gravity and walk on the top of the water at the amazement of His disciples.</p>
</div>

<p>While Jesus was on the mountain praying, the disciples took a ship west across the sea to head to Capernaum at the request of Jesus (Matt. 14:22). While they were crossing he sea, a terrible storm came upon them and tossed the small ship in the waves. They toiled hard rowing, trying to get the ship to shore, but they were without success. Then suddenly they saw a figure walking in their direction on top of the water. They thought it was a ghost and cried out from fear. The figure then revealed Himself to be Jesus as He said, “It is I; be not afraid.” Matthew records how that after the salutation of Jesus that Peter also walked on the water after Jesus bade him to come to Him but then ended up sinking when he saw the raging waves (Matt. 14:28-31). When Jesus and Peter got onto the ship, another miracle occurred and they were instantly safe on the shore of Capernaum. The Bread of Life manifested Himself once again, revealing to His disciples that He could not only feed and provide, but that He could also protect and empower. </p>


<h2>The Bread of Life Expressed 6:22-58</h2>
<h3>It is living bread 6:22-29</h3>
<p>The next morning when the people of Bethsaida could not find their new “king,” they boarded ships and followed after Jesus to Capernaum. When they found Jesus, they inquired of when He had gone over, for they did not see Him enter a ship. In His usual manner, Jesus looked past their question and answered their actual need by revealing that they were not interested in the One that performed the miracles, but they just wanted more food to fill their stomachs. He then advised them to “Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you.” You could eat all the bread in the world, and yet it would never produce eternal life in your soul. Jesus wanted them to look past the natural and realize that there was life in the Spirit that they had not yet experienced. This life can only come from partaking of the Bread of Life.</p>
<p>“For Him hath God the Father sealed.” According James M. Freeman in His book, The New Manners and Customs of the Bible, there is record of these “seals” among ancient Egyptians when they would carefully search over an animal that was intended to be sacrificed. If the animal was free from all blemishes, then “the priest bound a label to his horns, applied wax to the label, and sealed it with his ring. This set it apart for sacrifice, and no animal could be offered unless it bore this seal.” This scripture is then speaking of how God the Father had set His seal upon the Son as His approval for Him to be the sacrifice of the sins of all humanity.</p>
<p>The people asked Jesus what they would have to do so that they could perform such works of God as Jesus performed. Jesus told them that the work of God was to believe on Him. If we are ever to do anything for the Kingdom of Heaven, it will be by faith. As we believe in God and hear and obey His voice, then He will lead us to do great and mighty acts in His name. None of these miracles are possible unless we believe first (Mark 16:17).</p>
<h3>It is heavenly bread 6:30-33</h3>
<p>Even after Jesus told them to labour for the everlasting bread, the people still wanted to justify their carnal hunger. They asked Jesus to give them a sign, and as an example, they reminded Him of how the Israelites received manna from heaven while they wandered through the wilderness (it seems that their bellies were hungry and they were hoping that Jesus would do the same thing). They were dis-acknowledging that Jesus had already given them a sign the day before, as well as the many other miracles that they had either witnessed personally or at least heard about that drew them to Jesus in the first place.</p>
<p>Jesus explained to them that it was not Moses that gave them the manna, but it was God the Father. In like manner, God also gave the Son from the realms of Heaven. Jesus did not originate on earth from any desire of man, but He came from the celestial realms at the command of God. Likewise, all His power was not granted to Him by man, but by God Himself.</p>
<h3>It is satisfying bread 6:34-40</h3>
<p>The crowd responded to Jesus with a request for a constant flow of the bread that came down from heaven; it is quite possible that they were still hoping for something to feed their physical bodies even after all Jesus had said to tell them that they needed more than that. Jesus stopped all confusion of to what He was referring as He declared, “I am the Bread of Life” (John 6:35). He had the ability to satisfy the soul of every man. The will of the Father was for Him to bestow eternal life on all that believed on Him and to help them through their pilgrimage on earth so that they could make it to heaven “at that last day.” There is no greater source than Jesus for help in our every need, in fact, there is no other source at all.</p>
<h3>It is promised bread 6:41-51</h3>
<p>The crowd was angered when Jesus titled Himself as the Bread of Life because they believed Joseph and Mary to be the parents of Jesus and so He had no claims to have come from heaven. What they did not know was that although Mary may have been Jesus’ mother, Joseph was not Jesus’ father--God alone had right to that title.</p>
<p>Jesus silenced their murmuring, and explained to them that the manna in the wilderness was not enough for their fathers, for they ate it and yet they still died. The manna was not meant to be the end result, but it was only a type pointing forward to the promise of Christ.</p>
<h3>It is essential bread 6:52-58</h3>
<p>Eating of the Bread of Life is not an option, but it is a requirement if you want to have the life of Gd in you. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Him (John 14:6).</p>
<p>Jesus said we must eat His flesh and drink His blood to have eternal life; Jesus is not saying that we must eat His physical meat nor must we actually drink His blood, but we must believe in His laid down life (eat His flesh; the bread) and His shed blood (drink His blood; the wine). It is essential for us to believe these things, or else we could never have eternal life.</p>
<h2>The Bread of Life Dismissed 6:59-71</h2>
<h3>Rejected by the multitude 6:59-66</h3>
<p>This discourse of Jesus on the Bread of Life caused no small stir among the crowd that day. Many of them thought that the things that Jesus were deep and impossible for men to hear and obey. We must note that these people were not novices that had never heard Jesus speak before, but they were considered “His disciples” (though it is not then referring to the twelve). Jesus explained to them that if they were thin enough to be offended by Him saying that He was of heavenly origin, then they certainly would be offended if they saw Him ascend to heaven.</p>
<p>Because of the things that Jesus said that day, many of those disciples (which was probably a large portion of the 5,000 men that He had fed the previous day) ceased from following Jesus. We must remember that the crowd is not always right, and in fact, the crowd is almost always wrong. If we are to follow God, then we must do it because we believe His words and not because it is the popular thing to do.</p>
<h3>Received by the eleven 6:67-69</h3>
<p>Jesus was not entirely rejected that day, but eleven of the twelve disciples adhered at least partially to His doctrine then. After the crowd forsook Jesus, He turn t the twelve and asked them if they too would desert Him. Peter, being the spokesperson, answered boldly, “Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.” Their understanding may not have then been complete, but they did believe that Jesus was the Son of God, and that faith compelled them to follow this Messiah even if the world forsook Him.</p>
<h3>Rejected by Judas 6:70-71</h3>
<p>Not all the twelve disciples believed in Jesus with all of their hearts; Judas Iscariot had doubt in his heart that lead him to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Judas followed Jesus in outward actions that were seen by the eyes of men, but his heart was far from God. Jesus knew Judas’ heart, and although it was some time before He was betrayed, Jesus proclaimed that one of them would betray Him.</p>
