<h1>Chapter 8: He is the Defender of the Weak</h1>
<h2>Jesus Pardons the Adulterous Woman 8:1-11</h2>
<h3>The Accusation 8:1-5a</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter we see Jesus going up into the Mount of Olives after His day of answering question and refuting false accusations of the people described in the previous chapter. It is quite probable that He went there to pray to receive strength and wisdom to face the battles ahead of Him.</p>
<p>In the morning He went back to the temple and taught the people that were there. While He was teaching, the Pharisees brought to Him a woman that had been caught in the act of adultery. They reminded Him that the judgment for this crime according to Moses was that she should be stoned (Lev. 20:10).</p>
<h3>The Question 8:5b</h3>
<p>The Pharisees then proposed a question to Jesus, “What sayest thou?” They were looking to trap Jesus, because if he said to stone her, then they would call Him heartless and a murderer. If He said to let her go free, then they would say that He had no regard to the law of Moses. While they may have thought they had Jesus in a “catch-22,” they did not realize that Jesus knew their hearts and minds and was well aware of their trap.</p>
<h3>The Response 8:6-9</h3>
<h4>Some silent writing 8:6</h4>
<p>Instead of giving the Pharisees an answer, He bent down and started writing on the ground with His finger. There is no indication in Scripture of what He wrote, but some believe He was writing the Ten Commandments and others believe that He was writing the sins of those present.</p>

<blockquote><p>I feel he wrote in the sand the law and their name by it. What he wrote in the sand convicted their conscious and that is grace at work, Jesus did not come to destroy his accusers but to save them, in the midst of their accusations, he is still giving them opportunity to repent. He wrote in the sand what they needed to see. -- James Reynolds, Sr.
</p></blockquote>

<p>(While these are possible theories, they are conjecture.)</p>
<h4>A call for an immaculate executioner 8:7-9</h4>
<p>The Pharisees continued to ask Jesus and press Him for an answer. Jesus finally did give them an answer. He rose to His feet and told them that He that was sinless should be the one to throw the first stone. After saying this, He bent down and continued to write.</p>
<p>This answer surprised the Pharisees; they knew all knew that they had sinned and were convicted by their consciences. They may have been convicted, but they were not repentant. They could have chosen to make their hearts right with God, but instead they continued in their sin and were still driven by a desire to destroy Jesus. One by one they started to leave knowing that their plan to trick Jesus had failed this time.</p>
<h3>The Judgment 8:10-11</h3>
<p>When Jesus knew that all the men were gone, He looked up at the woman and asked her where her accusers were. She told Him that there was no one accusing her now. He told her that He did not condemn her either. Jesus was sinless and thus had the right to throw the stone at her, but He instead chose to forgive her.</p>
<p>Jesus told the woman to go and sin no more, which is similar to the command that he gave the man in chapter five (5:14). The grace of God does not give us a license to sin, but it is the power to deliver and keep us from sin (Rom. 6:15).</p>
<h2>Jesus Establishes His Testimony 8:12-30</h2>
<h3>The witnesses of Jesus-The Son and Father 8:12-20</h3>
<p>Jesus later told the people that He was the Light of the world, but the Jews would not believe His testimony for they felt He was self-proclaimed. Jesus affirmed to them that His testimony was true, for although they might have not realized it, Jesus knew that He came from the realms of heaven.</p>
<p>Jesus had another witness to verify His words, and that was the Father. The Jews asked Him who His Father was, and Jesus told them that they did not truly know Him nor His Father, for if they really knew one, then they would know the other. Jesus was not saying that He was the Father, but that He and His Father were so united and inseparable in will and mind that if you were to fellowship with one then you would also know the other.</p>
<h3>The origin of Jesus-Heaven 8:21-24</h3>
<p>Jesus told the Jews that He would one day return to heaven from where He came and that they would not be able to come after Him. The reason that they would not be able to go to heaven was that their hearts were filled with unbelief and sin. They were not willing to repent, so they would ultimately die in that sin.</p>
<h3>The nature of Jesus-Submissive 8:25-30</h3>
<h4>Submissive to the words of the Father 8:26-27</h4>
<h4>Submissive to death 8:28</h4>
<h4>Submissive to the will of the Father 8:29</h4>
<h2>Jesus Classifies His Disciples 8:31-51</h2>
<h3>The Qualifications of Disciples 8:31-32</h3>
<h4>Disciples must continue in the words of Jesus 8:31</h4>
<h4>Disciples must know the truth 8:32</h4>
<h3>The Privileges of Disciples 8:33-36</h3>
<h4>Abiding forever 8:35</h4>
<h4>Freedom 8:36</h4>
<h3>The Disqualifications of Disciples 8:37-51</h3>
<h4>Not having the words of Jesus in their heart 8:37</h4>
<h4>Not following the example of Abraham 8:39-40</h4>
<h4>Not loving Jesus 8:42</h4>
<h4>Obeying the lusts of the devil 8:44</h4>
<h4>Not believing the words of Jesus 8:45-46</h4>
<h4>Not hearing the words of the Father 8:47</h4>
<h4>Dishonoring Christ 8:49</h4>
<p>Jesus revealed to the Pharisees that in not being His disciples and not obeying His words or following His actions that they were also not children of the Father, for He and His Father are one. If you deny Jesus, the you also deny the Father (I John 2:23).</p>
<h2>Jesus Reaffirms His Authority 8:52-59</h2>
<p>The Jews were upset because Jesus had promised in verse fifty-one that all those that would keep His sayings could have eternal life. In the minds of these Jews, Abraham was the greatest man that had ever lived and if he, along with all the other prophets and men of God, died, then everyone else was sure to die. They did not like Jesus proclaiming Himself to be greater then their patriarchs.</p>
<p>Jesus clarified that it was not His own self proclamation that made Him great, but that it was the blessing of the Father that made Him great. He further explained that He was not only greater than Abraham, but that He was also existent before Abraham. The Jews were angered at this truth and they sought to execute Jesus by stoning Him to death, but since it was not yet Jesus’ time to die, He was able to escape their fury unharmed.</p>
