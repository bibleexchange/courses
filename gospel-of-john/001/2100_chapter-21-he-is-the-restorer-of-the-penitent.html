<h1>Chapter 21: He is the Restorer of the Penitent</h1>
<p>The resurrected Christ directs our service for Him. This can result only when the risen Lord reveals Himself to His own. The proofs of the resurrection had already been given. Notice how chapter twenty-one is introduced, “After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the Disciples.” The term, “Showed Himself” can be understood to mean “manifested Himself.” In the Greek, manifested means to shine forth. When Jesus appeared to the disciples the third time, He showed forth His power and glory one more time to them.</p>
<h2>Jesus Appears a Third Time to the Disciples 21:1-14</h2>
<p>Those that were present at this third appearance of Christ to His disciples were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathaniel of Cana in Galilee, and two of the other disciples who are not named.</p>
<p>Peter remarked that he was going fishing, and the other disciples agreed with him and came along. This was more than a fishing trip, but it was a return to the old life of self-service before they yielded to Christ’s call to leave their nets. They were called to be fishers of men and yet they returned to the meager trade of catching fish. Peter had a negative influence on the disciples; instead of leading them in the faith of Christ, he was leading them in the doubts of the carnal mind.</p>
<p>“That night they caught nothing.” Peter’s influence was not spiritually motivated&mdash;when they tried fishing in their own strength they accomplished nothing, yet when they were directed by Jesus they had great results. There will certainly be times when we must partake in natural duties to maintain a living, but if we are to do so we must be directed to do so by God.</p>

<p>Do not get it mixed up, but always do it God&apos;s way. When God gives a specific word like this (&quot;cast the nets&quot;), do exactly that. They remembered how they had already been casting the nets, but when God says &quot;cast the nets&quot; something diferent has to happen.</p>

<p>The disciples return to land and they saw a fire with coals and fish on the fire. This was a revelation of the all-sufficiency of the Risen Lord and it shows Peter and the disciples their inadequacy and self-shame as they tried to go their way without Him.</p>
<h2>Jesus Gives Some Instruction to Peter 21:15-24</h2>

<div class="highlights left">
	<h1>#9 Master of Love</h1>
	<p>The miracle of the draught of fish was far more important than filling some fishermen&apos;s nets. All these men had forsook Jesus when the going got tough, yet we find Christ once again being sufficient for whatever they needed. Jesus intervenes in the normal course of events for the good of men who neglected Him. What boundless love!</p>

<h3>Peter told to feed the flock of God 21:15-17</h3>
<p>The qualification for feeding lambs, and shepherding sheep is that of the love of God. Feed My sheep – this is a pastoral work and demands love for the “good shepherd” of the sheep as the primary qualifications. In John 10 Jesus calls Himself the Good Shepherd and now He wants Peter to shepherd His sheep as well.</p>
<h3>Peter told to follow Jesus no matter what others did 21:18-24</h3>
<p>Peter did not like Jesus singling him out and putting him on the spot, so he looked over to John and asked Jesus “What about him?” Jesus told him, “If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?” He was not saying that John would live until He returned, but that Peter should not worry about what John was doing. Sometimes it is easy for us to get caught up watching what other people are doing and we forget to follow Jesus. If your eyes are stayed on Him, then we can safely finish the journey even if no other man around us does. People misunderstood what Jesus said, and the rumor spread abroad that Jesus said John would not die.</p>
<h2>Conclusion to Gospel of John 21:25</h2>
<p>In these last two verses John reveals that he is the writer of this gospel account of Jesus Christ. He also notes that he knows that it is not an exhaustive account of Jesus’ life and ministry. He supposes that it would be an impossible task to compile such a work, for if everything that Jesus did was written down, then the world could not contain all the books it would take.</p>
<p>A Christian should never stop his quest in seeking to know Jesus. That is why Paul, even though he was a great preacher and wrote much of the New Testament, said in Philippians 3:10, “That I may know Him.” He was not content with his knowledge of the Christ, but he knew that there were depths that he had not yet discovered. He longed to be closer to Him and have a greater relationship with Him. We may have finished this specific study on the Gospel of John, but let it not be the end of your studies of Jesus. There could never be too much knowledge gathered about that Man.</p>
