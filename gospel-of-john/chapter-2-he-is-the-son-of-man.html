<h1>Chapter 2: He is the Son of Man</h1>
<p>In chapter one we see the Divinity of Jesus as witnessed by both Johns, but we must remember that while He was very much God that He was also very much man. He is not only the Son of God, but He is also the Son of Man. The second chapter of John magnifies this fact as we see Jesus mingle at a wedding, interact with His mother, participate in the Passover, and show the human emotion of anger.</p>

<h2>The Wedding at Cana 2:1-11</h2>
<h3>The Request 2:1-3</h3>
<p>Either three days after Jesus talked to Nathanael or three days after Jesus had entered Galilee He and His disciples were invited to a wedding feast in Cana. Cana (modern Kefr Kenna) was a small town about six miles northeast of Nazareth in the tribe of Asher (Josh. 19:28). The description “of Galilee” was used to distinguish it from another Cana, which was in the tribe of Ephraim, in the Samaritan country (Josh. 16:8; 17:9).</p>
<p>Along with Jesus and His disciples, there was present Mary, the mother of Jesus. It is quite probable that one of the married couple was closely related to Jesus and His mother and that is why they were both present at the feast.</p>
<p>A problem arose at this feast—they ran out of wine, either because of a lack of planning or because more guests had arrived than had been expected. Now the bridegroom was in danger of displeasing his newly acquired father-in-law (the ruler of the feast) by this lack of planning on his part and the mother of Jesus sought to help the situation.</p>
<p>“They have no wine,” she said to her Son. Before this time she had never seen Him perform a miracle and so it was evident that she firmly believed that He was not a normal man and that He had supernatural power even though He had not revealed it yet.</p>
<h3>The Response 2:4-8</h3>
<p>“Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.” Jesus was not being impudent or disrespectful; He was simply showing her and those around Him that although He was the Son of God, it was not His time to be glorified. He did not come to earth for this purpose of meeting man’s physical need, but His “hour” would come when He would meet man’s spiritual need on the cross (John 17:1). Even though it was not His purpose to physically help man and neither did He owe it to the bridegroom or any of the others present to assist in the situation, we see His humanity as He shows compassion for this bridegroom and respect to the request of His mother and He proceeds to perform a miracle.
Mary shows confidence in her Son by encouraging the servants to do whatsoever He may command. That day they did not have wine, but they did have good attitudes, obedience, and willing hearts and when those ingredients are mixed with the power of God great things will happen. Obedience to Christ is always the believer’s duty, even though he does not totally comprehend the reasons for Christ’s commands (Gen. 41:55).</p>

	<h1>#1 Master of Quality</h1>
	<p>
	At the wedding of Cana Jesus turned water into wine proving that He had the ability to take that which was unwanted (water) and make it something that was wanted (wine). At seeing the sign the disciples believed that He could make something good out of anything that was destroyed by sin.

<p>Jesus told them to fill the six stone pots with water. These pots were used for the purification of the Jews, which is referring to their complex custom of washing their hands before eating (Mark 7:1-5), which is known as Netilat yadayim. Using the left hand water would be taken out of the pot with a smaller vessel and poured over the right hand first (because the right hand has precedence in the Jewish religion) then they would take the vessel in the right hand and clean the left hand. It is noteworthy that modern Jews wash their hands before performing Netilat yadayim because the purpose is not to wash the hands, but rather to purify them. These pots that had been at least partially if not entirely empty from religious rituals were now they were being refilled to fulfill obedience of the divine will.</p>

<h3>The Results 2:9-11</h3>
<h4>The water was made wine</h4>
<p>After the pots were filled, Jesus then told the servants to “Draw out now, and bare unto the governor of the feast.” There is no indication in the Scripture that anything special had happened to the water as of yet, so as these servants moved in obedience to take the water to the new father-in-law they were also taking a big step of faith. Telling men to act before results are seen is not a strange thing for God, for we see Him tell Joshua to have the priests step into the Jordan River before it dried up (Josh. 3:8, 13) and Jesus told the ten lepers to go tell the priest that they had been cleansed while they still possessed the plague (Luke 17:14). In both situations it was not until the action of obedience had take place that the miracles occurred; the same is true here in John two, for it is not certain exactly when the miracle took place, but it is certain that when the ruler drank what the servants brought him that he tasted fresh grapes and not plain water. There has been added to the water that which was not there before; the same power that said, “Let there be light” called these elements and additional compounds together in a twinkling of an eye and performed the miracle of once water, but now is good wine.</p>
<h4>The ruler was pleased</h4>
<p>The governor of the feast knew all the resources of the feast, but this puzzled him. He knew that he had never tasted wine of this quality before.</p>
<p>“But thou has kept the good wine until now.” There was no reply from the
bridegroom recorded after this statement was made. The silence was a good indication of his agreeing to the fact that it was good wine.</p>
<h4>The disciples believed</h4>
<p>This miraculous event of turning water into wine was the “beginning of miracles” for Jesus. Jesus did not come to the wedding to be romantic, put on a show, do magic, deceive, entertain, or excite the people present, but the object of Jesus being there was to convey to His disciples a little something of His vast power which He has for meeting any emergency that arises in their experiences ahead. Because of the miracle His disciples believed on Him; they had already believed He was the One that they should follow, but now they believed that He had unlimited resources at His disposal—they realized a little more that He was the Son of God.</p>
<p>There is no record that anyone else besides the disciples believed on Jesus because of the miracle. We know for certain that the ruler of the feast didn’t know where the wine had come from and it is very possible that the bridegroom didn’t know either, so neither one of them would have believed on Jesus because of the miracle. That is the problem with the world, so few recognize that it is God that has worked in their lives for the good.</p>
<h2>The Cleansing of the Temple 2:12-17</h2>
<p>Moving on from Cana of Galilee we see Jesus make His first recorded appearance in Jerusalem since He confounded the doctors as a boy (Luke 2:41-51). The occasion for His presence was the Passover, which was celebrated for seven days once every year from the 15th to the 21st of the month Abib (which corresponds to our April) and represents the first Exodus of the Israelites as they were delivered from Egypt. As the Son of Man, Jesus’ participation in this event was not a strange thing for according to the Law every male among the Jews was required to appear at this feast (Deut. 16:6).</p>
<p>Upon entering the temple, Jesus sees men trying to make money by exploiting people’s half-hearted desire for religion. Some men were selling sheep and cattle that were required by every man to offer as a sacrifice, while other men were taking foreign money from pilgrims that had traveled from all over the world and exchanged it for a half-shekel of silver (the shekel of the sanctuary) that was offered to the priest (Ex. 30:13); no doubt these merchants charged a fee for the exchange. Josephus recorded that 256,500 animals were offered yearly and there was probably close to the same amount of shekels given—that would have been a large profit for these men.</p>

<div class="highlights left">
	<h1>#2 Master of Souls</h1>
	<p>
	Jesus showed authority when He commanded the merchants to leave the temple. It shows that He had the power to make judgment on men’s souls and command what they should do. As the disciples remembered the words of Psalm 69:9, they realized that this power came from Heaven and not any earthly throne.
	</p>
</div>

<p>These practices of accommodating travelers from afar off were not altogether wrong, but what was wrong was that they were using God’s Holy House as a common marketplace. At the same time, the people’s lack of coming prepared to the celebration shows how that the religious scene at this time was only one of formality where no real thought of sacrifice or dedication was involved.</p>
<p>When Jesus saw these men He did not hesitate to execute the judgment they deserved. He made a scourge of small cords and quickly disrupted their wares and expelled them from the temple as He declared, “Take these things hence! Make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise!” There is little doubt that Jesus here expressed the human emotion of anger, which is not a sin in itself as long as it is not coupled with other sins (Eph. 4:26). Jesus did not sin in what He did, but rather He was in essence refuting sin as He moved to cleanse the temple that day.
God had always judged sin, but until this point we had seen it executed from the realms of heaven as in such circumstances as the fire on Sodom and Gomorrah and the plagues on Egypt. Now we see judgment executed differently only as the Son of Man could do it—God was directly punishing man through the hands of flesh.</p>
<h2>The Sign of the Resurrection 2:18-25</h2>
<p>At the sight of Jesus dispelling these merchants from the temple the Jews were amazed at the authority that Jesus displayed and they wanted to know why He had the right to do such a thing—they wanted Him to give them a sign to prove that He was from God. Jesus gave them a sign, but He gave it in a parable, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” Jesus was referring to His body as the temple and was referring to the crucifixion and resurrection. The Jews did not understand this and thought he was speaking of the physical temple, which they denied could be rebuilt in three days since it had taken forty-six years to erect originally. Their unbelief in His sign did not make it any less real, for after He had arose the disciples remembered it and realized what He had been talking about.</p>

<p>This sign was different then the divine signs that the Hebrews had received in the past for it was not given by a prophet, angel, or other oracle of God, but now that the Son of Man had come, God spoke in the first person and He Himself gave the sign. There was no middle man needed, but God spoke with man face to face.</p>
