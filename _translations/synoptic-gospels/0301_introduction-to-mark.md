     shida na raha hapa kwasababu Marko ameachwa
(Acts 12:25, 13:5)but it was resolved because he was later with Paul at Rome (Col. 4:10)  and Paul during his last Roman imprisonment, asks Timothy to come to him and to bring Mark also (II Tim. 4:11)
{Matendo 12:25,13:5} lakini walisuluhishwa kwasababu walionekana baadaye na Paulo huko Rumi {col. 4:10} na wakati wa Paulo kuwekwa gerezani mara ya mwisho huko Rumi, anamwomba Timotheo kuja kwake na kumleta Marko pia {11 Tim4:11}

## The People
   Watu
### Mark is writing to the Romans.
   Marko anawaandika kwa Warumi.
#### Unlike Matthew, Mark was not trying to prove certain statements and prophecies concerning Jesus the Messiah.
    Haijalishi Mathayo, Marko hawakuthibitisha maelezo fulani ya unabii kuhusu Yesu ni Mesia.
#### The Romans were more concerned with deeds than words so Markâ€™s gospel is full of action.
     Warumi walihusika zaidi kwa vitendo kuliko maneno hivyo Injili ya Marko imejaa matendo.
#### The Romans were people of action rather than thought.
     Warumi walikuwa watu wa matendo zaidi kuliko mawazo.
#### Mark presents Christ as the mighty worker rather than a profound thinker.
     Marko anamsema Kristo kama mfanya kazi mwenye uwezo mkuu zaid kuliko kufikiri sana. 
#### He presents Jesus as the man who conquers by doing.
     Yeye humsema Yesu kama mtu ambaye ameshinda kwa kufanya.
#### So we have the vivid and rapid record, with little discourse and much movement and accomplishment.
     Hivyo tuna uthibitisho na nakala zilizoenea, kwa maongezi machache na kuzunguka sana na kukamilisha.
### Characteristics of a Roman
    Sifa za Warumi
The Roman was different than the Jew.
 Warumi walikuwa tofauti kuliko Wayahudi.
- His strong point was his strong common sense.
Jambo iao la msingi ndio kawaida yao
- His religion must be practiced.
  Dini yao lazima uifanyie mazoezi
- He would have no interest in tracing beliefs back into the past.
  Hawakupenda kuvutiwa na nyayo za waamini waliopita. 
- Legal geaneologies and fulfillment of prophecies would leave him cold and hard hearted.
  Koo halali na utimilifu wa nabii walimwacha Yeye kwa kasi na kwa ugumu wa mioyo.
- One writer said a Roman might say, &quot;I know nothing of your scriptures, and care nothing for your peculiar notions; but I would be glad to hear a plain story of the life this man Jesus lived. Tell me what He did.  Let me see Him just as He was.&quot;
Mwandishi mmoja alisema Warumi wanaweza kusema, sijui chochote kuhusiana na maandiko, na sijali chochote kwa mawazo yenu maalum; ningefurahi kusikia hadithi dhahiri za maisha ya huyu mtu Yesu aishivyo. Niambieni Yeye hufanya nini. hadi nimuone Yeye alivyo;
