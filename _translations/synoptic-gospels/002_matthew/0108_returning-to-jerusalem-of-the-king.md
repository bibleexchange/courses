The two disciples brought an ass and a colt.

Wanafunzi wawili walileta punda na farasi mdogo.

This parade could not have been compared in magnificence to any procession that has attended the coronation of a king, or the inauguration of a president; but it meant much more for the world.

Maandamano haya hayawezi kulinganishwa na maandamano yoyote ya awali ya sherehe ya kumsimika mfalme, lakini ilikuwa na maana zaidi kwa ulimwengu.

This was the first public recognition of His rights as Messiah and King. He offered Himself as Messiah only to be
rejected and killed. How great is the love of God!

Hii ilikuwa kutambuliwa kwa mara ya kwanza ya haki zake kama Masihi na Mfalme. Alijitoa mwenyewe kama Masihi tu kuwa
kukataliwa na kuuawa. Upendo wa Mungu ni mkubwa sana!

The people spread garments and branches to carpet the highway. They cried out Psalms, and when people asked them who He was they replied, "This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee."

Watu walienea nguo na matawi kwa barabara kuu. Waliliaza Zaburi, na wakati watu waliuliza ni nani wao walijibu, "Huyu ni yule nabii, Yesu, wa Nazareti ya Galilaya."

After the crowd has dispersed, some may have thought that nothing was accomplished in making Him King. His hour had not yet come. Christ must be Savior first and then come as King of kings and Lord of lords.

Baada ya umati wa watu kushoto, wengine wanaweza kuwa walidhani kuwa hakuna kitu kilichotimizwa kumfanya Yeye Mfalme. Saa yake haikuja. Kristo lazima awe Mwokozi kwanza na kisha atakuja kama Mfalme wa wafalme na Bwana wa mabwana.

We see Christ came unto His own, and His own received Him not. There's a difference in being rejected by an enemy and being rejected by a friend. It's even more severe when it is someone you love or family.

Tuliona kwamba alikuja kwake, wala walio wake hawakumpokea. Kuna tofauti katika kukataliwa na adui na kukataliwa na rafiki. Ni vigumu kukataliwa na mtu unayependa au familia yako.

The Kingdom was offered first to the rightful heirs, the children of Israel, the Jews. They refused the offer, rejected the King, and finally crucified Him.

Ufalme ulitolewa kwanza kwa warithi wa haki, wana wa Israeli, Wayahudi. Walikataa zawadi, wakamkataa Mfalme, na hatimaye alisulubisha.

Jesus announced that the Kingdom shall be taken away from the Jews and given to another nation (21:43).

Yesu alitangaza kwamba ufalme utachukuliwa kutoka kwa Wayahudi na kupewa taifa lingine (21:43).

The announcement offended the rulers and they sought to kill Him (21:46).

Tangazo hilo liliwafanya watawala wawe hasira, na walitaka kumwua (21:46).
