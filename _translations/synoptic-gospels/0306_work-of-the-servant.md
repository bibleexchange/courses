###  And He did this - And He said that
     Naye hufanya hivi - Naye husema kwamba
-  Aliwafundisha watu, tulikuwa gizani.        He taught men, they were in darkness
- Aliwatia watu moyo, hatukuwa na tumaini.     He cheered men, they were without hope
- Aliwaponya watu, tulikuwa wagonjwa na kuteswa.    He healed men, they were sick and suffering
- Alituweka huru, tulikuwa chini ya nguvu ya shetani.  He freed men, they were under the power of Satan
- Akiwatakasa watu, tulikuwa wenye dhambi.      He cleansed men, they are sinful 

#### He called His disciples.
     Aliwaita wanafunzi wake.
He selected 4 fishermen to become 4 fishers of men. They were to turn all the practical knowledge and skill over for God's use.
Aliwachagua wavuvi 4 kuwa wavuvi 4 wa watu. Waligeuzwa maarifa ya kazi na ujuzi kwa matumizi ya kazi ya Mungu.
> Marko 1: 18 Mara wakaziacha nyavu zao, wakamfuata.     Mark 1:18 &mdash; And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed
Mark wrote the disciples &quot;straightway&quot; followed Christ. Too often we allow too much time between the call and our coming.
Marko aliandikia wanafunzi palepale; wamfuate Kristo. Mara kwa mara tunakubaliwa mara nyingi sana kati ya kuitwa na ujio wetu.
#### He worked with compassion.
     Alitembea kwa huruma
