# Exaltation of the Servant
  Utukufu wa mtumishi
## Resurrection from the Dead
   ufufuko toka wafu
After the servant had given His life a ransom for all, He arose from the dead.
Baada ya mtumishi kuvaa fidia ya uzima wake kwa wote, akafufuka kutoka wafu.
## Great Commission to His Disciples
   Agizo kuu kwa wanafunzi wake
Read and compare the great commission as found in Mark 16:15-18 and Matt. 28:19-20
Soma na ulinganishe agizo kuu kama tunavyopata katika Marko 16:15-18 na Mathayo 28:19-20
> Mark 16:15-18&mdash;And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. 17  And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 18  They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
Marko 16:15-18; Akawaambia, Enendeni ulimwenguni mwote, mkaihubiri  injili kwa kila kiumbe. 16 Aaminiye na kubatizwa ataokoka; bali asiyeamini atahukumiwa. 17 Na ishara hizi zitafuatana na waaminio; kwa jina langu watatoa pepo; watasema kwa lugha mpya, 18 Watashika nyoka; hata wakinywa kitu cha kufisha, hakitawadhuru kabisa, wataweka mikono yao juu ya wagonjwa, nao watapata afya.
> Matthew 28:19-20&mdash;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20  Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. 
 Mathayo 28:19-20; Basi, Enendeni, mkawafanye mataifa yote kuwa wanafunzi, mkiwabatiza kwa jina la Baba, na Mwana, na rOHO mtakatifu: 20 Na kuwafundisha kuyashika yote niliyowaamuru ninyi; na tazama, mimi nipo pamoja nanyi siku zote, hata ukamilifu wa dahari. Amina.
### We are Laborers with Him
    Sisi tu watenda kazi wake
> I Corinthians 3:9&mdash;For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.
  I Wakorintho 3:9; Maana sisi tu watenda kazi pamoja na Mungu: ninyi ni shamba la Mungu, ni jengo la Mungu. 
### We Must labor always
    Lazima tutende kazi siku zote
> I Corinthians 15:58&mdash;Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. 
   I Wakorintho 15:58; Basi, ndugu zangu wapendwa, mwimarike, msitikisike, mkazidi sana kutenda kazi ya Bwana siku zote, kwa kuwa mwajua ya kwamba taabu yenu sio bure katika Bwana. 
## Ascension to Heaven
   Kupaa kwenda Mbinguni
> Philippians 2:7-9&mdash;But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 8  And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 9  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
  Wafilipi 2:7-9; Bali alijifanya kuwa hana utukufu, akatwaa namna ya mtumwa, akawa anamfano wa wanadamu, 8 tena, alionekana ana umbo kama mwanadamu, alijinyenyekeza akawa mtii hata mauti, naam, mauti ya msalaba. Kwahiyo tena Mungu alimwaadhimisha, akamkirimia Jina lile lipitalo kila jina: 
 Yesu alikuwa wa kwanza katika kuufanya utumishi, ndipo akatukuka juu. Yeye ambaye alichukuliwa juu na kupokea muundo wa utumishi na huko Mbinguni amekaa mkono wa kuume wa Mungu.       Jesus was once in the form of a servant, then highly exalted. He who had taken upon Him the form of a servant was received in Heaven to sit on the right hand of God.
