“After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also”

"Basi, baada ya hayo Bwana aliweka na wengine, sabini"

“Sent them two by two before His face into every city and place, whither He Himself would come.”

"...kawatuma wawili wawili wamtangulie kwenda kila mji na kila mahali alipokusudia kwenda mwenyewe."

We must go where He says to go, where He will be.

Lazima tuende pale ambako anasema tuenda, naye atakuwepo.
