## Mount of Olives (Chapter 22)

## Mlima wa Mizeituni (Sura ya 22)

He told His disciples to pray and withdrew Himself and prayed.

Aliwaambia wanafunzi Wake kuomba na kujiondoa mwenyewe na kuomba.

“Not My will, but will, be done.” Every Christian will face times in his life that he must pray “not my will”

"Si mapenzi yangu, bali yako yatendeke." Kila Mkristo atakabiliwa na wakati katika maisha yake kwamba lazima aombe "sio mapenzi yangu."

“An angel appeared unto Him from heaven strengthening Him.”

"Malaika kutoka mbinguni akamtokea akamtia nguvu."

“Being in agony, He prayed more earnestly”

"Naye kwa vile alivyokuwa katika dhiki, akazidi sana kuomba;"

“His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground”

"Hari yake ikawa kama matone ya damu yakidondoka nchini."

His disciples were sleeping for sorrow.

Wanafunzi wake walikuwa wamelala kwa huzuni.

Soldiers came and Judas betrayed Him with a kiss.

Askari walikuja na Yuda akamsaliti kwa busu.
