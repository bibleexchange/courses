# Wote wanahatia na wako chini ya dhambi-Sura.1:18-32 & 2:1-29

All are Guilty and Under Sin - Ch. 1:18-32 & 2:1-29

> 3:9  Ni nini basi? Tu bora kuliko wengine? La! Hata kidogo. Kwa maana tumekwisha kuwashitaki Wayahudi na Wayunani ya kwamba pia wamekuwa chini ya dhambi;
3:9 &mdash;&hellip; we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;

## Wote wana hatiaAll Are Guilty

Mahitaji ya wanadamu wote ni kuhesabiwa haki kwanjia ya Yesu vinginevyo ghadhabu ya Mungu itafunulliwa dhidi ya hatia.1:18All mankind needs to be justified through Jesus or the wrath of God will be revealed against it. &mdash; 1:18
Yesu ni ndio njia pekee ya wokovu na wale wasio chagua kukubali utoaji wa Kristo wamehukumiwa.jesus is the only way to salvation and those who do not chose to accept the provision of Christ are condemned.

>  Yohn 3:18Amwaminiye yeye hahukumiwi; asiyeamini amekwisha kuhukumiwa; kwa sababu hakuliamini jina la Mwana pekee wa Mungu.
Ghadhabu ya Mungu imefunuliwa kwa wale wasio mcha Mungu na wasio haki.Wale wasio hesabiwa haki kwa njia ya imani watapokea ghadhabu ya Mungu.Wale wanaoshikilia ukweli pasipo haki.Hii inarejea kwa wale ambao wanaujua ukweli,lakini hawashi kwa huo ukweli.Wanamiliki ujuzi wa kuijua kweli lakini bado wanaishi pasipo haki.
John 3:18&mdash;&hellip; he that believeth not is condemned already&hellip;
The wrath of God is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. Those who are not justified by faith will receive the wrath of God. Those who hold the truth in unrighteousness. This refers to those who know the truth, but do not live by it. They possess knowledge of the truth yet live in unrighteousness. The revelation of God&apos;s wrath is upon those that hold the truth in unrighteousness. 

## Hatia ya Wamataifa1:19-32
Gentile Guilt &mdash; 1:19-32

(Wenye dhambi**pasipo** sheria wanasitahili; ghadhabu ya Mungu)Hitimisho la sura hii linaendelezea watu hawa ambao wanahatia nakusitahili ghadhabu ya Mungu.Hawana udhuru.(Sinners **Without** the Law are Deserving of God&apos;s Wrath)
The conclusion of this chapter continues on describing this people who are guilty and worthy of the wrath of God. They are without excuse.

### Walimjua Mungu 1:19-23 They knew God			1:19-23

Mungu alijidhihirisha mwenyewe kwao(mstr 19) Mtu moja aliwahi kusema: uwe mjinga na sio mpumbavu,lakini mwenye akili huiharibu.Kumcha bwana ni chanzo maarifa.(Mith. 1:7; 9:10; 15:33; Zab. 111:110; & Ay 28:28)Uumbaji wenyewe unatangaza matendo ya Mungu(mstr.20)
God has manifested Himself to them (v.19)
Someone has said: &quot;a fool in not an idiot, but one who has intellect and abuses it.&quot;
&quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.&quot; (Prov. 1:7; 9:10; 15:33; Psa. 111:110; & Job 28:28)
Creation itself clearly declares the things of God (v.20)

Maandiko yanatuambia kuwa Mungu amejifunua mwenyewe kwa mwanadamu kwa njia ya uumbaji wake.Kwa hiyo hata kwa wale wasio pokea sheria au kamwe hawajawahi kuisikia injili wamepewa ufunuo wa Mungu kwa njia ya asili kwa hiyo hawana udhuru.The Scripture tells us God has revealed Himself to man through His creation. So even those who did not receive the Law or have never heard the Gospel have been given a revelation of God through nature therefore they are without excuse.

Kwa mara ya kwanza walimjua Mungu lakini hawakumtukuza kama Mungu(mstr.21).
Picha za sanamu ni matokeo ya kuukataa ukweli na kutomtukuza Mungu.Mwanadamu ameshaa abudu sana kiumbe kuliko muumba.Kwasababu ya hiyo Mungu aliwatoa zaidi kwenda kwenye upendo wenye kutia aibu.Kutia aibu humaanisha kutokuwa na neema,fedheha,aibu.
Stifler anasema: mtu alimjua Mungu lakini alikataa kumwabudu.Ibada ya sanamu ilifuata kama ulazima wa fiziolojia.Mtu amebadilishaje utukufu wa Mungu?
Mtu wa kufa-Apollo wa wagiriki.
Ndege-Tai wa Warumi.
Wanyama wanne-wenye miguu-Ni mafahali wa kimisri.
Vitu vitambavyo-Nyoka wa ashuru.
Neno;badilika humaanisha kuacha kitu kimoja kwa ajili yakingine,kubadilishana kitu kwa kingine.( Zab 106:20).Mungu aliwainua na kuwageuza zaidi.1:24-32They once knew God but did not glorify Him as God (v.21).
Graven images are the result of rejecting truth and not glorifying God. Man has worshipped the creature more than the creator. Because of this God gave them over to vile affections. Vile means disgrace, reproach, or shame.
Stifler says: &quot;Man knew God and refused to worship Him. Idolatry followed as a physiological necessity.&quot; How did man change the glory of God?
Mortal man - Apollo of the Greeks.
Birds - Eagle of the Romans.
Four-footed beasts - Bulls of the Egyptians.
Creeping things - serpent of the Assyrians.
The word &quot;change&quot; means to forsake one thing for another, to change one thing into another. ( Psalm 106:20).
God gave them up, and turned them over. 1:24-32

Stifler anasema:chochote kilicho cha maadili kiko hapa duniani kwasababu,sio kwa asili ya mwanadamu bali ni kuzuia nguvu ya Mungu.
Wema mkubwa walikuwanao kwa mara kwanza sasa umegeuka kuwa uharibifu.uharibifu wao na hatia uko wazi na hukumu imeandaliwa.Wote wafanyao hayo wanasitahili kifo;Kwa hiyo Mungu aliwaacha! sio kwa kutokuonyesha hisia bali ni kwa uhalisi.Kwasababu wao walimwacha Mungu naye aliwaacha!mara tatu tunasoma kuwa Mungu aliwaacha. Stiflersays: &quot;Whatever morality there is in the world is due, not to human nature but to the restraining power of God.&quot; 
The great good they once had is now turned to great corruption. Their corruption and guilt is clear and the judgment is set. &quot;&hellip;They which commit such things are worthy of death&hellip;&quot;
Wherefore God gave them up not passively but actually. Because they forsook God He gave them up! Three times we read that &quot;God gave them up.&quot;

### Kugeukia:unajisi,tamaa za mioyo yao.Mstr.24-25

Turn to: uncleanness, lusts of their own hearts. Vs. 24-25

### Waligeukia:akili ya kukataa,au vitu visiofaa.Mstr 26-28Turned to: a reprobate mind, things not convenient. Vs. 26-28

Wale ambawo hawakumfahamu Mungu katika fahamu zao wamepewa kuwa na akili isio faa zaidi.Hawa walikuwa walikuwa na ujuzi wa Mungu,bali waliukataa huo ujuzi.Kuchukia humaanisha mtu aliyekataa na kutupilia mbali.Na Mungu aliwacha wapotee katika akili ya kuchukia;akili yenye utupu wa bure,usiofaa,haina uzuri huepuka ujuzi wa ukweli wote na hukumu;kutoweza kufikiango cha kuthibitisha kile ambacho ni chema kikwelii,au kutokuthibisha kile ambacho ni kiuovu;akili ambayo imepoteza dhamira yote vitu na haithibishwi na Mungu,na watu wote walio wema:-Ufafanuzi wa Biblia ya Gili kuna kionyeshi ambacho huonyesha Mungu atamkatilia mwanadamu mbali yule ambayo hukataa uguso wa roho mtakatifu.Those who did not retain God in their knowledge are given over to a reprobate mind. These had knowledge of God, but rejected that knowledge. Reprobate means one who is rejected or cast away. God gave them over to a reprobate mind; a vain empty mind, worthless, good for nothing devoid of all true knowledge and judgment; incapable of approving what is truly good, or of disapproving that which is evil; a mind that has lost all conscience of things, and is disapproved of by God, and all good men: - Gill Bible Exposition There is a point when God will cut off a man that rejects the conviction of the Holy Ghost.

Ubasha kwa wazi hushutumiwa kama dhambi.Maandiko matakatifu yako wazi katika kuulezea huu uovu wa dhambi.Dhambi hii itachochea ghadhabu ya Mungu.Hii dhambi ni tokeo la kumktaa Mungu.Homosexuality is plainly denounced as sin. The Scripture is quite clear in the description of this wicked sin. This sin will invoke the wrath of God.This sin is result of rejecting God.

War 1:26-27Maana, ndugu zangu, angalieni mwito wenu, ya kwamba si wengi wenye hekima ya mwilini, si wengi wenye nguvu, si wengi wenye cheo walioitwa;
 27 bali Mungu aliyachagua mambo mapumbavu ya dunia awaaibishe wenye hekima; tena Mungu alivichagua vitu dhaifu vya dunia ili aviaibishe vyenye nguvu;
Romans 1:26-27&mdash; For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

Kujazwa na kutokuwa haki.1:29-31
Wamejawa na udhalimu wa kila namna, uovu na tamaa na ubaya; wamejawa na husuda, na uuaji, na fitina, na hadaa; watu wa nia mbaya, wenye kusengenya,
 30 wenye kusingizia, wenye kumchukia Mungu, wenye jeuri, wenye kutakabari, wenye majivuno, wenye kutunga mabaya, wasiowatii wazazi wao,
 31 wasio na ufahamu, wenye kuvunja maagano, wasiopenda jamaa zao, wasio na rehema;
To being filled with all unrighteousness. 1:29-31
all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness-(vicious) full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection,, implacable-(never satisfied) unmerciful


## Hatia ya kidini/ ya kiyahudi 2:1-29Jewish/Religious Guilt &mdash; 2:1-29

(Wenye**katika**sheria wanastahili ghadhabu ya Mungu)(Sinners **Within** the Law are Deserving of God&apos;s Wrath)

Warumi sura ya pili inazungumzzia juu ya myahudi mwenye hatia au hatia ya mtu wa kidini.Myahudi aliyekataa nuru ya Ufunuo.Katika sura hii tunaona wayahudi wakiwalaumu wengine,kama mafarisayo walivyofanya.Vilevile sura hii inazungumzia kuhusu tohara ya moyo,ambayo ni ya muhimu sana.Romans chapter two talks about the guilty Jew or the guilty religious person. The Jew refused to obey The Light of Revelation. In this chapter we see the Jew condemning others, just as the Pharisees did. This chapter also talks about the circumcision of the heart, which is most important.

### MUNGU HAHESHIMIWI NA WATU 2:1-16

Neno la ufunguo kwa sura hii:kwahiyo unganisha sura hii na sura ya kwanza.Wale ambao wangeweza kuhukumu kati ya haki na uovu wangekuwa kwa ujumla katika makubaliano na hukumu ya watu wa dunia katika sura ya kwanza.Wale wanaojidhani wao ni wakimaadili mema wawe wayahudi au wamataifa kwa urahisi wangeweza kuwahukumu walimwengu,lakini hapa Paulo anawashitaki wanafiki wa kidini ambao wameshajihukumu wenyewe.Paulo anwatambulisha wale ambao ni wenye haki kibinafsi.

GOD IS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS			2:1-16

The opening word of the chapter: therefore connects this chapter to the first chapter. Those who could judge between right and wrong would have been totally in agreement with the condemnation of the heathen in Chapter 1. Those who considered themselves morally good whether Jew or Gentile could easily condemn the heathen, but here Paul charges the religious hypocrites that they have condemned themselves.
 Paul is addressing those who were self righteous.

#### Wale wanao hukumu wengine na wao wanafanya kitu kilekile wamejihukumu wenyewe.Mst.1Those who judge others and do the same things have condemned themselves. &mdash; Vs. 1

Mtu wa maadili hujihesabia haki mwenyewe akisema kuwa yeye sio mbaya kama wengine.Mtu anaye wahukumu wengine kwa ajili ya kuvunja sheria,wakati yeye mwenyewe pia anaivunja bila kuilinda.Huyu anajihukumu mwenyewe kwa maneno aliowahukumu wengine.Moral man justifies himself saying he is not as bad as others. The man that condemns another for breaking the law and himself as well breaks the law is without a defense. This man condemns himself with the words he condemns another.

##### Kuhukumu kwa haki ni kufanya maamzi au uthamani juu uhakika kwenye mkono.Hukumu kama kanuni sio mbaya.

Wakristo wanapaswa kufanya hukumu ya haki.

To judge rightly is to make a decision or an evaluation based on the facts at hand. Judgment as a principle is not wrong.

Christians should make righteous judgment.

> Yohn 7:24 Basi msihukumu hukumu ya macho tu, bali ifanyeni hukumu iliyo ya haki.
Ni mnafiki anaonywa kwa ajili hukumu.
John 7:24&mdash;Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

It is the hypocrite who is warned of judging.

##### Wale wanao hukumu wengine wakijidhania wao ni wa kimaadili mema.
Wale ambao wanahukumu na huku wao hufanya kitu kilekile wanahukumiwa na hukumu yao ileile.Huu ndio ufafanuzi wa mnafiki.kwa mfano kama mtu akimwona mtu akiiba nakutambua kuwa hicho ni kitu kibaya kuiba watakuwa wameshaafanya hukumu kuwa kuiba ni kitu kibaya.Mtu anayemhukumu mwingine kwa ajili ya kuvunja sheria wakati huo huo yeye amevunja sheria hana usalama.Huyu anajihukumu mwenyewe kwa maneno anayokusudia kuwahukumu wengine.Tumeona hapa ukinzani wa hukumu ya mwanadamu na uharibifu wa mtu kwenye maamzi,lakini katika mstr wa pili inatangaza kwamba hukumu ya Mungu ni kulingana na ukweli sio kinyume na kundi hili au lile,bali kwa wale ambao wamejihushisha katika mambo yale.Hukumu ya Mungu ni kulingana na ukweli pasipo upendeleo,na kwa uhalisi.Mtu anaweza kuisikia mjasiri na kuwa na hakika na mahali pake mwenyewe,kwa wakati anapowahukumu wengine,lakini pasipo shaka na ulinzi--usioisha-- wakati hukumu ya Mungu itakapokuja.
 #####Those who judge others consider themselves to be morally good.

Those who judge and do the same thing are condemned by their own judgment. This is the definition of a hypocrite. For example if someone sees someone steal something and then evaluates that it is wrong to steal they have made a judgment that stealing is wrong. The man that condemns another for breaking the law while at the same time he as well breaks the law is without a defense. This man condemns himself with the words he intends to condemn another. We see here the inconsistency of human judgment and man&apos;s biased decision-making, but in verse two it is declared that God&apos;s judgment is according to truth against not just this group or that group, but against those that commit &quot;such things.&quot; God&apos;s judgment is according to truth, unbiased, and absolute. A man may feel self-confident and sure of his own place at the time he judges another, but without a doubt he is without a defense--inexcusable--when the judgment of God comes.

### Kanuni za hukumu za Mungu Mstr.2- 16

 The Principles of God&apos;s Judgment &mdash; Vs.2- 16

#### Hukumu ya Mungu ni kweli.mstr.2.
Tunaona hukumu ya mwanadamu isio sawa na ufanyaji waamuzi ulio na upendeleo,lakini katika msitari wa pili inatangaza kuwa hukumu ya Mungu ni kulingana na ukweli,sio dhidi ya kikundi hiki au kile,bali ni kwa wale wanao jihusisha na mambo kama hayo.
Hukumu ya Mungu nikulinga na ukweli haina upendeleo,na ni halisi.Mwanadamu anaweza kujisikia kuridhika na kuwa na hakika na mahali pake kwa wakati anapo mhukumu mwingine,na bila shaka yeye yuko yuko bila kinga ya kutosamehewa wakati hukumu ya Mungu  itakapokuja.  God&apos;s judgment is true.			v. 2
We see the inconsistency of human judgment and man&apos;s biased decision-making, but in verse two it is declared that God&apos;s judgment is according to truth, against not just this group or that group, but against those that commit &quot;such things.&quot;
God&apos;s judgment is according to truth, unbiased, and absolute. A man may feel self-confident and sure of his own place at the time he judges another, but without a doubt he is without a defense--inexcusable--when the judgment of God comes.

#### hukumu ya Mungu ni ya adili.mstr. 3-11
 God&apos;s judgment is impartial. 		v. 3-11

Mstr. 4 Wema wa Mungu huwaongoza wanadamu kwenye toba**.Watu mara nyingi huitikia kwa kiburi kwenye huruma ya Mungu.Wakati Mungu haleti hukumu ya moja kwa moja wahijidhania kuwa wataepuka na kuikimbia mbali,lakini kwa kufanya hivyo wanadharau wema wa Mungu,usitahimilifu,uvumilivu.Hawana mpepesuko wa kufahamu kwamba kucheleweshwa kwa adhabu wao wanafurahia wema wa Mungu unaowaongoza kwenye toleo la nafasi ya TOBA.Mungu hafurahishwi katika kuwaangamiza wanadamu kwa hasira,lakini shauku yake ni kwamba kuwaona wanadamu wakiokolewa na hiyo ingemaanisha kwamba baadhi wangeenda motoni.
Paulo kwa wazi anaelezea kuwa wakati mioyo migumu hufikiri kiburi kwamba yeye ameshaepuka,badala ya kuchukua faida ya huruma ya wema wa Mungu yeye katika matoeo kinyume hujihfadhi, na kujiwekeza,kinyume chake mwenyewe kwa ghadhabu ya Mungu.Katika wakati ambao msamaha unatolewa,mioyo migumu isotubu  huhifadhi ghadhabu,na hukumu.Wanapokea hazina ya maangamizi kinyume na ahadi ya hazina ya haki.Mungu kamwe sio kipofu wala mkimya.Mungu ni mvumilivu,lakini pia atahukumu kwa haki kila mtu kulingana na matendo yake.Hukumu ya haki ya Mungu atawazawadia watiifu kwa uzima wa milele,lakini atawahukumu wasio tii kwa dhiki na kusaga meno.(War.2:7, 9; 5:21; 6:17, 23)-1:30; 10:21. 4 &quot;**The goodness of God leads men to repentance**.&quot; Men too often respond so vainfully to the mercy of God. When God does not bring instantaneous judgment men often imagine they have escaped and have &quot;gotten away&quot; with it, but in so doing they despise God&apos;s goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering patience. They are without a flicker of understanding that the reprieve they enjoy is the goodness of God to lead them to and provide space for REPENTANCE. God is not interested in simply destroying men in anger, but His desire is that men would be saved and that could mean for some by as it were fire.
Paul clearly explains that while the hard and impenitent heart imagines vainly that he has escaped, instead of taking advantage of the mercy and goodness of God he to the opposite effect stores up, treasures up, against himself the wrath of God.
In a time when pardon is provided, the hard hearted and impenitent store up only more wrath and condemnation. They heap up treasures of destruction over a promise of treasures of righteousness. God is not blind and neither has He gone soft. God is longsuffering, but He also will judge righteously EVERY man according to HIS DEEDS.
The righteous judgment of God will reward the obedient with eternal life, but will judge the disobedient with tribulation and anguish. (Ro.2:7, 9; 5:21; 6:17, 23)-1:30; 10:21

>War 2:6,Yeye atakayewapa kila mtu kulingana na matendo yake:
>War 2:11,Kwa maana hakuna heshima ya watu kwa Mungu.> Romans 2:6&mdash;Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
> Romans 2:11&mdash; For there is no respect of persons with God.

Hii humaanisha kwamba Mungu ni mwadilifu katika shughuli zake zote na wanadamu pamoja na hukumu yake.This means that God is totally impartial in all His dealings with men including His judgment. 

#### Mstr.12 Kwa kuwa wote waliokosa pasipo sheria watapotea pasipo sheria, na wote waliokosa, wenye sheria, watahukumiwa kwa sheria.
Those who have sinned without the Law will perish without it. -Vs. 12

Paulo anawakilisha ukweli katika mstr wa kumi na mbili,wale wasio na sheria watakufa pasipo sheria,lakini itawahukumu wale walifanya dhambi katika sheria.Haitoshi kuifahamu sheria, lazima KUITIMIZA.Paul presents a truth in verse twelve, those that have not the law will die without the law, but the law will judge those that have sinned in the law. It is not enough to know about the law, but you must DO it.
Ujinga wa sheria hautawaokoa watu wamataifa.Ignorance of the Law will not save the Gentile.
Hii inarejea kwa watu wamataifa ambao hawakuipokea sheria ya Musa.Ingawa wao hawakuwa na sheria ya Musa,watu wote wamekwisha pewa habari kuhusu uumbaji na kuwa na sheria ya Mungu,iliofunuliwa na dhamiri ya mwanadamu,ilioandikwa katika moyo.Paulo ameshaonyesha kwamba watu wote wako chini ya hukumu kwa hiyo kuna hitaji la wokovu.This refers to the Gentiles who had not received the Law of Moses. Even though they did not have Moses&apos;s law all men have been given the testimony of creation and have the law of God, revealed by the conscience of man, written on the heart. Paul has already shown that all men are condemned and in need of Salvation.

Wale ambao wamefanya dhambi katika sheria watahukumiwa  kwa sheria.Those who have sinned in the Law will be judged by the Law.
Yeye husimama mahali pa faraja kuu na haki yake kwa yeye ANAJUA sheria,lakini HAKUNA HAKI KWA KUIJUA SHERIA.He stands in this place of great self-confidence and self righteousness because he KNOWS the law, but THERE IS NO RIGHTEOUSNESS IN just KNOWING THE LAW.
Paulo anasema mojo kwa moja na kusisitiza pointi yake,wewe uhubiriye kwamba mtu asiibe nawe unaiba?Paul speaks directly to emphasize his point, &quot;Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?&quot;

Paulo anajiwakilisha kama mmataifa mwenye hatia kwasababu yeye hakuifanya sheria na sio kwamba yeye hakuwa na sheria,kama wayahudi wafanyavyo,na wayahudi pia hawakusamehewa kwasababu ya hatia yao walionao na sio sheria,na wao pia watahukumiwa kwa kutoifanya sheria.Ushuhda wao ni uovu,hujivuna kwakuijua sheria,lakini kutomheshimu Mungu ni KUVUNJA sheria. Hii hurejea kwa wayahudi ambao walipokea sheria ya Musa.Umiliki wa sheria hautawaokoa wamataifa,wayahudi watahukumiwa kwa sheria ambayo ilitolewa kwao.Paul is clearly presenting that just as the Gentile is guilty because he DOES NOT the law and not that because he has not the law, as the Jews do, so also are the Jews not pardoned from their guilt because they have and know the law, but they as well are judged for not DOING the law.
Their testimony is evil, they boast, KNOWING the law, but dishonor God, BREAKING the law.
This refers to the Jews who had received the Law of Moses.
Possession of the Law will not save the Gentiles.
The Jews will be judged by the Law that was given to them.

#### Utii ni kigezo kwa ajili ya kuhesabiwa haki.mstr-13Obedience is a requirement for justification.- Vs. 13

Wasikiaji wa sheria hawako mbele za Mungu,bali watendaji washeria watahesabiwa haki.Paulo anaulaumu unafiki wa wayahudi.Mstari huu lazima ufahamiwe katika mazingira yake,kwa maana 3:20 hutangaza kwamba kwa matendo ya sheria hakuna mwenye mwili atakaye hesabiwa haki mbele za Mungu.Mungu hahesabii haki wale ambao ni kwa matendo ya sheria,bali wale ambao ni kwanjia ya imani hukubali toleo la lilipwa kwao bila kujali wako chini ya agano la kale au jipya.Kwasababu wayahudi walikuwa hawaja tii sheria kwa hiyo watahukumiwa kwa sheria.,wayahudi wengi walikuwa wamesikia sheria ikisomwa katika sinagogi,lakini bado hawakutii kile walichosikia.Kutii sheria ilidai kutoa sadaka ya wanyama.Sheria ilijumuisha utoaji wa malipo ya dhambi kwa njia ya damu ya mnyama.Tunafahamu dhabihu hizi zilikuwa kivuli cha kifo cha Bwana Yesu msalabani ambacho kilikubaliwa tu na Mungu kama mfano wake yeye aliyekuwa aje kulipa gharama yote kwa ajili ya dhambi za wanadamu wote.Mwanadamu amehesabiwa haki tu kwa njia ya damu ya yesu Kristo.Chini ya Agano la kale myahudi angehasabiwa haki kwa kuitii sheria ambayo ilijumuisha dhabihu ya mnyama kwa ajili ya dhambi.Matendo sheria kamwe hayakuweza kumhesabia mtu haki.The hearers of the law are not just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
Paul is condemning the hypocrisy of the Jews. This verse must be understood within its context, for 3:20 declares by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in the sight of God. God does not justify those who perform the works of the law, but to those who through faith accept the provision that has been afforded them whether under the Old or New covenant.
Because the Jews had not obeyed the Law they will be condemned by the law. Many of the Jews had heard the law read in the synagogue, yet they did not obey what they had heard.
Obeying the law required the sacrificing of animals. The law included provision for the atonement of sins through the blood of an animal. We understand these sacrifices were a shadow of Jesus death upon the cross which were only accepted by God as a figure of Him who was to come and pay the price in full for the sins of all humanity. Man has only been justified by the blood of Jesus Christ. Under the Old Covenant the Jew could be justified if he obeyed the law which included animal sacrifice for sin. The works of the law have never justified man. 
Kuhesabiwa kwasasa inatolea kwa imani katika Kristo Yesu.Kristo ni utimilifu wa sheria.Chini ya agano la neema watu wanaweza kuhesabiwa haki  kwa njia ya Yesu Kristo.Dhabihu za sheria zilitazama mbele kwenye ukombozi kwa njia ya damu ya Kristo.Na kuhesabiwa haki ambayo ni kwa njia ya imani.Kwa hiyo leo njia pekee ya mtu kuweza kumtii Mungu ni kukubali malipo ya Yesu Kristo.Justification is now only provided by faith in Jesus Christ. Christ is the fulfillment of the law. Under the New Covenant of Grace men can only be justified through Jesus Christ. The sacrifices of the law looked forward to redemption through Christ&apos;s blood and justification which is by faith. So today the only way man can obey God is to accept the atonement of Jesus Christ. 

> Gal 3:24Hivyo torati imekuwa kiongozi kutuleta kwa Kristo, ili tuhesabiwe haki kwa imani.
Galatians 3:24&mdash;Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

### Sheria ya Mungu imeandikwa kwenye mioyo ya wanadamu.Mstr.14-16The Law of God is written on the hearts of men. - Vs. 14-16

#### Wamataifa kiasili wanaweza kufanya kile kilichoingizwa katika torati.The Gentiles can by nature do that which is contained in the law.

Je mstr 12 unamaniisha wamataifa hawawezi kuhesabiwa haki kwasababu yeye hakupewa sheria ambayo yeye anaweza kuitii kama wayahudi wafanyavyo? Hapana, kwakweli sio.Mmataifa kwa asili anaweza kufanya vitu vilivyoko katika torati pasipo kuwa na hiyo sheria kwasababu Mungu anampango na kila mtu,dhamiri vivyo hivyo kadiri watu wanavyoilinda na kuihifadhi inakuwa sheria ndani yao katika  maana halisi na ukweli wa kifungu.Sheria hii imeandikwa katika MIOYO yao na dhamiri yao zinashuhudia.Does verse 12 mean that a Gentile cannot be justified because he has not been given the law that he may obey it as the Jews have? No, absolutely not. The Gentile may do by nature the things contained in the law without ever having it because God has placed in every man a conscience whereas long as men guard it and keep it are a law unto themselves in the proper and true sense of the phrase. This law is written in their HEARTS and their conscience bears witness to it.
Paulo anakabiliana na udhuru wa mwanadamu,kujibu swali:Jinsi gani Mungu anaweza kuhukumu mataifa ambao hawakuwa na sheria?Mungu atamhukumu mtu kulingana na ukweli ambao aliutoa kwake.Wamataifa wanaotenda dhambi watapotea,lakini sheria ya Musa haitatumika kama kiwango cha hukumu dhidi yao.Watu wote  bado walikuwa na sheria ya dhamiri zao na ushuhuda wa uumbaji.Mtenda dhambi yuko chini ya hukumu hata kama bila sheria ya Musa.Mahakama ya kiyahudi ilihusisha torati,hakimu na shahidi.Kwa hiyo pia mmataifa anayo torati katika moyo wake,dhamiri yake kama hakimu,na ushahihdi wa mawazo yake unamhukumu.Paul is confronting the excuses of man, to answer the question: how can God judge the Gentiles who did not have the Law? God will judge a man based on the truth that has been afforded to him. Gentiles who sin will perish, but the Law of Moses will not be used as a standard of judgment against them. All men still had the law of their conscience and the testimony of creation. The sinner is under condemnation with or without Moses&apos;s law.
The court of the Jew consisted of the law, a judge, and a witness. So too the Gentile has the law on his heart, his conscience as a judge, and the witness of his thoughts accusing or excusing him.

Mungu alimuumba mtu akiwa na dhamiri ambayo ni uwezo wa asili wa mema na ubaya.
Mungu tu ndio mwenye kiwango cha maadili.Hakuna sheria moja kwa ajili ya wayahudi na nyingine kwa ajili ya wamataifa.Hii ni katika rejea ya  mstr uliotangulia ambao unasema Mungu hutaka utii kwa sheria.Huu utii sio tu kwamba ulifikiwa na wayahudi;Paulo aanaonyesha kwamba watu wote wana torati ya Mungu ilioandikwa mioyoni mwao kwa wote wayahudi na wamataifa.Ni watendaji wa torati ndio wataohesabiwa haki.God created man with a conscience which is a natural sense of right and wrong.
God has only one standard of morality. There is not one law for the Jew and another law for the Gentiles. 
This is in reference to the previous verse which states God requires obedience to the law. This obedience was not only attainable by the Jews; Paul is showing that all men have God&apos;s law written on their hearts both Jew and Gentile. It is the doers of this law who will be justified.

#### Watu wote wanawajibika na sheria ya maadili ya Mungu.All men are accountable to the moral law of God.

Sheria ya dhamiri hukaa katika hukumu ya watu.Kwakuwa wote wamevunja sheria ya maadili;wote wamehukumiwa.Tiba pekee kwa ajili ya mwanadamu ni kuhesabiwa haki kwa njia ya imani.The law of conscience sits in judgment of all men.
Since all men have broken the moral law; all men are condemned.
The only remedy for man is justification by faith.

##### Mungu atahukumu siri za wanadamu.-mstr.16God will judge the secrets of men. - V. 16

Watu watahukumiwa na Yesu Kristo.-Yoh.5:27Men will be judged by Jesus Christ. - Jn.5:27

Injili ya paulo sio kiwango cha hukumu ya Mungu.Injili yangu;rejea kwenye  ufundishaji na kuhubiri kwa Paulo.Hukumu ya haki ya Mungu ni kiingilio kinachofaa kwa ajili ya injili iliohubiriwa na Paulo.Paul&apos;s Gospel is not the standard of God&apos;s judgment. &quot;My Gospel&quot; refers to the teaching and preaching of Paul. The righteous judgment of God is an essential ingredient of the Gospel Paul preached.

### MYAHUDI ASIYE MWAMINIFU YUKO CHINI YA HUKUMU ;Mstr.17-25THE UNFAITHFUL JEW IS UNDER CONDEMNATION &mdash; Vs. 17-25

#### Wayahudi walitua kwenye sheria.Mstr.17-18The Jews rested in the Law. Vs. 17-18

##### Wayahudi walidai kusamehewa kutoka kwenye hukumu iliojikita kwenye urithi.The Jews claimed to be exempt from condemnation based on heritage.

Wakati Yesu anawalaumu wayahudi,wao walijibu:sisi ni wa uzao wa Ibrahimu; Yesu aliitikia:ikiwa ninyi wa uzao wa Ibrahimu,mngefanya kazi za Ibrahimu.Yoh 8:33-39 Wayahudi waliamini wao wangepokea uzima wa milele juu ya stahili ya kuwa myahudi na agano la tohara.Maandiko ya zamani ya kirabi huelezea kwamba mtu aliyetahiriwa hatapotea.Wayahudi walikuwa na mapokeo kwamba Ibrahimu alisimama kwenye malango ya kuzimu kuhakikisha kwamba hakuna mtu aliyetahiriwa ambaye ingia hapo.When Jesus condemned the Jews, they replied: We be Abrahams seed; Jesus responded: if ye were Abraham&apos;s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.&mdash;Jn. 8:33-39 The Jews believed they would receive eternal life on the merit of being a Jew and the covenant of circumcision. The old Rabbinical writings state that no circumcised man will be lost. The Jews had a tradition that Abraham stood at the gates of hell to insure that no circumcised man was ever cast there.

##### ujuzi wa sheria hauwezi kumuokoa myahudi.Knowledge of the law cannot save the Jew.

Myahudi anayejivuna katika sheria huamini yeye ni kiongozi kwa kipofu,bali yeye mwenyewe ni kipofu.Kwamba yeye anaijua njia,kwamba hakuna mwingine ajuaye zaidi.Anasimama katika sehemu hii kwa ujasiri mkubwa wa binafsi kwasababu yeye ANAJUA sheria,lakini HAKUNA HAKI KATIKA KUJUA SHERIA.Paulo naongea mojo kwa moja kwa msisitizo kuelekea pointi yake,wewe uhubiriye kwamba mtu asiibe,mbona wewe waiba?Paulo kwa wazi anawakilisha kwamba eti mmataifa anahatia kwasababu hafanyi matakwa ya sheria bali si hivyo kwa kuwa yeye hana sheria,kama wayahudi wafanyavyo,vilevile wayahudi hawasamehewi hatia yao kwasababu wanao sheria na wanaijua,bali hatahivyo wanahukumiwa kwasababu hawatimizi.Ujasiri wao ni ujinga wa moyo kwakuwa wao ni vipofu na wanaongoza kipofu.The Jew that boasts in the law believes he is a guide for the blind, but is blind himself. That is, he believes he knows the way, and no one else does. He stands in this place of great self-confidence because he KNOWS the law, but THERE IS NO RIGHTEOUSNESS IN KNOWING THE LAW. Paul speaks directly to emphasize his point, &quot;Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?&quot; Paul is clearly presenting that just as the Gentile is guilty because he DOES NOT the law and not that because he has not the law as the Jews do, so also are the Jews not pardoned from their guilt because they have and know the law, but they as well are judged for not DOING the law. Their self-confidence is fool hearty for they are the blind leading the blind.

#### Wayahudi wanamini wao wako juu ya wamataifa.Mstr.19-25The Jews believed they were superior to the Gentiles. Vs. 19-25

##### Wamataifa walidhaniwa kuwa ni vipofu na wajinga.The Gentiles were considered blind and ignorant.

Maswali haya kuhusiana na kuongoza kipofu na kuelekeza watoto wachanga.Paulo anakabiliana na mpango wa kiyahudi wa wakati.Paulo alikuwa anapunguza mambo myahudi kuonyesha hukumu yake na hitaji la kweli la kuhesabiwa haki ambayo ni kwanjia ya imani.Thus the questions concerning the guiding of the blind and instructing the babes. Paul is confronting the Jewish mindset of the time. Paul was disarming the objections of the Jew to show his condemnation and need of true justification which is through faith.
##### Paulo anahoji uaminifu wa wayahudi kwa sheria.Paul questions the faithfulness of the Jews to the Law.

Alikuwa anaendesha ujumbe wake kwenda kwenye dhamiri zao.Wewe uwaambiaye wengine usifanye dhambi:wakati huo huo wewe wafanya dhambi, unajivuna katika sheria na kutomheshimu Mungu kwa kuvunja sheria.He was driving his message to the conscience of the Jew. You who tell others not to sin: do you sin? You boast in the law yet dishonor God by breaking the law. 

#### Myahudi wa kweli ni yule ambaye ni kwa NDANI (moyoni,rohoni)Mstr,26-29 The True &quot;Jew&quot; is one that is so INWARDLY (heart, spirit) Vs. 26-29.

##### Tohara ilikuwa ni ishara ya kuondoa hali dhambi.Circumcision was a sign of the cutting away of the flesh.

##### Mmataifa asiyetahiriwa aliyetii sheria ya Mungu alipata faida zaidi kuliko myahudi aliye tahiriwa asiyetii sheria.The uncircumcised Gentile who obeyed God&apos;s law had more profit than the circumcised Jew who disobeyed it.

##### Tohara ni ya rohoCircumcision is of the heart.

Kwa swala la kuhesabiwa haki sio juu ya mtu aliyezali akiwa myahudi au mmataifa,wala aliyetahiriwa au la,au kama anasheria au la bali moyo wake unatohara?ana ugumu wa moyo na dhambi imeondolewa toka moyoni mwake,Paulo kwa hitimisha anasema myahaudi wa kweli ana imani kwa ndani,ambaye moyo wake umeshabadilishwa,sio yule ambaye kwa inje anafuata sherehe kwa njia ya kimwili.Kila myahudi anahitaji kuongeza kwenye tohara yake ya kimwili,tohara ya moyo kwa njia ya toba na maisha yaliyo badilika.The issue for justification is not over if a man was born Jew or Gentile, whether he has been circumcised or not, or if he has the law or not, but has his HEART been circumcised? Has the hardness, impenitence, and sin been cut out of his heart? Paul concludes a true Jew is one who has faith inwardly, whose heart has been changed, and not one who merely follows outward ceremonies in the flesh. Every Jew needs to add to his physical circumcision a circumcision of the heart through repentance and a changed life.

## HitimishoConclusion

> War 3:9-19 Ni nini basi? Tu bora kuliko wengine? La! Hata kidogo. Kwa maana tumekwisha kuwashitaki Wayahudi na Wayunani ya kwamba pia wamekuwa chini ya dhambi;
 10 kama ilivyoandikwa, ya kwamba, Hakuna mwenye haki hata mmoja.
 11 Hakuna afahamuye; Hakuna amtafutaye Mungu.
 12 Wote wamepotoka, wameoza wote pia; Hakuna mtenda mema, la! Hata mmoja.
 13 Koo lao ni kaburi wazi, Kwa ndimi zao wametumia hila. Sumu ya fira i chini ya midomo yao.
 14 Vinywa vyao vimejaa laana na uchungu.
 15 Miguu yao ina mbio kumwaga damu.
 16 Uharibifu na mashaka yamo njiani mwao.
 17 Wala njia ya amani hawakuijua.
 18 Kumcha Mungu hakupo machoni pao.
Romans 3:9-18&mdash;What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;Ro 3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. 12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: 14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: 15 Their feet are swift to shed blood: 16 Destruction and misery are in their ways: 17 And the way of peace have they not known: 18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.
