# Ukataaji wa Israel kwa utawala wa Mungu(9:6-29)
The Rejection of Israel and God's Sovereignty (9:6-29)

## Mwisraeli wa kweli ni kulingana na ahadi mst 6-10
The True Israel is According to the Promise, v. 6-10

Wengi wa waisrael wamekosea lengo.Kristo ni ukamilifu wa sheria,lakini waisrael wamejikwa kwake kama kwenye jiwe na kjishikisha kwe sheria na dini.Wanadhani wao ni wana wa Mungu kwasababu wao ni wana wa Ibrahimu na Isaka na kwamba wao ndio sheria ilifunuliwa kwa ajili yao.The majority of Israel has missed the point. Christ is the fulfillment of the law, but Israel stumbles over him as if a stone and hold to their laws and religion. They think they are the children of God because they are the children of Abraham and Isaac and that they are the ones to whom the law was revealed.

Sababu ambayo wayahudi kama taifa walimkataa masiha(Kristo)inaibua swali kwamba "je neno la Mungu lilishindwa?" "je Mungu alishindwa kutimiza ahadi zake?" ni jinsi gani Paulo anajibu maswali haya?katika fungu la misitari hii Paulo anaujasiri kwamba kukataa injili kwa waisrael sio kitu Mungu anaweza kupandikiza tena!The fact that the Jews as a nation rejected the Messiah (Christ) raises the question "Did the Word of God fail?" "Did God fail to carry out His promises"? How does Paul answer these questions? In these next verses Paul is confident that Israel's rejection of the gospel is not unanimous and not permanent&mdash;God is able to graft back in again!

Mwiisraeli wa kweli ni mteule,sio kwa mbegu ya asili.Tunaona mpango wa Mungu ambao haujafungwa.Sio kila mtu ambaye hajazaliwa katika taifa la Israel ametengwa na Israel ya kiroho.Wana waisraeli ni wale tu wa kimwili,bali wana wa ahadi ni wana wa Mungu.(Yoh3:6 "walio zaliwa kwa Roho").Kanisa la Agano jipya lina rejelewa kama israeli wa Mungu(Galatians 6:16) kwasababu ya imani yao kwa Mungu na mwanae,Yesu kristo na sio kwasababu ya ukoo wao.The real Israel is the elect, not a natural seed. We see the plan of God as it unfolds. Not everyone that is born a part of the nationality of Israel are a part of Spiritual Israel. The children of the Israel are only children of the flesh, but the children of the promise are the children of God. (John 3:6 "born of the Spirit"). The New Testament Church is referred to as &quot;the Israel of God&quot; (Galatians 6:16) because of their faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ&mdash;not because of their family lineage.

> 
War 6 Si kana kwamba neno la Mungu limetanguka. Maana hawawi wote Waisraeli walio wa uzao wa Israeli.
 7 Wala hawawi wote wana kwa kuwa wazao wa Ibrahimu, bali, Katika Isaka wazao wako wataitwa;
 8 yaani, si watoto wa mwili walio watoto wa Mungu, bali watoto wa ile ahadi wanahesabiwa kuwa wazao.
 9 Kwa maana neno la ahadi ni hili, Panapo wakati huu nitakuja, na Sara atakuwa na mwana.
 10 Wala si hivyo tu, lakini Rebeka naye, akiisha kuchukua mimba kwa mume mmoja, naye ni Isaka, baba yetu,
Romans 9:6-10&mdash;Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: 7 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. 9 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son. 10 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;

> Rom 10:1-4 Ndugu zangu, nitakayo sana moyoni mwangu, na dua yangu nimwombayo Mungu, ni kwa ajili yao, ili waokolewe.
 2 Kwa maana nawashuhudia kwamba wana juhudi kwa ajili ya Mungu, lakini si katika maarifa.
 3 Kwa maana, wakiwa hawaijui haki ya Mungu, na wakitaka kuithibitisha haki yao wenyewe, hawakujitia chini ya haki ya Mungu.
 4 Kwa maana Kristo ni mwisho wa sheria, ili kila aaminiye ahesabiwe haki. Romans 10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. 3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.

## Uteuzi na nadharia sio kazi yake aliyeita, mstr. 11-13Election or Predestination is Not of Works of Him that Calleth, v. 11-13

Uteuzi umetajwa katika mistari kumi na moja.Election is mentioned in verse eleven.

>  War 9:11-13,11 (kwa maana kabla hawajazaliwa wale watoto, wala hawajatenda neno jema wala baya, ili lisimame kusudi la Mungu la kuchagua, si kwa sababu ya matendo, bali kwa sababu ya nia yake aitaye),
 12 aliambiwa hivi, Mkubwa atamtumikia mdogo.
 13 Kama ilivyoandikwa, Nimempenda Yakobo, bali Esau nimemchukia.
Romans 9:11-13&mdash;(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) 12 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

Uteuzi na nadharia sio tendo lisilo la haki la Mungu anaweza kumhesabia haki yeye atakaye na kumuhukumu atakaye.Matendo yote mema haya wezi kuwafanya wao kuwa watoto wa ahadi,bali hayo mashariti yanategemea Mungu kuonyesha huruma.Election or predestination is not an unrighteous act for God may justify whom He may and condemn whom he desires. All the good works of men cannot make them children of the promise, but that condition is dependent upon God showing mercy.

Ni muhimu kufahamu kutoka maandiko jinsi gani nadharia au uteuzi unavyo fanya kazi.It is important to understand from Scripture how predestination or election works.

Nadharia na uteuzi yana msingi juu ya ukiri wa Mungu.Yeye hujua mwisho kutokea mwanzo hujua nani atapokea na nani atakataa kabla hata ya wao kuzaliwa.Predestination and election is based upon God&apos;s foreknowledge. He knows the end from the beginning He knows who will receive and who will reject before they are even born.

> War8: 29 Maana wale aliowajua tangu asili, aliwachagua tangu asili wafananishwe na mfano wa Mwana wake, ili yeye awe mzaliwa wa kwanza miongoni mwa ndugu wengi.
Romans 8:29&mdash;For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

> William Branham alikuwa mtu wa Mungu na mhubiri wa hemani katikati ya miaka1900 alikuwa kihubiri jioni moja katika hema mwanamke moja alikuja kwenye huduma.Alisema,Ndugu Branham,mme wangu ametishia kuniuwa ikiwa nitakuja kwenye mikutano yako,tena.Yeye amekaa sasa katika gari lake akiwa anashikilia gani.Branham alitoka inje kwenda kwenye gari na kuvuta mlango wa ubavu wa abria na kukaa kiti cha mbele.Aliongea na mtu kuhusiqana na nafsi yake kwa saa moja na zaidi.Branham hakupata kuona badiliko lolote ndani ya huyo mtu,aliuliza swali la mwisho.Je unakusudi lolote kwa wakati ujao kwamba utamtumikia Mungu?Yule alipiga kelele kwamba Hakuna;Branham alimwambia kwamba sijaona sababu ya wewe kuendelea kuishi,na aligongesha vidole vyake na huyo mtu alikufa palepale kwenye kiti cha direva.was a man of God and a tent preacher in the mid 1900&apos;s. He was preaching one evening in the tent and a woman came to him near the closing of the service. She said, &quot;Brother Branham, my husband has threatened to kill me if I came to your meetings, again. He is sitting right now in his car in the parking lot holding a shotgun.&quot; Branham went out to the vehicle pulled open the passenger side door and sat down in the front seat. He plead with man concerning his soul for an hour or more. Branham, observing no change in the man, asked one final question. &quot;Do you any intention that at any time in the future you may serve God?&quot; The man arrogantly sounded a resounding, &quot;No!&quot; Branham told him that he saw no reason for him to continue living then, and snapped his fingers and the man died instantly in the driver&apos;s seat.

Baadhi wamepewa miaka 100 na wengine michache tu.Hii ni jukumu la mwanadamu kuitikia wakati wa huruma ya Mungu kumgeukia haiwezi kutokea kwa muonekano wa haraka wa mtu, bali ni lazima avutwe na Baba.Some are given 100 years and others only a few. It is man&apos;s responsibility to respond in the time of mercy for turning to God cannot happen just on a man&apos;s whim, but he must be drawn by the Father.

>Yohn 6:44 Hakuna mtu awezaye kuja kwangu, asipovutwa na Baba aliyenipeleka; nami nitamfufua siku ya mwisho.
John 6:44&mdash;No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.

## Mungu ni mwenye haki katika huruma na ugumu mstr. 14-18God is Righteous in Mercy and Hardening, v. 14-18

> Rom 9:14-1814 Tuseme nini basi? Kuna udhalimu kwa Mungu? Hasha!
 15 Maana amwambia Musa, Nitamrehemu yeye nimrehemuye, nitamhurumia yeye nimhurumiaye.
 16 Basi, kama ni hivyo, si katika uwezo wa yule atakaye, wala wa yule apigaye mbio; bali wa yule arehemuye, yaani, Mungu.
 17 Kwa maana maandiko yasema juu ya Farao, ya kwamba, Nilikusimamisha kwa kusudi hili, ili nionyeshe nguvu zangu kwako, jina langu likatangazwe katika nchi yote.
 18 Basi, kama ni hivyo, atakaye kumrehemu humrehemu, na atakaye kumfanya mgumu humfanya mgumu.
Romans 9:14-18&mdash; What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. 17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. 18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

Utawala wa Mungu umeelezwaje?Mungu ni mtawala na kwahiyo ni Mungu wa haki.How is God's sovereignty expressed? God is a sovereign God so therefore he is also a just God.

Romans 9:21&mdash;Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

linganisha na Yermia 18 "Shuka nenda kwa nyumba ya mfinyanziCompare with JEREMIAH 18 "Go Down to the Potter's House

> Yer 18:1-101 Neno hili ndilo lililomjia Yeremia, kutoka kwa Bwana, kusema,
 2 Ondoka, ukashuke mpaka nyumba ya mfinyanzi, na huko nitakusikizisha maneno yangu.
 3 Basi nikashuka mpaka nyumba ya mfinyanzi, na tazama, alikuwa akifanya kazi yake kwa magurudumu.
 4 Na chombo kile, alichokuwa akikifinyanga, kilipoharibika mkononi mwake yule mfinyanzi, alikifanyiza tena kuwa chombo kingine, kama alivyoona vema yule mfinyanzi kukifanya.
 5 Ndipo neno la Bwana likanijia, kusema,
 6 Ee nyumba ya Israeli, je! Siwezi mimi kuwatendea ninyi vile vile kama mfinyanzi huyu alivyotenda? Asema Bwana. Angalieni, kama udongo ulivyo katika mkono wa mfinyanzi, ndivyo mlivyo ninyi katika mkono wangu, Ee nyumba ya Israeli.
 7 Wakati wo wote nitakapotoa habari za taifa, na habari za ufalme, kuung'oa, na kuuvunja, na kuuangamiza;
 8 ikiwa taifa lile nililolitaja litageuka, na kuacha maovu yake nitaghairi, nisitende mabaya yale niliyoazimia kuwatenda.
 9 Na wakati wo wote nitakapotoa habari za taifa, na habari za ufalme, kuujenga na kuupanda,
 10 ikiwa watatenda maovu mbele za macho yangu, wasiitii sauti yangu, basi nitaghairi, nisitende mema yale niliyoazimia kuwatendea.
Jer 18:1-10&mdash;The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. 3 Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. 4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. 5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 6 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel. 7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; 8 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. 9 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 10 If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.

> Rom 9:25-2925 Ni kama vile alivyosema katika Hosea, Nitawaita watu wangu wale wasiokuwa watu wangu, Na mpenzi wangu yeye asiyekuwa mpenzi wangu.
 26 Tena itakuwa mahali pale walipoambiwa, Ninyi si watu wangu, Hapo wataitwa wana wa Mungu aliye hai.
 27 Isaya naye atoa sauti yake juu ya Israeli, kusema, Hesabu ya wana wa Israeli,ijapokuwa ni kama mchanga wa bahari,ni mabaki yao tu watakaookolewa.
 28 Kwa maana Bwana atalitekeleza neno lake juu ya nchi, akilimaliza na kulikata.
 29 Tena kama Isaya alivyotangulia kunena, Kama Bwana wa majeshi asingalituachia uzao, Tungalikuwa kama Sodoma, tungalifananishwa na Gomora.
Romans 9:25-29&mdash;As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. 26 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God. 27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: 28 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. 29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

### Mstr 25Verse 25

Paulo hapa,anachukua kutoka nabii Hosea(2:23) Kifungu ambacho hasahasa kiliongelea waisrael,bali hakupatta utimilifu kwa waisrael bali zaidi ya hapo inaonekana kutimilizwa kwa mataifa kupokea injliPaul here, takes from the prophet Hosea (2:23) a passage that is specifically spoken to Israel, but has not found a fulfillment in Israel but rather is seen fulfilled in the Gentiles receiving the Gospel.

> Hosea 2:23 Nami nitampanda katika nchi kwa ajili yangu mwenyewe; nami nitamrehemu yeye asiyepewa rehema; nami nitawaambia wale wasiokuwa watu wangu, Ninyi ndinyi watu wangu; nao watasema, Wewe ndiwe Mungu wangu.
Hosea 2:23 &mdash;And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.

- nayo nchi itaiitikia nafaka na divai na mafuta; nayo yataiitikia Yezreeli.(mstr.22),Uzao wa Mungu.(Yeremiah 31:27; Zek 10:9; Isa 61:3).
 
 "I will sow her" Alluding to the import of the name Jezreel (v.22), the seed of God. (Jeremiah 31:27; Zechariah 10:9; Isaiah 61:3).

Kama mahali,mji wa Nazareti,Mji Nyumbani kwa Yesu,Vile vile huitwa eneo tambarare na bonde la Esdraelon.

As a place, The city of Nazareth, Jesus' home town, was on the northern side of Jezreel. It is also called the Great Plain and the Valley of Esdraelon.

Katika Biblia mji wa Yezreeli una historia ndefu ya nguvu.Mke wa mfalme Ahabu, Yezebel,alikufa alipokuwa ametupiwa kupitia dirisha la jumba la kifalme la Yezreeli na mwili wake uliliwa na mbwa(2 Waf 9:30-35).Naboti aliuuwawa katika Yezreeli wakati alipokataa kumpa mfalme Ahabu shamba la mizabibu(1 Waf 21:1-23).  Wana wa mfale ahabu walikatwa vichwa na kutundikwa katika lango la Yezreeli(2 Waf 10:1-11).Yezreeli pia ilikuwa madhari ya vita vingi vya kibiblia:Ushindi wa Debora dhidi ya Sisera(Waaamzi 4);Ushindi wa waisraeli juu ya wamidiani na waamaleki(Waamzi 6,8)mapigano ya Yonathani na Sauli kwenye mkono wa waflisti(1 Samuel 31); Ushindi wa Misri juu ya mfalme Yosia (2 Waf 23:29).

 In the Bible, the city of Jezreel has a long, violent history. The wife of King Ahab, Jezebel, died when she was thrown from a window of Jezreel's palace, and her body was eaten by dogs (2 Kings 9:30-35). Naboth was murdered in Jezreel when he refused to give King Ahab his vineyard (1 Kings 21:1-23). King Ahab's sons were beheaded and their heads piled at the gates of Jezreel (2 Kings 10:1-11). Jezreel was also the scene of many biblical battles: Deborah's victory over Sisera (Judges 4); the Israelites' victory over the Midianites and the Amalekites (Judges 6&mdash;8); Saul and Jonathan's defeat at the hand of the Philistines (1 Samuel 31); Egypt's victory over King Josiah (2 Kings 23:29).

Bonde la Yezreel sasa inchi nzuri kwa kilimo,mahali ambapo ngano,pamba,nafaka,na alzeti hukua,na mahali pa malisho ya ng'ombe na kondoo.Bonde la Yezreel liliitwa "bonde la Miggido"(Miggido inapatika katika bonde la Yezreel.Meggido humaanisha kuchinja au kukata.)wengine huamini kuwa huenda ni mathari ya vita ya Hermagedoni,kulingana na kifungu  cha ufunuo kinavyosema "(Ufunuo 16:16-21).  Wakawakusanya hata mahali paitwapo kwa Kiebrania, Har-Magedoni.Arimagedoni ni muunganiko wa maneno har,humaanisha mlima au mlima wa mapigano,mggidown,ambalo kwa kiingereza ni Meggido."The Jezreel Valley is now a beautiful farmland, where wheat, cotton, corn, and sunflowers are grown, and herds of sheep and cattle graze. The Valley of Jezreel is also called "The Valley of Megiddo" (Meggido is found within the valley of Jezreel. Meggido means to slaughter or cut off.) and some believe it may be the scene of the battle of Armageddon, according to a passage in Revelation that says "they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon" (Revelation 16:16-21). The word Armageddon is a combination of the word har, meaning mountain or mountain range, and mgiddown, which in English is "Megiddo."

Neno "Yezreel"nimuunganiko wa maneneo mawili ya kiebrani humaanisha "kupanda" na "uwezo" au "Mwenye nguvu zote na katika muunganiko humaanisha Mungu atapanda."Yezreel ni jina ambalo Hosea alimpa mwanaye mkubwa katika 1:4 ambalo lilikuwa ni la kinabii.Aliwakilisha uzao wa haki ambawo ungepandwa katika Israel. The word "Jezreel" is constructed of two Hebrew words meaning "to sow" and "mighty" or "Almighty" and in combination the meaning is "God will sow." Jezreel is the name Hosea gave to his oldest son in 1:4 which was prophetic. He represented the righteous seed that was and would be sown in Israel.

-Sentensi katika sehemu ya mwisho ya msitari huu ni za mkato sana,na zinajieleza kwa kuendelea;zikiacha yale maneno yaliyotumiwa na Watafasiri:nitasema kwa watu ambao HAWAKUWA WATU WANGU,NINYI NI WATU WANGU na wao watasema, U MUNGU WETU. The sentences in the latter part of this verse are very abrupt, but exceedingly expressive; leaving out those words supplied by the translators: I will say to NOT MY PEOPLE, THOU MY PEOPLE; and they shall say, MY GOD.

> 1 Peter 2:9,10 Bali ninyi ni mzao mteule, ukuhani wa kifalme, taifa takatifu, watu wa milki ya Mungu, mpate kuzitangaza fadhili zake yeye aliyewaita mtoke gizani mkaingie katika nuru yake ya ajabu;
 10 ninyi mliokuwa kwanza si taifa, bali sasa ni taifa la Mungu; mliokuwa hamkupata rehema, bali sasa mmepata rehema.
1 Peter 2:9,10 &mdash; But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

### MstrVerse 26

Hapa tunaona watu wa mataifa.Neema ya kwanza ya Mungu imewapata wale ambao mara ya kwanza waliitwa "mbwa"(Mat  15:26)na kuwapa wao wito "waliitwa kuwa wana Mungu aliye hai." Here we see the Gentile people. God's infinite grace takes up those who were once called "dogs" (Matthew 15:26) and gives them a heavenly calling "Called to be children of the living God."

> Hosea 1:10-11,10Tena itakuwa ya kwamba hesabu ya wana wa Israeli itafanana na mchanga wa bahari, usioweza kupimwa wala kuhesabiwa; tena itakuwa, badala ya kuambiwa, Ninyi si watu wangu, wataambiwa, Ninyi ndio wana wa Mungu aliye hai.
 11 Na wana wa Yuda na wana wa Israeli watakusanyika pamoja, nao watajiwekea kichwa kimoja, nao watakwea watoke katika nchi hii; kwa maana siku ya Yezreeli itakuwa kuu sana.
&mdash;Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. 11 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

### MstrVerse 27

MstrVerse 27:	Hapa mtume ananukuu na nabii mwingine,Isa. 10:22 -kuhusiana na mabaki- Here the apostle quotes another prophet, Isaiah. Isa. 10:22 - concerning a remnant.

> Isa 10:22 Maana watu wako, Ee Israeli, wajapokuwa wengi kama mchanga wa pwani, ni mabaki tu watakaorudi; kuangamiza kumekusudiwa, kunakofurika kwa haki.
 Isaiah 10:22 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.

"mabaki"kutoka"2641;abakiye n.k.(kwa matumizi)mabaki wachacheremnant" from 2641; a remainder, i.e. (by implication) a few:--remnant.

### mst28Verse 28

Njia za Mungu sio zetu.Yeye husubiri-na huchukuliana-na yeye ni mkimya-kisha kwa ghafula huweka kusudi lililo kusudiwa la milele.The ways of God are not our ways. He waits long - He forbears - He is silent: then suddenly puts into execution an eternally formed purpose.

"mkato katika hakiCut short in righteousness."

> Ezekiel 20:35,36nami nitawaingiza katika jangwa la mataifa, na huko ndiko nitakakoteta nanyi uso kwa uso.
 36 Kama nilivyoteta na baba zenu katika jangwa la Misri, ndivyo nitakavyoteta nanyi, asema Bwana MUNGU. Ezekiel 20:35&mdash;And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face. 36 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

- kukata kwa ufupi neno hili humaanisha "kufanya kwa spidi."Maangamizi hayatakawia.(Waebr 4:12) "kata"Cut it short - This word here means to "execute it speedily." The destruction shall not be delayed. (Hebrews 4:12 "cut")
