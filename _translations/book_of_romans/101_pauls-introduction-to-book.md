Paulo atoa wasifu wake:Paul gives his credentials:

#### Paulo Paul

Paulo, Sauli alizaliwa  Tariso mnamo AD 1.Sauli ni jina la kiebrania lenye kumaanisha aliyehitajiwa,aliyeombwa kwa ajili ya.Paulo ni jina la kilatini lenye kumaanisha, mdogo,kidogo.Kubadilishwa kwa jina la Sauli kwenda jina la Paulo haikuelezewa katika maandiko matakatifu lakini kirahisi ni jambo lililoelezewa katika Matendo 13:9.Kuna uhusiano usio kanushika kati ya jina la kimataifa la Paulo na huduma yake yenye nguvu ya kimataifa.(1 Tm2:7)mji wa nyumbani wa Sauli Tarso ulikuwa kituo cha kujifunzia cha watu ulimwengu wa kale kama vile miji ya Athene na Alekzandirea,lakini Paulo alikuwa amefunzwa katika Yerusalemu chini ya malezi ya  mwalimu mkuu Gamaliel,mfarisayo na mwanachama wa Sanhedrin. (matendo 22:3)Gamaliel alikuwa mtalaamu wa sheria.(matendo 5:34) Ilikuwa chini ya huu usitadi wa wa rabi mkuu, ambayo Paulo alikuwa amejazwa na wivu mkuu kwa ajili ya sheria ya kiyahudi iliopelekea kwake kuwatesa wakristo.Sauli mwishowe akawa mwanachama wa Sanhedrin na vilevile alikuwa Mfarisayo.Mafunzo ya Sauli yalimfanya kuwa bingwa juu ya sheria za kiyahudi.Yeye alikuwa ameandaliwa vizuri kujibu baadaye katika huduma yake yakikristo juu ya mashitaka au swali la wayahudi. Paul was born Saul about 1 AD in Tarsus. Saul is a Hebrew name meaning &quot;demanded; prayed for.&quot; Paul is a Latin name meaning &quot;small; little.&quot; The changing of Saul&apos;s name to Paul is not explained in the Scripture but is simply and matter-of-factly stated in Acts 13:9. There is an undeniable connection between Paul&apos;s Gentile name and his strongly Gentile ministry. (I Timothy 2:7)
Saul&apos;s hometown of Tarsus was a great center of learning in the ancient world likened to the cities of Athens and Alexandria, but Saul was raised in Jerusalem under the tutelage of the great teacher Gamaliel, a Pharisee and a member of the Sanhedrin. (Acts 22:3) Gamaliel was a doctor of the Jewish law. (Acts 5:34) It was under the mastery of this great rabbi that Paul was infused with a great zeal for Jewish Law which led to his persecution of Christians. Saul eventually became a member of the Sanhedrin and was also a Pharisee. Saul&apos;s training also made him an expert on Jewish Law. He was well-equipped to answer later on his Christian ministry any accusation or question of the Jews.
Tariso ulikuwa ni mji uliopendwa na utawala wa Warumi.Raia wa kiyahudi wangeweza kupokea uraia wa kirumi.Sauli wa tariso alikuwa raia wa kirumi.Marupurupu ya uraia wa kirumi ni pamoja na haki ya kupiga kura,haki ya kuwa na jaribio la kisheria,haki ya kudai maamuzi katika mahakama ndogo kwenye viwango vya juu ya mahakama ya juu katika maswala ya uhaini mkubwa uliodaiwa haki ya kujaribiwa katika Rumi.Raia wa kirumi angeteswa,kupigwa,au kuhukumiwa kifo isipokuwa amehisika na uhaini.Katika Matendo 22,urai wa Paulo wa kirumi ulishinda kifo na mapigo.Tarsus was particularly favored by the Roman Empire. Jewish citizens of Tarsus could receive Roman citizenship. Saul of Tarsus was a Roman citizen. The privileges of Roman citizenship included the right to vote, the right to have a legal trial, the right to appeal lower court decision at the higher court levels and in cases of alleged treason the right to be tried in Rome. A Roman citizen could not be tortured, whipped or condemned to death unless convicted of treason. In Acts 22, Paul&apos;s Roman citizenship prevented his death and even a scourging.

#### Mtumishi wa Yesu Kristo. A Servant of Jesus Christ

Paulo,raia huru wa kirumi achagua kujitambulisha mwenyewe kama mtumwa wa Yesu kristo.Mtumishi mfungwa ni mfungwa aliyefungwa kwa ajili ya mwingine kwa heshima afungwa kwa ajili ya maisha.Biblia ya kiwango cha kawaida ya kiamerika toka kigriki i ikijumisha yafuatayo katika ufafanuzi wake kwa mtumishi aliyefungwa,kama aliyejitoa kwa ajili ya upendo wa mwingine. Paul, a free-born Roman citizen chooses to identify himself as a doulos or &quot;bond-servant&quot; of Jesus Christ. A &quot;bond-servant&quot; is one bound to another by honorable ties for life. The New American Standard Bible Greek Lexicon includes the following statement in its definition of &quot;doulos&quot;: &quot;devoted to another to the disregard of one's own interests.&quot;
Waandishi wa agano jipya hutumia jina la mtumishi,mara kwa mara walitumia kama jina ambalo wao waolitazamia kujulikana.Kristo aliwaamuru wanafunzi wake katika Mark 10:44,kila mtu aliye mkuu kwenu atakuwa mtuwa wawote.Maandisha ya Paulo kwa Warumi yalikuwa na mamlaka sio kwasababu ya utambulisho wake lakini ni kwasababu ya Bwana wake ambaye yeye alikuwa balozi wake.Paulo alifanya tamko lijulikane juu ya ubwana wa Kristo na baraka ya uwakilishi wa huduma ya muumini kwake.moyo wa Paulo na roho viligonga kwenye tangazo la Yohana mbatizaji na dunia ilikuwa imejitenga kutoka wanatheolojia na waalimu wa kiungu;ambao hupambana kwa ajili  ya wakuu.Yohana mbatizaji alitangaza akisema juu ya Kristo katika Yohana 3:30,yeye lazima aongezeke,nami niweze kupungua.Moyo wa mtumishi wa kweli humtumkuza bwana wake na sio kwa ajili yake wenyewe.The writers of the New Testament used the title &quot;servant&quot; often as a name by which they expected to be known. Christ commanded His disciples in Mark 10:44, &quot;And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.&quot; Paul&apos;s writing of Romans was with great authority not because of his credentials, but because of His Master Whose ambassador he was. Paul made his plea known based on Christ&apos;s Lordship and the blessing of the Believer&apos;s voluntary service to Him. Paul&apos;s heart and spirit rang in trueness with John the Baptist&apos;s declaration and was a world apart from the theologians and &quot;Doctors of Divinity&quot; who strive for masteries. John the Baptist declared speaking of Christ in John 3:30, &quot;He must increase, but I must decrease.&quot; The heart of a true servant exalts its Lord and not itself.
Mwalimu aliuliza,je unaweza kusemaje ikiwa una mtumishi mwenye mtazamo hasi?Baadaye ukaitikia kama mtu ambaye alikuwa anajibu.Kama mtumishi wa bwana,lazima uwe na hiari ya kuchukua yote ambayo bwana alikuwa anachukua(Yohn 15:18; 17:14).Wakati mwingine lazima tuoshe madirisha,au hata miguu ya mtu fulani.Kristo anataka zaidi ya maneno (Yohn 13:5-17).Ikiwa unataka kuwa mkuu katika ufalme lazima ujifunze kuwa mtumwa wawote!Paulo ni mtumwa kwa Mwokozi;(Na sio mfalme).Hutuambia zaidi katika sura ya 12. A teacher asked, &quot;How can you tell if you have a servant attitude?&quot; &quot;By the way you react when you are treated like one,&quot; was the reply. As a servant of the master, you must be willing to take all that the Master has taken (John 15:18; 17:14). Sometimes we might have to wash windows, or even someone&apos;s feet. Christ wants more than just words (John 13:5-17). If you want to be great in the Kingdom, learn to be the servant of all!
Paul is a slave to the &quot;savior&quot; (not the &quot;king&quot;). He tells us more in chapter 12.

#### Aliitwa kuwa mtumeCalled to be an Apostle

mtume ni mtu ALIYETUMWA KWENDA kama mjumbe au mwakilishi wa mamlaka halisi ya mtumaji;mjumbe au balozi.(Mdo 9:3-9, 15-22, 28)wito wa kitume wa Paulo haukuwa wa kidunia.Wala hakuwa mgombea kwa wale waliopigiwa kura katika Mdo 1 bali wito wakitume wa Paulo ni kwenda mbele kama mtume aliyekuja toka kwa Kristo.(1:5) Paulo anasisitiza kuwa yeye alikuwa ameitwa kuwa mtume;na wito huu ulikuwa wa kimungu na sio wa kibinadamu. An apostle is one who has been SENT FORTH as a messenger or representative of and fully authorized by the sender&mdash;a delegate or ambassador. (Acts 9:3-9, 15-22, 28) Paul&apos;s calling was not earthly. He was not even a candidate in the vote taken in Acts 1, but Paul&apos;s calling and sending forth as an apostle came from Christ. (1:5) Paul emphasizes that he was called to be an Apostle; this calling was by God and not by man.

> Wagal 1:1 Paulo, mtume, (si mtume wa wanadamu, wala kutumwa na mwanadamu, bali na Yesu Kristo, na Mungu Baba aliyemfufua kutoka kwa wafu),
Galatians 1:1&mdash;Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)

#### Aliyetengwa kwa ajili ya injili ya MunguSeparated Unto the Gospel of God

##### Aliyetengwa;utaratibu wa utume wa paulo umetolewa katika Mdo 13:1-4.

&quot;Separated&quot; &mdash; Paul&apos;s ordination is given in Acts 13:1-4.

##### Juu ya injili ya Mungu;&quot;Unto the Gospel of God&quot;

Paulo alikuwa mhubiri wa injili yeye alikuwa mjumbe aliye tengwa mwenye ujumbe maalumu.Injili ni siri(Mark 4:11; I Tim. 3:9,16; Wakol. 2:2; 4:3; Waef. 1:9) ufunuo wa kimungu.(Mdo 9).and a Divine revelation. (Acts 9).
Paul was a &quot;preacher of the Gospel&quot;. He was a separated messenger with a special Message. The Gospel is a mystery (Mark 4:11; I Tim. 3:9,16; Col. 2:2; 4:3; Eph. 1:9) and a Divine revelation. (Acts 9).

Uwekwaji wakifu kamili umezungumzwa katika maneno haya.Paulo alitengwa kuhubiri ujumbe moja na wa pekee.Paulo hakutangaza kwamba ujumbe huo ungemtukuza yeye wala hakufanya zaidi ya nafasi yake mbele ya macho ya watu.Paulo alitangaza kwamba kusudi lake katika maisha llilikuwa ni Injili ya Mungu,na kwahiyo hili lingepaswa kuwa kusudi letu kama wa hudumu Injili.Absolute consecration is spoken of in these words. Paul was set apart to preach one message and only one message. Paul did not declare a message that exalted himself nor did he do a work to further his position in the eyes of men. Paul declares that his purpose in life was the Gospel of God, and so should this be our purpose as ministers of the Gospel.

### Ujumbe wake,mstr. 1-5 His Message, vs. 1-5

Ujumbe wa Paulo ni injili.injili haikutokana na Paulo injili yote inamhusu Yesu Kristo:Bwana wetu,uzao wa daudi ,mwana wa Mungu,aliyefufuka.Paul&apos;s message is the Gospel. The Gospel does not originate from Paul and is wholly concerned with Jesus Christ: our Lord, seed of David, Son of God, resurrected.

#### Ilihubiriwa na mitume wake mstr 1,5Preached by His Apostles 	vs. 1,5
#### Iliahidiwa na manabii wake mstr. 2 (Isa. 53:11; Yer. 23:6; 33:16)Promised &quot;by his prophets&quot; vs. 2 (Isa. 53:11; Jer. 23:6; 33:16)
#### Iliotokana na uzao wa Daudi mstr.3Made of the Seed of David			vs. 3

Revealed through the Holy Ghost vs. 4

KUMBUKA:Injili haikubakia kwenye uwepo wa mwili,bali katika ufufuo wa Kristo.NOTE: The Gospel does not rest on the incarnation, but on the resurrection of Christ.

### Wasomaji wake, mstr,6-7His Readers, vs.6-7



#### Walioitwa na Yesu Kristo:The called of Jesus Christ:

Wale waliounganishwa na Yesu wameungwa pamoja naye katika wito wake.Walioitwa ambao Paulo anaandika haimanishi waalikwa,bali humaanisha wale walioalikwa ambao wamekuja tayari.Those connected to Jesus are connected with Him by His calling. The Called that Paul is writing to does not simply mean those invited, but means those invited that have come.

#### Wote walioko Rumi,All that be in Rome,

##### haina shaka kwamba waandikiwa wa waraka huu walikuwa ni wakristo Warumi.It is unquestionable that the recipients of this epistle were the Roman Christians.

War1:7 kwa wote walioko Rumi, wapendwao na Mungu, walioitwa kuwa watakatifu. Romans 1:7&mdash;To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints&ellip;
War 1:15 Kwa hiyo, kwa upande wangu, mimi ni tayari kuihubiri Injili hata na kwenu ninyi mnaokaa Rumi.
Romans 1:15&mdash;&ellip;I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

##### Wakristo wa Rumi waliathiriwa na wamataifa. The Christians at Rome were Predominately Gentile.

Andiko linaonyesha kwa kanisa la kirumi lililo athiriwa na wamataifa kama Paulo anavyolielezea kanisa akiliacha kwa ugumu na shaka ambayo anawaaandikia wa mataifa.Scripture seems to point to a predominantly Gentile Roman church as Paul&apos;s manner of addressing the church leaves hardly any doubt that he is writing to Gentiles.

Katika sura ya kwanza,anazugumza habari ya utume kwa ajili ya utii wa imani kati ya mataifa(1:5). Hurejea kwa waandikiwa kama wamataifa mengine"na kutoa kama sababu yake kuwa tayari kuhubiri injili kwao kana kwamba yeye anadaiwa kwa Wagriki na kwa wayunani(1:14),  Kwa maana siionei haya Injili; kwa sababu ni uweza wa Mungu uuletao wokovu, kwa kila aaminiye, kwa Myahudi kwanza, na kwa Myunani pia.(1:16).
In chapter one, Paul speaks of his apostleship for obedience of the faith among all the nations (1:5). He refers to the recipients as "other gentiles" and also gives as his reason for being ready to preach the Gospel to them as that he is debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians (1:14), and that the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation, though to the Jew first, yet to the Greek also (1:16).

> 1:13 ili nipate kuwa na matunda kwenu ninyi pia kama nilivyo nayo katika Mataifa wengine.
1:13 &mdash;I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

Wakati nafasi na matumaini ya taifa la kiyahudi yako chini ya uangalizi na Paulo anakuja kuwaasa,hii ni kwa waumini wa mataifa ambao anaelezea.When the position and prospects of the Jewish nation are under review and Paul comes to admonition, it is to the Gentile believers that he addresses it.

> 11:13 Lakini nasema na ninyi, mlio watu wa Mataifa. Basi, kwa kadiri nilivyo mtume wa watu wa Mataifa, naitukuza huduma iliyo yangu,
11:13&mdash;For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
> 15:15-16Lakini nawaandikia, kwa ujasiri zaidi katika sehemu za waraka huu, kana kwamba kuwakumbusha, kwa neema ile niliyopewa na Mungu,
ili niwe mhudumu wa Kristo Yesu kati ya watu wa Mataifa, niifanyie Injili ya Mungu kazi ya ukuhani, kusudi Mataifa wawe sadaka yenye kibali, ikiisha kutakaswa na Roho Mtakatifu.
15:15-16&mdash; Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God, 16 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

#### Wapendwa wa Mungu, Beloved of God,

Wenye dhambi wanapaswa kuamini kwamba Mungu anawapenda;bali,watakatifu wanapaswa kujua kwamba Mungu anawapenda;wasiokoka kamwe hawawezi kuitwa wapendwa wa Mungu;Sinners should believe that God loves them; but , saints should know they are the &quot;beloved of God&quot;. The unsaved are never called &quot;God&apos;s Beloved.&quot;

#### Kuitwa kuwa mtakatifu:Called to be saints:

Familia ya Mungu hujumuisha watakatifu walioitwa kwa neema ya Mungu kutoka duniani kuwa watu wake.(1Wakr 1:2)watakatifu waliotengwa kwa ajili ya ibada na sifa.The family of God comprises of saints called out of the world by God&apos;s grace to be His own people. (I Cor. 1:2) Saints are those who are set apart for worship and praise.

Ufunguo mwingine wa kufahamu maana ya neno watakatifu;ni waliotakaswa,watakatifu moja kwa moja wako kinyume cha dhambi.Watakatifu ni wale ambao hurusu utakatifu kuwa uhalisia wa maisha yao.Haki ya kweli ni tukio la mapenzi.haki ya kweli sikuzote huzalisha tendo la inje na matokeo ya ndani.Kila muundo wa dhambi lazima uwekwe inje ya moyo.Kama mawakili wa maadili lazima akili zetu zisikubaliane na dhambi.Kwa tendo la mapenzi,watakatifu hukataa dhambi zote;kwa miujiza ya neema ya Mungu,watakatifu hushinda dhambi zote.Another word key to understanding the meaning of &quot;saints&quot; is &quot;sanctified.&quot;Saints are directly opposed to sin. Saints are those who allow holiness to become a reality in their lives. True righteousness is a phenomenon of the will. True righteousness always produces outward action and inward results. Every form of sin must be put out of the heart. As moral agents our intellect must disapprove of sin. By an act of the will, saints renounce ALL sin; by the miracle of God&apos;s grace, saints overcome ALL sin.

ANGALIA MANENO YA MLALO KATIKA KIFNUGU HIKI.Neno la kigiriki limetafasiriwa;walioitwa ,lenye kufasiri kwa kumaanisha;walioalikwa;vilevile ingetumika kuelezea;waliofanywa,walioratibiwa;kwa halisi tungerejealea neno hili watakatifu kama,waliofanywa watakatifu.Notice the italics in this clause. The Greek word translated &quot;called&quot; is interpreted to mean &quot;invited&quot; but it also could be used to express &quot;made, constituted.&quot; We could properly render this clause &quot;made saints.&quot;

#### Neema kwenu na amani zitoka kwa Mungu Baba yetu,na bwana wetu Yesu kristo.Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Hii ni salamu ya kawaida kwa Paulo katika nyaraka zake.Jina Yesu Kristo au Bwana au Bwana Yesu Kristo limetajwa mara kumi katika Warumi.Yesu ni jina binafsi kama mwokozi.Matt 1:21.Kristo ni mpakwa mafuta wa Mungu;Bwana anadokeza kusema kuwa yeye ni Bwana wa vyote vya mbinguni na duniani(Mdo 10:36).Yesu kristo ni bwana wetu wa kila hali! This is a common greeting of Paul in his epistles. The title &quot;Jesus Christ our Lord&quot; or &quot;Lord Jesus Christ&quot; is used ten times in Romans. Jesus is the personal name as Savior. Matt. 1:21. Christ is &quot;God&apos;s anointed one&quot; Lord denotes He is Lord of all things in heaven and earth (Acts 10:36). Jesus Christ our Lord is the Master of every situation!

## Utayari wa Paulo(kutembelea,kupasha&kuhubiri)1:8-15Paul&apos;s Readiness (to Visit, Impart & Preach)	 1:8-15

Mistr ya 8-15 inaelezea hisia binafisi za Paulo kwa ajili ya watakatifu wa Rumi.Verses 8-15 express Paul&apos;s personal feelings for the Roman saints.

### Paulo anatoa shukurani kwa ajili imani ya watakatifu wa Rumi na kuwaombea.mstr 8,9Paul is thankful for the faith of the Roman saints and so prays for them. Vs. 8,9

Dunia yote ni rejea kwa umiliki wa utawala wa kirumi ambao siku zote hujirelea kama dunia yote.Ilikuwa ni Augustino alitoa amri wakati wa kuzaliwa Kristo ambao dunia yote ingetoa ushuru,ambayo ilikuwa ni rejea ya utawala wa Kirumi.The whole world is in reference to the domain of the Roman Empire which often referred to itself as the whole world. It was Augustus who made the decree at the birth of Christ that the whole world should be taxed, which was in reference to the dominions of Rome.

Imani ya watakatifu wa Rumi katika utawala wote.Hawa wakridto wa kirumi walikuwa ni "wapendwa wa Mungu","walioitwa kuwa watakatifu",wapokeaji wa neema na amani kutoka kwa Mungu Baba yetu,na Bwana Yesu Kristo.Ushuhuda wao ulitoka kwamba walikuwa wametengwa kwa ajili ya Mungu na kumwakilishi mfalme wa utukufu.hazina nzuri ya ushuhuda ni Paulo anasimama juu ya uwanja vita katika maombi ambaye imani yao na ushuhuda wao ungeendelea.The faith of the saints in Rome was spoken of throughout the entire Empire. These Roman Christians are the "Beloved of God", "Called to be saints", and recipients of the grace and peace "from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Their testimony bears out that they are separated unto God and represent the King of Glory. What a treasure a good testimony is! Paul stands on the battleground in prayer that their faith and testimony would continue.

### Yeye amekuwa na shauku ya kutembelea watakatifu wa Rumi na kuwatakia karama za roho kwa kusudi lake kuliona kanisa likiwa limethibitika.mstr 10,11,12He has a great desire to visit the Roman saints and impart spiritual gifts unto them because of his motive to see the church established. Vs. 10,11,12

Roma ilikuwa ni mkakatiRome was strategic, but Paul is led by the Spirit and not statistics. It is probable that Paul realized the strategic value of building up the church in the capital city of the Roman Empire, but Paul was a caliber of minister that would invest as heavily in a city no one ever heard of. He was blessed to hear that there were saints in Rome and desired to visit them to do his part to strengthen the church there. 

It is logical that a Revival in the city of Rome would have impact on the entire Empire, but the truth is, anywhere God manifests is power could potentially turn the world on his head.

> Acts 17:6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;

Paul did not push others down to exalt himself a little higher, but he sought and worked for there to be MUTUAL faith, equal experience, in and with God. Paul knew that God had called him that others would follow in the same path of faith as their testimony grew. (Rom.1:6; I Cor. 3:21-23)

<!-- Step #20-->

### Paul had been hindered from going to Rome. Vs. 13,14,15

Was "let hitherto"in v.13 means *to hinder* or *to prevent*. He had wanted to and even planned to go, but he had been hindered.

Paul would one day go to Rome as a prisoner to stand before the Roman leaders and proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the Jews and the Gentiles. The book of Acts tells us that Paul dwelt two years in Rome; it is believed that he was under house arrest during this time of being in Rome. He would again return to Rome as a prisoner in AD 67 where he was beheaded under the persecution of Nero.

Paul had great desire to preach the Gospel in Rome. He uses the word debtor in reference to himself to show that he is committed to preach to all men.- V. 14 (&quot;opheiletes&quot; obliged - transgress against God if he did not go.) He was a debtor to the sinner to tell him about Christ. To preach to all classes &mdash; Greeks; Barbarians&hellip;

&quot;Greeks&quot; is used to refer to the wise Gentiles who have been educated in Greek culture and philosophy.

&quot;Barbarians&quot; is used to refer to those outside of the Greek 	culture, that would not have been educated. It was usually applied to foreigners, who Paul also describes as being unwise referring to their lack of education. This phrase then has reference to the entire Gentile world.

It matters not Greek, Jew, Barbarian, wise, or unwise, Paul, is ready to preach to them. Paul was indebted to Greek and Jew, there was no difference because the Gospel makes no difference, but is for both the Greek and Jew.

[SEE: http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/jew.htm (origin of the name JEW)]

Paul proclaimed as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.-V. 15 This means he was ready to go and preach with all that was within him; well knowing that he would face opposition to the Gospel message.

Paul demonstrated the spirit of a True Prophet &mdash;Ambassador &mdash; Oracle-Messenger of God: &quot;I am ready to preach the gospel to you.&quot; We see Paul has a genuine pastor&apos;s heart, as well. (1:11-17; 9:1-3; 15:23-24)

NOTE: "ready <prothumos>" means 'forward in spirit, predisposed; ready, willing.' Matthew 26:41; Mark 14:38
