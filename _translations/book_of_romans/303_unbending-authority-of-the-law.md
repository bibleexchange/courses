## Mamlaka yasiyopindika ya sheria(mst.9-19)The Unbending Authority of the Law (vs. 9-19)

> *Kuhesabiwa haki ni kwa imani pasipo matendo ya sheria.Sheria ni:faida kwa wale ambao wanaijua(mst20-30),haijafanywa kama kitu cha kuepuka bali inathibitishwa kwa imani yetu.(ms.31)*Justification is by faith without the deeds of the Law. The Law is: an advantage to those who know it (vs. 1-2), absolute in its nature (vs. 3-8), unbending in its authority (vs. 9-19), has a distinct purpose (vs. 20-30), and is not made void, but rather is established	by our faith. (v. 31).*

Dunia yote iko chini ya hukumu.The whole world is under the sentence of condemnation.

## Shitaka limetozwa dhidi ya mwenye dhambi.mst.9The charge is levied against the sinner. &mdash; v. 9

Mwenye dhambi ni nani?tumeshathibitisha kuwa wote wayahudi na wamataifa wako chini ya dhambi kwahivyo wote wanahatia ya kuvunja sheria.Who is a sinner? We have proven both Jew and Gentile to be under sin as ALL are guilty of breaking the law.

## Ushahidi hutolewa mbele ya mshitakiwa.Witnesses are brought before the accused.

### Ushahidi wa uumbaji;1:20The witness of creation &mdash; 1:20
### Ushahidi wa dhamira;2:15The witness of conscience &mdash; 2:15
### Ushahidi wa amri;3:19The witness of commandment &mdash; 3:19
 
## Shitaka lililo somwa toka Maandiko.mst 10-18The indictment is read from the Scriptures. &mdash; vs. 10-18

### Kulingana na sheria za kimahakama shitaka rasimi lazima liwe limeandikwa.According to the rules of the court the indictment had to be written.

> Shitaka rasmi ni shitaka lililoandikwa au shitaka la kawaida la mhalifu au mkosaji,hurejelewa kama baraza la wazee wa mahakama chini ya kiapo cha mahakama.-WebsterAn indictment is a written accusation or formal charge of a crime or misdemeanor, preferred by a grand jury under oath to a court. - Webster

Hakimu mkuu haachi udhuru kwa ajili binadamu na Paulo ametumia neno lililoandikwa kuonyesha mshitakiwa.The Great Judge leaves no excuse for humanity and has Paul use the written Word to indict the accused.

### Paul used their own sacred text to condemn the Jews.
	
The Jew boasted that he possessed the Scripture; now God is using that same Word to expose their sin. God is making them accountable to His Word.

### Ingawa wamataifa hawakuwa na neno lilioandikwa ;lakini bado wanakanuni ileile ikiwa pamoja na nenpo lililoandikwa katika mioyo yaoAlthough the Gentile did not have the written word; they still had the same principals contained in the Word written on their heart 

## Ulinzi wa mshitakiwa;ms.19The defense of the accused &mdash; V. 19

Ulinzi wa mshitakiwa ni nini?What is the defense of the accused?

Mshitakiwa hana la kusema;kila kinywa kimefungwa.The accused has nothing to say; every mouth is stopped.
Siku ya hukumu itakuwa ni siku ya kunyamaza kimya.The Day of Judgment will be a day of silence.

## Uamuzi; mstr.20The verdict &mdash; V.20

### HATIA KAMA ILIVYO SHITAKIWA!GUILTY AS CHARGED!

### Hakuna mwenye mweili atakaye hesabiwa haki kwa matendo sheria.No flesh is justified by deeds of law.
	
Sheria inarejea zaidi ya sheria ya Musa;vilevile pia kwenye sheria ya maadili na sheria ya dhamiri.Watu wamataifa hawakuimiliki sheria ya Musa,lakini kila mtu anasheria ya maadili ya Mungu ilioandikwa katika moyo wake na kuthibitishwa na dhamiri yake.This law refers to more than Moses Law; there is also reference to moral law and the law of conscience. The Gentile did not posses Moses&apos;s Law, but every man has the moral law of God written on his heart and testified to by his conscience.

### Malipo ya kifo yameshatolewa dhidi ya mhukumiwa.War.6:23The death penalty has been levied against the condemned. Rom.6:23
