18###				INTRODUCTION	
19###				This is the Old Testament Bookshelf.	
20###				The word "testament" means "will" or "covenant." The term "Old Testament", therefore, refers to God's covenant or promise-law to bless mankind through the Jewish nation. It has also come to refer to the writings about the Old Covenant, although, strictly speaking,these ancient books are the Old Covenant Scriptures.
21###				The Scriptures of the Old Testament record the story of God"s chosen people, Israel, and their relationship to His covenant to bless all nations through them.

66###				The Books of Law	
67###				The are Two Titles of the Books of the Law	
68###				The five books of the Law (Jewish name: Torah) are also called "the Pentateuch"(a Greek name) which means "five scrolls." At least some of this literature if not all was written by Moses (Luke 24:27; John 5:46). These books describe the creation of the world, God"s call to the Hebrews to be His special people,their captivity and release from Egypt, the laws which guided them on their way to the Promised Land and how God blessed the people when they obeyed and disciplined them when they disobeyed.	
69###				These are the Order of Events in the Pentateuch

90###				See the Whole Picture of the Bible	
91###				A superficial reading of the Bible shows it to be a collection of sixty-six books written during a period of about 1600 years by about forty different authors, among who were kings, prophets, priests, a shepherd, and fishermen. It appears to be alibrary rather than one book. A closer look at the Bible reveals it to be aunified work.	
92###				Through the many stories and varied subject matter of the Scriptures runs one outstanding and predominant theme--theRedemption of mankind through a Divinely appointed Savior (and this isevidence to the fact that all the authors were under the direction of oneAuthor--The Holy Ghost.) This unity of the Scriptures is a stark contrastcompared to the Islamic Koran, which consists of a collection of 114 unrelatedchapters organized according to their length (with the exception of Sura i.).	
93###				The story of Redemption is a dramatic story, and not dead, boring, hastily combined pieces of literature. uThePentateuch sets the scene and palette for the entire picture of Biblicalrevelation.	
94###				(Gen. 3:15; 6:18; Ex.12:13; Lev. 1:5; Num. 19:1-10; Deut. 1:8; uLuke 24:27)	
95###				General Details of the Pentateuch	
96###				Pentateuch means "5 Scrolls" and is the Greek name given to the first five books of the Bible by the translators. These 5 books are known by the Jews as "The Torah" which means TheLaw. The Pentateuch is part of the Old Testament. "Testament" means will or covenant. This covenant was one of shadows and promises of better things to come. (Hebrews 8:6-13)	
97###				Hebrews 12:24--And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.	
98###				At least some of the Pentateuch if not all was written by Moses and the Pentateuch is without question Divinely inspired Scripture. The Pentateuch"s authenticity<a href='#endNotes' >[1]</a> is attested by the most indisputable evidence, and it is cited as an inspired record thirty-three times in the course of the Scriptures. <a href='#endNotes' >[2]</a>	
99###				A Description of each book of the Pentateuch	
100###				GENESIS is the book of origins--of the beginning of life, and of ruin through sin. Its first phrase "inthe beginning God created" is in striking contrast to its last phrase "in a coffin in Egypt."	
101###				EXODUS is the book of Redemption--the first need of a ruined race.	
102###				LEVITICUS is the book of worship and communion, which is the proper exercise of the redeemed.	
103###				NUMBERS speaks of the experiences of a pilgrim people passing through a hostile scene to a promised inheritance.	
104###				DEUTERONOMY is retrospective and prospective. It is a book of instruction for the redeemed about to enter into their inheritance. (Retrospective – relating to things of the past. Prospective – relating to things of the future.) "Remember"is the key word.	
105###				Authorship of the Pentateuch	
106###				The author of the Pentateuch is nowhere designated in the collection itself. The testimony of the Bible,however, is that Moses was the author of the majority of the Pentateuch.	
107###				Passages Confirming this Conclusion 	
108###				Ex. 17:14 Moses, Write this…in a book	
109###				John 1:45 Moses…did write	
110###				John 5:46 Moses…he wrote of Me 	
111###				Mark 12:26; 2 Chr. 25:4; Neh. 13:1 book of Moses	
112###				EXCEPTION: Deuteronomy 34 almost definitely was not written by Moses.	
113###				(REASONING: Concerns his death and what took place following his death.)<a href='#endNotes' >[3]</a>	
114###				Depth of the Pentateuch	
115###				The Pentateuch is not merely a record of happenings, but in thePentateuch we have a true and logical introduction to the entire Bible, and an epitome<a href='#endNotes' >[4]</a>of the Divine revelation. The Pentateuch introduces in their embryonic stage such doctrines as:	
116###				The Nature of God God is the Source of all Things (Gen. 1:1)	
117###				The Nature of Man Man is Sinful (Gen.3:6; 4:8)	
118###				The Nature of Satan Satan is a Liar (Gen.3:4)	
119###				The Nature of Sin  Sin brings Death (Gen.2:17)	
120###				The Nature of Salvation Salvation through theCross (Num. 21:4-9)	
121###				Historical Precedence	
122###				Babylonian and Assyrian monuments contain records bearing a grotesque resemblance to the majestic account ofCreation and of The Flood. Dennis Bratcher of CRI has observed, "…there aresimply too many similarities between the accounts to deny any relationship between the accounts." This fact confirms rather than invalidates Divine inspiration of the Mosaic account. Some tradition of creation and the Flood would inevitably be handed down in the ancient cradle of the human race. Suchtradition, following the order of all tradition, would take on grotesque and mythological features over time, and these abound in the Babylonianrecords.	
123###				An example of such a tradition that has survived the ages is the uEnuma Elish ("When on High"). The uEnumaElish is seven Babylonian clay tablets uncovered in Nineveh (Mosul, Iraq)by Henry Layard in 1849. The uEnuma Elish has about a thousand lines and is recorded in Old Babylonian on seven clay tablets, each holding between 115and 170 lines of text. The tablets give us a good look at the Babylonian world view centered on their patron false god, Marduk. These tablets date back to 7th or 8th century BC but the story contained in it may date as far back as the 12th or even the 14th century BC.

127###				God is seen as the ultimate source of power;  transcends creation	
128###				Magic incantations are ultimate source of power; the  gods are subject to nature. III. 101; IV. 1-26,91<a href='#endNotes' >[6]</a>	
129###				Organized synopsis of creation; systematically  includes general realms of nature.	
130###				Does not include creation of vegetation, animals or  light –the existence of these is assumed. Moon and stars created but not sun.  V.2-22	
131###				PURPOSE: Praise to God as Lord of Creation;  acknowledging Him as such. A tribute to God"s sovereignty.	
132###				PURPOSE: Hymn of praise to Marduk as champion and  mightiest of the gods. Creation is incidental. VI. 100ff	
133###				Begins before things as we know them existed. As God  created, He gave names.

138###				No chronological structure of days.	
139###				Creation by speech.

145###				Man created from the soil.	
146###				Man created from the blood of slain hero. (kingu).  VI. 33	
147###				It is possible these tablets are older than any copies of Scripture that we have, but this does not mean they are a more reliable record just because they are older. Of necessity, the first task of inspiration would be to supplant the often absurd and childish traditions of men with a revelation of the true history (thePentateuch), and such history we find in words of matchless grandeur, and in an order which, rightly understood, is absolutely scientific.

165###				Creation	
166###				Fall of Man

171###				Jacob	
172###				Joseph	
173###				Special Features: 	
174###				Genesis is the foundation for all following Scriptures.	
175###				The book of Genesis provides an essential foundation for the remainder of the Pentateuch and all subsequent Biblical revelation. Although accounts of "Creation", "The Flood",and the "Tower of Babel" can be found throughout the ancient civilizations, itis the only trustworthy and mature record concerning the beginnings of theuniverse, humankind, marriage, sin, cities, languages, nations, Israel, and thepurpose of God in all of these things.	
176###				The Title of This Book	
177###				The title of this book given to it in the Greek Septuagint means "creation" or "generation"and the Jews refer to Genesis as "Bereshith" meaning "in the beginning."	
178###				Genesis is a Book Origins	
179###				It was the first book of the Bible written (with the possible exception of Job).	
180###				The history of Genesis reveals that the material universe is distinctly God"s work and not some independent process. (Fifty times in chapters one and two are found verbs expressing what God did--God made, saw, said, formed)	
181###				Genesis is the book of firsts: recording the first marriage, first family, first birth,first sin, first murder, first polygamist, first musical instruments, and the first promise of redemption. The covenant made to Abraham in 12:1-3 is centralto all Scripture.	
182###				Genesis alone explains the origin of the twelve tribes of Israel. Genesis reveals how the descendants of Abraham ended up in Egypt for 430 years and thus sets the stage for the Exodus, the central redemption event of the Old Testament.	
183###				New Testament Fulfilment:	
184###				Genesis reveals the prophetic history of redemption and a Redeemer as coming through the seed of the woman (3:15), the line of Seth (4:25,26), the line of Shem(9:26,27), and through the seed of Abraham (12:3.) The New Testament applies Genesis12:3 directly to God"s provision of redemption in Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:16,29.)	
185###				Numerous persons and events from Genesis are mentioned in the New Testament in relation to:	
186###				Faith and Righteousness (Romans4; Hebrews 11:1-22)	
187###				God's Judgment (Luke16:26-29,32; II Peter 3:5; Jude 7, 11a)	
188###				The Person of Jesus Christ (Matthew1:1; John 8:58; Hebrews 7)

308###				God (Before Man)  1:1-25	
309###				God is eternally existent. In the beginning God…	
310###				The Bible never attempts to prove the existence of God, but merely acceptsHis eternal existence as a foregone conclusion. God is eternally existent and preceded all matter and persons. (Deut. 32:40; 33:27; Job 36:26; Psalm 9:7;Isa. 57:15; Rev. 1:8)	
311###				Hebrews 11:6--…he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.	
312###				The foundation of Christianity is faith. In the fullness of time, this faith can be confirmed by observable facts. Although filled with scientifically accurate material, the intent of Scripture is not to give a world history or ascientific exegesis of all things natural. Only the first two chapters aredevoted to a synopsis of creation and it promptly proceeds to the maincourse--God"s dealings with man and specifically, the Hebrew people. All thebooks of the Old Testament concern themselves with this thought.	
313###				As both Creationism and Evolution require faith, It would seem the only necessity for the idea of evolution is to create a situation where man can be independent of God and free to establish his own rules of life. Evolution is the  religion of the atheist. To believe in the religion of evolution is to beanti-God in that it is in stark contrast to the record of Scripture, God"s HolyWord.	
314###				God is the Creator of all things 	
315###				God--"Elohim" supreme God; superlative; creative glory (found in 180 verses in Genesis; 2,249 verses in the O.T.) Gen. 6:7;Isa. 43:15; John 1:3; Heb. 1:10; I Peter 4:19	
316###				All things have their beginning and source in God. Even Lucifer was created by God and had his beginning in God. As a beautiful angelic being on whom God bestowed great privilege, Lucifer rebelled against the order of Godand fell into the condemnation of the devil. (Isaiah 14:12; I Timothy 3:6; Gen.3:1) 	
317###				In any sense, God did not author evil, but in His desire to have a creation that out of its own free-will chose to serve Him, He provided the freedom of choice. Good -evil are not created items, but descriptions of the choices of the will.In absolutely no way can we attribute evil to God.	
318###				Before God there was nothing and without God there is nothing. (Gen. 1:1; John 1:1-3) Only God can create something out of nothing.	
319###				The 7 Days of  Creation	
320###				Day 1	
321###				1:3-5	
322###				Created the light and divided the light from the darkness.	
323###				Day 2	
324###				1:6-8	
325###				Created the firmament and called it heaven.	
326###				Day 3	
327###				1:9-13	
328###				Caused dry land to appear with grass - trees, -  named waters seas.	
329###				Day 4	
330###				1:14-19	
331###				Created the Sun, moon - stars.	
332###				Day 5	
333###				1:20-23	
334###				Created the creatures of the water and birds.	
335###				Day 6	
336###				1:24-31	
337###				Created beasts, creeping things and man.	
338###				Day 7	
339###				2:1-3	
340###				God Rested.	
341###				Genesis' Record of Creation is God's Record	
342###				Do Chapter's 1 - 2 contradict each Other? 	
343###				The sequential differences of the creative events recorded in chapters one and two have been the topic of much criticism. In chapter one, the purpose of the writer is to give a brief summary of the highlights of creation. In chapter two, the writer is establishing theplace of man in this creation while reiterating material already covered in chapter one. There is no contradiction found here. It is because the author"s purpose changes when chapter two begins, that we see any differences.Again, these differences are still never contradictory, but only the details that achieve the specific goal of the Author are reiterated while unnecessary details are left out. 	
344###				Always keep in mind the ultimate intent of the Old Testament Scriptures. Their intent is not to investigate every scientific detail of the natural world or even to give a complete history of humanity, but is to follow God's dealings with the nation of Israel. 	
345###				Not every conversation that ever took place is recorded, not every event is remembered, and not even every singular thought of God could possibly have been preserved in the 66 books of the Bible. Details are intentionally left out when they are diversions from theAuthor"s motive and purpose. Only the details that God has determined in His infinite wisdom necessary to the revelation of God's will for man are recorded.uWhen seeking to understand difficult passages, subject Scripture to the light of its intentions,

363###				Scripture bases its authenticity and authority on the fact of Divine inspiration. The Divine inspiration of Scripture is evidenced by the combination of these proofs: 	
364###				The Preservation of Scripture	
365###				No book has been as fervently fought through the ages and yet it has triumphantly endured.	
366###				The Accuracy of Scripture	
367###				The claims it makes for itself, God and the function of the natural world and humanity can be tested and observed as true.	
368###				The Prophecy of Scripture	
369###				The accuracy of its prophetic statements has been found far superior to any other work of prophecy. The Bible is more up to date than this morning's newspaper.	
370###				The Relevance of Scripture	
371###				Simply put, it works! Its principles can be practically applied and found true. 	
372###				Authenticity of Evolution	
373###				Evolution claims to base its authenticity on the advancements of scientific thought--that is, the laws of observable facts.This scientific thought is constantly changing as understanding of our worldchanges.	
374###				Evolution is not a science, however, but is more of a religion that requires faith. As a theory, it postulates for millions of transitional species that have never been seen. It does not even attempt to answer the question of origin, but makesastronomically sized assumptions and moves from there. The only variations ofspecies to be scientifically observed have been a)harmful anddetrimental b)only differences within the species and not thedevelopment of new species altogether.

376###				The Nature of God	
377###				Although God's existence is a foregone conclusion, the nature of God is extensively detailed in Scripture. All that Christians know and doctrinally claim concerning God is revealed in the pages of the Bible. In the Hebrew Old Testament, there are manynames<a href='#endNotes' >[9]</a> or titles referring to God, and each is uniquely descriptive. Much ofthe nature of God can be understood by a look at these names.	
378###				Jehovah (YVWH) --the Covenant Name of God--is the most popular and widely used. It is used in conjunction with different words establishing the correlation of God's promises and God's name. (Heb. 6:13; 15:3; Ps 83:18; Mark 13:31; Ps. 138:2)The use of Jehovah is signaled in the KJV by the use of all capitalletters: LORD.	
379###				Elohim is perhaps the most comprehensive name of God. It expresses the Trinity and the fullness of the Godhead. It also expresses the creative power and glory of God.

501###				Adam 1:26-5:28	
502###				The name Adam means earthy; red	
503###				Earthy – The Lord formed man out of the dust of the earth. (Gen. 2:7; 3:9; 18:27) Without God man is just dirt.It was not until God breathed into man the breath of His life that man became aliving soul. We are formed from the ground, but God is the sourceof all ulife. In this lesson we see clearly the futility of humanitywithout God.	
504###				Red is possibly a reference to red clay and earth, but also brings our thoughts to blood. The life of the flesh is in the blood…(Lev. 17:11). More important than the blood that pumped through Adam"s veins which was affected by sin is theinnocent blood of the Second Adam who would come and destroy the powerof the serpent. (Gen. 3:15)	
505###				Placed in the Garden of Eden and commanded to dress and keep it. 2:5,15	
506###				Eden – The beautiful paradise that God created was possibly situated somewhere between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads--Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel,- Euphrates. (Gen.2:10-14). It is important to note that the Flood may have dramatically rerouted the Euphrates River and the geographic picture we seetoday may be tremendously different from what was before the torrents of thegreat deluge.	
507###				Dress and Keep – In the garden utopia Adam was not free to lounge 247, but was given great responsibility that accompanied his authority (Gen. 1:26). From this passage we may safelyconclude that labor and work was not the curse following sin, but merely thesweat, difficulty and futility of it. (Gen. 3:17-19) Also, part of Adam"sresponsibility was to keep the garden, that is, to protect; guard;preserve and also includes the idea of performing the part of a watchman.There was a serpent operating right under Adam"s nose and he didn"t even notice until it was too late. We have a great responsibility to take care of and guardthe gifts that God gives us. Let us not be slack in our duty, but watchful.(I Peter 5:8) 	
508###				Adam and Eve were driven from garden. Gen. 3:22-24	
509###				The commandment was given to Adam.He was not deceived as Eve, but made a wilful choice against God's command.(Gen. 2:16,17; I Tim. 2:14) 	
510###				It was because of his sin that they were driven from the garden and more importantly the close communion Adam enjoyed with God in the garden was lost. Sin separates man from God and bringsspiritual and physical death. Adam lived 930 years. He lived to be acontemporary of Lamech, Noah"s father. Although that is a long life by today"sstandard, death was not in God"s will. Death is a result of sin

541###				Noah  5:29-10:7	
542###				The name Noah means rest,	
543###				Following Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden, sin grew like leprosy on earth. In his jealousy, Cain murdered his own brother. God judges Cain making him a fugitive, but would not hold others guiltless in taking Cain"s life (God set a mark upon Cain). The influence of sin was everywhere and growing every day. We see the degeneration of man (…every imagination of the thoughts of his [humanity] heart was only evil continually.-6:5) epitomized in "Lamech I" (4:18-24), a sixth generation descendant of Cain. He not only had two wives, but he murdered two men. It was upon this scene of sin's broad influence in the earth into which Noah was born to "Lamech II" (an eighth generation descendent of Seth). 	
544###				Genesis 5:29--And he called his name Noah, saying, uThis same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.	
545###				Noah was a sign to his generation of a rest from the futile toil of sin and of the salvation ofGod. (Ps. 37:7; Jer. 6:16; Heb. 4:9;)	
546###				Noah's Family	
547###				He was the tenth in descent fromAdam, in the line of Seth, the son of Lamech and grandson of Methuselah. We hear nothing of Noah until he is 500 years old when he begat three sons, Shem,Ham and Japheth. 	
548###				Noah's Life	
549###				Who Was Noah?	
550###				Through faith he built an ark to the saving of his household. (I Pt. 3:20; Heb.11:7) During the period of building the ark it is said that he was a righteous man and perfect in hisgenerations (i.e. among his contemporaries), and that he, like Enoch, walkedwith God. (Gen. 6:9; 2 Peter 2:5) He was 600 years old at the Flood andlived 950 years. He lived approximately 2948 BC to 1998 BC.	
551###				Person Number 8 out of 8 People on the Ark Or The 8th Preacher of Righteousness	
552###				II Peter 2:5--And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;	
553###				I Peter 3:20--… few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. (Genesis7:1-24)	
554###				Adam Clarke's Commentary:	
555###				[Saved Noah the eighth]  Some think that the words should be translated, Noah the eighth preacher of righteousness;  but it seems most evident, from 1Pe 3:20, that eight persons are here meant, which were the whole that were saved in the ark,  viz. Shem, Ham, Japheth, and their three wives,six; Noah's wife seven; and Noah himself the eighth.  The form of expression,  ogdoonmwe, "Noah the eighth", that is, "Noah and seven more", is most common in the Greek language.<a href='#endNotes' >[10]</a>

595###				DIFFERENCES BEFORE AND AFTER THE FLOOD	
596###				Was the world different after the flood from how it was before the flood?	
597###				CANOPY – One possible difference in the world before the flood was water above the earth. During the second creative day the Bible says God separated the waters above the earth from the waters below the earth.Then God said to let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters, and God called the expanse Heaven. 	
598###				This has been interpreted various ways. Some have seen this as referring to a water vapor canopy that enveloped the earth. Such a canopy would have produced a greenhouse effect keeping the climate at a moderate temperature worldwide. This would allow for rich vegetation as well as long life for the inhabitants of the earth.	
599###				RAIN CLOUDS – A second school of thought concerning the firmament is that it may have consisted of ordinary rain clouds. This lineof thought argues against the idea of a canopy, by quoting Psalm148:4-6. According to this passage, the waters above were still in existencewhen the Psalmist wrote. Furthermore, the psalm states that they would remainforever by the unalterable decree of God.	
600###				NO RAIN – The Bible possibly teaches that there was no rain before the Flood (Gen. 2:5). But there went up a mist from the earth,and watered the whole face of the ground.--2:6. There is no reference ofrain having fallen until the time of the deluge. The argument is essentiallyfrom the silence of the Bible, for there is no definitive statement in eithercase, for we merely assume that from the time of the creation no changetakes place until the Flood.	
601###				UNIFORM CLIMATE – The climate before the Flood may have been more uniform than today, that is, not having the same extremes intemperature. The Bible seems to indicate that the seasons wereestablished after the flood.--Gen. 8:22. 	
602###				VEGETARIANS – Scripture possibly teaches that humankind and the animals were not meat eaters until after the Flood. This conclusion may be drawn from Genesis 1:29.	
603###				LONGEVITY – Before the Flood, the people lived much longer. This longevity created a scenario where Adam could have rehearsed thestory of the "beginning" directly to the ears of hisgreat-great-great-great-great-great grandson, Lamech (Noah"s father). The longlives of these Patriarchs definitely increase the probability of an accuraterecord of the beginning being preserved through the ages. Observation two: Adamlived long enough to witness the results of his fall in the Garden  unto eightgenerations. Observation three: The longevity of life before the flood may be attributed to possible factors: 1)The degeneration of all things that was the result of sin was not as developed until after the Flood and 2)the world beforethe flood was a much healthier environment and with a more uniform climatepossibly enhanced by the greenhouse effect of a protective canopy.

723###				IX.Nimrod    10:8-11:9	
724###				a.The name Nimrod means firm	
725###				Stubborn and rebellious against divine authority, Nimrod was a common specimen of his generation. The rebellion of this age culminated with the Tower of Babel.	
726###				b.He claimed to be a "mighty one in the earth." I Chr. 1:10	
727###				Babel was the beginning of his kingdom, which he gradually enlarged (10:8-10). The "land of Nimrod"(Micah 5:6) is a designation of Assyria or of Shinar.	
728###				c.The Cult that Formed around the legendary Nimrod.																																								<!-DONT TRANSLATE THIS--><a href='#endNotes' >[12]</a>	
729###				Nimrod was married to his own mother, Semiramis, the Queen of Babylon. Satan used them to create a cult so powerful that it spread around the world and multitudes look to Semiramis astheir goddess mother. Nimrod was known by many names including "Moloch." Babies were sacrificed in his honor. (Lev. 18:21; Acts 7:43) At this time, we find thebeginning of confessions, celibacy for priests, - motherinfantworship as we see in Roman Catholicism.	
730###				When Nimrod was put to death, the people wept. Semiramis moved quickly and took advantage of the situation. Supposedly a virgin, Semiramis gave birth to another child and claimed that Nimrod had been reincarnated. The child was called Tammuz. He became the sun god, Baal.(Halos)	
731###				Semiramis became a goddess with many names. Her names include:Baalti (the Madonna), the GreatGoddess Mother, Queen of Heaven, The Mediatrix, The Mother of Mankind, Astarte,etc. As time went on, monuments of the goddess mother and her child appeared inmany nations. When the people of Babylon were scattered to various parts of theearth, they took with them the worship of the divine mother and child. uTheearth was in darkness.	
732###				Around 300 A.D., when RomanCatholicism came into existence, Constantine knew if he would adopt the worship of the goddess mother into their religious system then countless pagans would convert to Roman Catholicism. (Catholic means universal.)	
733###				X.Abraham 11:10-25:18	
734###				A.The Early Life of Abraham	
735###				Abraham was named Abram at birth (meaning: father of a multitude.) He was the son of Terah and the founding patriarch of the great Hebrew nation. He lived approximately from1996-1822 B.C. His family, a branch of the descendants of Shem, was settled inUr of the Chaldees, beyond the Euphrates. 	
736###				Terah had two other sons, Nahor and Haran. Haran died in Ur of the Chaldees, leaving a son, Lot. Sometime following Haran's death, Terah took Abram, with Sarai his wife and his grandsonLot, and emigrated north to the city of Haran in Mesopotamia. Although the nameof his son "Haran" and the name of the city "Haran" are spelled identical inEnglish, they are spelled differently in the Hebrew. Terah died while in Haran.br clear=all 	
737###				B.The Land of Promise	
738###				READ GENESIS CHAPTERS 12 THROUGH14.	
739###				After the death of his father,Abram, 75-years-old, with Sarai and Lot, pursued the land of Canaan. It was byDivine direction and command he chose this course when he received the general promise that he would become the founder of a great nation in Genesis 12:1-3.	
740###				He passed through the heart of the country by the great highway to Shechem. SichemShechem means "the neck(between the shoulders); the place of burden." It was in Shechem where here ceived in vision from Jehovah the further revelation that this was the landwhich his descendants should inherit. Abram put his shoulder to the task andbared the responsibility of fulfilling the will of God. The Chrisitan life isnot all ease, but is filled with duty and responsibility. We must take the workof God seriously and with earnestness.	
741###				The next halting-place of the sojourner was on a mountain between Bethel and Ai where he built an altar. At the time, the country was suffering from famine and Abram journeyed still southward to therich corn-lands of Egypt. There, fearing that the great beauty of Sarai mighttempt the powerful monarch of Egypt and expose his own life to peril, hearranged that Sarai should call herself his sister. Sarai was probably thedaughter of his brother Haran which made their story at best a "half-truth."Sarai"s beauty was reported to the king of Egypt, and she was taken into the royal harem. The deception was discovered, and Pharaoh with some indignation dismissed Abram from the country although with great possessions. Accompanied by tag-a-longLot, Abram returned north to southern Palestine to his former encampmentbetween Bethel and Ai. 	
742###				Eventually, Abram and Lot parted ways. The increased wealth of the two kinsmen was the ultimate cause of their separation. 	
743###				Genesis13:6,7a--And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen ofLot's cattle:	
744###				Abram gave Lot the choice for a possession of land and he chose the fertile plain of the Jordan near Sodom. Abram continued his journey as a nomad in obedience to God.	
745###				Genesis 13:17--Arise,walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.	
746###				While Abram had pitched his tent in the plain of Mamre (close to Hebron) where he built an altar, Lot was being taken captive by Chedorlaomer king of Elam, who had invaded Sodom. When news ofLot"s abduction reached Abram, he pursued the conquerors and utterly routed thefour kings that had defeated five other kings. God had blessed Abram with thisvictory not very far from Damascus. The captives and plunder were allrecovered, and Abram was greeted on his return by the king of Sodom, and byMelchizedek king of Salem, priest of the Most-High God, who mysteriously appears upon the scene to bless and receive from him a tenth of the spoil. The three-times-repeated promise that his descendants should become a mighty nationand possess the land in which he was a stranger was then confirmed with all thesolemnity of a religious ceremony. Abram refused even a "shoe-latchet" from thespoil of his victory so that none could say "I have made Abram rich." Abramsecured his blessing from God in refusing every other source. All the glorybelonged to God.	
747###				C.The Production of the Flesh	
748###				READ GENESIS CHAPTERS 15 THROUGH 17 AND 21:1-21.	
749###				Ten years had passed since he had left his father's house, and the fulfilment of the promise was apparently more distant than at first. At the suggestion of Sarai, who despaired of havingchildren of her own, he took as his concubine Hagar. Hagar was Sarai"s Egyptianmaid. Hagar bore Ishmael when Abram was 86 years old. Although Abram now had ason, this was NOT the accomplishment of the Divine promise.	
750###				Thirteen years elapsed, during which Abram still dwelt in Hebron, when the covenant was renewed, and the rite of circumcision established as its sign. Here, when he was 99 years old, is Abram"sname was changed to Abraham, (meaning: father of many nations)and Sarai"s name became Sarah. The promise that Sarah should have a sonwas repeated in the remarkable scene described in chapter 18. Three men stoodbefore Abraham as he sat in his tent door in the heat of the day. The patriarch,with true Eastern hospitality, welcomed the strangers, and bade them rest and refresh themselves. The meal ended, they foretold the birth of Isaac, and wenton their way to Sodom. Abraham pleads with God for Sodom and through Abraham"sintercession Lot and his family were saved.	
751###				At length, Isaac, the promised son, was born. Sarah was angered by the mockery of Ishmael at the "great banquet" which Abraham made to celebrate the weaning of his son. In Genesis21:10, Sarah demanded that Ishmael and Hagar should be driven out.	
752###				D.Promised Son and a Test	
753###				READ GENESIS 22.	
754###				Despite the great struggle within his own house, the severest trial of Abraham"s faith was yet to come. For possibly 25-30 years, the Biblical record is silent concerning Abraham, but at lengthhe receives the strange command to take Isaac, his only son, and offer him fora burnt offering at an appointed place. Abraham did not hesitate to obey. 	
755###				Hebrews 11:17-19--By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, 18 Of whom it was said, That inIsaac shall thy seed be called: 19 Accounting that God was able to raise himup, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.	
756###				The sacrifice was stayed by the angel of Jehovah, the promise of spiritual blessing was made for the first time, and Abraham with his son returned to Beersheba.	
757###				Your treasured possession is never really yours until you have come to the place (Mount Moriah) where you release it to God. Matthew 16:25	
758###				Isaac was the child of God's promise. There was no sin in Abraham having him, but Abraham had to be willing to lose him to God, before he couldreally keep him.	
759###				Matt.16:25; Eccl. 3:6; Prov.23:26; Psalm 37:4; I Chron. 15:15; Gen. 22:7	
760###				The Lord required of Abraham that which was PRECIOUS to him.Isaac was the long prayed for and desired son. What is precious to you? (Aposition in ministry? Etc.)	
761###				V.13,14 Jehovah-jireh the Lord my Provider --Isaac was not to be Abraham's hope. Abraham's hope had to rest solely in God.	
762###				For a time, Abraham dwelt inBeersheba, but we find him after a few years in his original residence atHebron, for there Sarah died, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah. Theremaining years of Abraham's life are marked by few incidents. After Isaac'smarriage with Rebekah and his removal to Lahai-roi, Abraham took to wifeKeturah, by whom he had six children, Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbokand Shuah, who became the ancestors of nomadic tribes inhabiting the countries south and south-east of Palestine. Abraham lived to see the gradual accomplishment of the promise in the birth of his grandchildren Jacob and Esau,and witnessed their growth to manhood. At the goodly age of 175 he was"gathered to his people," and laid beside Sarah in the tomb ofMachpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael.

870###				XI.Isaac            25:19-35:29	
871###				Isaac was the son of Abraham andSarah whose name means laughter. (17:17; 18:12; 21:6.) He was born atGerar when Abraham was 100 years of age and Sarah was about 90 years old. (17:17-21;21:3-12)	
872###				Isaac"s is one of the few cases which God selected a name for a child and announced it before he was born. In the Old Testament we have: Isaac, Ishmael, Solomon, Josiah, Cyrus, and Isaiah"sson; in the New Testament we have: John the Baptist and Jesus.	
873###				Isaac is the child of the covenant and was circumcised at eight days old. According to Josephus, Isaac was 25years old at his offering on Mount Moriah in Genesis 22:12. Isaac is also typicalof Christ who gave Himself for our sins. Isaac"s mother, Sarah, died when hewas 36 years old. After his mother"s death, Isaac married Rebekah. Isaac is theonly Patriarch that had only one wife. This account in Genesis 24 is typical tous of the Bride of Christ. Isaac had two sons: Jacob and Esau. Isaac lived 180years.

893###				XII.Jacob 25:26-47:31	
894###				Jacob means supplanter, that is, the heel-holder, one who comes behind and catches the heel of his adversary.He was the twin brother to Esau who was the elder. God transformed Jacob the Supplanter into Israel The Prince of God. There was a great process to Jacob"s character development and no other Bible character represents more fully the conflict between the lower and higher nature, than Jacob.	
895###				Beginning on the downgrade, Jacob"slife reaches glorious heights only to sink again into the sordid struggle for gain. Jacob emergences at the very last upon the plane of triumphant faith. in spite of all his weaknesses, no devout reader who studies the history of this man"s career can doubt that he was a chosen instrument of God.	
896###				KEYTHOUGHTS	
897###				There are two key thoughts which open up his life and throw light upon his history: 	
898###				1) The unhappiness produced by family trouble and polygamy.	
899###				This fact is illustrated throughout his entire career. 	
900###				2) The transforming power of fellowship with God. 	
901###				This truth shines clearly through all the loftier experiences of this chosen man. In the diagram an attempt is made to illustrate the human and Divine elements manifested in his life. The crooked line marks the mountain peaks and low levels of his career. 	
902###				NOTE:The letters refer to points on the diagram.	
903###				[13]EARLY LIFE. Down grade, domestic trouble.	
904###				(A)He cheats his brother, Esau,out of his birthright, 25:39-34	
905###				(B)He deceives his aged father,27:1-29	
906###				(C)He flees to Haran seeking to save his life. 27:41; 28:1-5.	
907###				A NIGHT EXPERIENCE ON A HIGHER LEVEL.

909###				IN HARAN. Family trouble continues.	
910###				(E) TheRomance of love spoiled by deception concerning his marriage, 29:15-30	
911###				(F) The struggle with his father-in-law, and the jealousy between his wives, 30:1-43.	
912###				(G) An upward movement, the Divine call to return to the Promised Land, 31:3. Departing secretlyhe is pursued by his father-in-law, 31.	
913###				(H) On his pathway of obedience he is met by angelic messengers, 32:1,2.	
914###				ANOTHER GREAT SPIRITUALEXPERIENCE	
915###				(I) Esau"s approach with four hundred men causes him to resort to prayer, 32:3-12	
916###				(J) He spends a night wrestling with an angel in desperate entreaty. He gains the victory and hisname is changed to "Israel," 32:24-32. He has an affectionate meeting with hisbrother, Esau, 33:1-16.	
917###				(K) His daughterDinah is defiled, 34:1-5.	
918###				(L) In a spirit of revenge his sons bring trouble upon him, 34:7-31.	
919###				(M)Arriving atBethel, he remembers his former vision there and builds an altar, 35:1-15.	
920###				LATER YEARS. Domestic trouble still continues.	
921###				(N) Parental partiality and family jealousy leads to Joseph being sold into Egypt, 37:1-36.	
922###				(O) Other family troubles, 38:1-30.	
923###				(P) Joseph"s exaltation and Divine call to Egypt, 39 to 45; 46:1-4	
924###				HIS LAST DAYS	
925###				(Q) Dying he blesses his grandsons and sons, 48; 49.	
926###				(R) By many it is thought he prophesied the coming of the Messiah, 49:10	
927###				XIII.Joseph      30:1-50:26	
928###				Rachel was barren and very frustrated because of it. She even turned her frustration on her husband, Jacoband blamed him for her barrenness. Out of their marital spat sprouted a plan inRachel"s mind--they would borrow from Abraham and Sarah"s idea ofsubstitutionary impregnation. This and further competitive efforts with Leahresulted in ten children for Jacob, but failed to satisfy the heart of Rachelbecause the desire of her heart was to have a child of her own. Verse 22 saysthat God "remembered" Rachel and gave her a son. This does not infer that God forgot Rachel, but emphasizes the point God recognized or was mindful of her at this ordained time. Rachel felt forgotten and worthless, but God hada plan to bless her.	
929###				 Rachel"s self-worth was wrapped upin her ability to give Jacob at least one son and she felt like a reproachbecause of her barrenness. Her testimony of victory was that God had taken awayher reproach in given her a son, Joseph. Only God can take away the reproach ofsin. There is no ability in man to please God outside of the redemptive work ofChrist. No effort of the sinner can produce life, but by the miracle ofsalvation is our "barrenness" and "reproach" removed! Not only did God heal herbarrenness and remove her reproach, but he restored her faith. She called her son Joseph meaning may God add or increase; added because she knew theLord would add to her another son. She was right because she eventually gavebirth to Benjamin. Alas, Rachel died from the difficulty of his birth.	
930###				Joseph was one of the most outstanding men of the Bible because of his personal character and despiteintense difficulties overall excellence in life. Joseph was a youthful dreamer whosedreams came true even they he was initially rejected by his brethren. Hold onto the dreams God gives because they are the compass for life. Jacob"s favoritismin giving him the coat of many colors and even the Lord"s special attention toJoseph in giving him dreams of future exaltation provoked his brothers to envy.	
931###				COAT: It was a coat of long sleeves which was the garment of a boss and not a worker. It was a coat of many colorswhich greatly differed from everyday work clothes which necessitated noexpensive dyes or colorings. The coat undeniably made a distinction betweenJoseph and his brethren. (His father"s special favor toward Joseph was becauseof Rachel.)	
932###				DREAM 1: His brothers" sheaves of wheat bowed down to Joseph"s sheaf.	
933###				DREAM 2: Sun, Moon and Eleven Stars bowed down to Joseph.	
934###				Joseph was enslaved, falsely accused and forgotten by men,but was faithful even in the hard places. Joseph enjoyed the presence of Godand won the confidence of his master. Joseph had physical good looks, but itwas never a snare to him. Joseph resisted temptation and was silent amid foulaccusations and unjust punishment. Joseph the interpreter of dreams proved that"prison walls do not a prisoner make." Joseph is a perfect type of Christ andof the Overcomer. Joseph manifested great wisdom, brotherly love, filialdevotion and utter submission to God. (Gen. 43:20; 45:8,14,23; 47:7.) He knew how to return good for evil and God preserved his family through hisgenerosity.

1030###				INTRODUCING EXODUS	
1031###				  The title of this Book comes fromthe Septuagint in which it is called "Exodus" which means "going out."This title refers to the Israelite "going out" from Egypt. This book is calledin Hebrew Bibles "these are the names" (Weelleh Shemoth) which is the  opening clause of the book. The introductory genealogy shows how in arelatively short time, Israel and His family greatly multiplied literallyfulfilling God"s promise to Abraham. The book of Exodus was probably onceconjoined as one book with Genesis and comprises a period of about one hundred and forty-five years, from the death of Joseph to the construction of the tabernacle in the desert.  	
1032###				I.Suffering in Egypt (1:1-13:16)	
1033###				A.TheSlavery of the Israelites (CH. 1)	
1034###				Israel was a small nomadic people("70 souls" 1:5) going into Egypt, but were fruitful and multiplied so that theland was filled with them (1:7). At the Exodus, there were approximately twomillion Jews.	
1035###				Pharaoh gifted the fertile landsand river delta of the mighty Nile River known as Goshen to Joseph"sfamily. This land started as a land of liberty and abundance, but eventuallywas transformed into a land of bondage. Joseph, his brethren, and all their generationdied and a new king rose to power that "knew not Joseph." [The Hyksos ("foreignrulers" from the Northeast) may have invaded Egypt shortly have Joseph"s death.This fact might be part of why the Hebrews fell out of favor with the Egyptiansso seemingly fast. ] This Pharaoh feared the great numbers of Israel and instituted a plan of affliction. The Egyptians discovered that the harder they afflicted the Hebrews, the more they prospered! During the most intense periodsof persecution, the Church of God has grown. The winds of persecution only fanthe fires of revival! Let us compare some of the phrases describing Israel andthe efforts of Pharaoh:	
1036###				ISRAELITES	
1037###				EGYPTIANS	
1038###				Fruitful, increased abundantly, multiplied, waxed  exceeding mighty, land was filled with them, more and mightier than we  [EGYPTIANS]	
1039###				Set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their  burdens, built for Pharaoh, they were grieved because of…Israel, [make] to  serve with rigour, made lives bitter with hard bondage	
1040###				the more the Jews multiplied and grew	...
1041###				...The more the Egyptians afflicted the Jews	
1042###				the people multiplied and waxed very mighty	
1043###				if it be  a son, then ye shall kill him	
1044###				Pharaoh" strategy to kill the male children failed utterly because the midwives chose to fear God over man. Godprotected and blessed the midwives, Shiprah and Puah, for their courage. "Godmade them houses," that is, He protected them and allowed them to have manychildren themselves. Pharaoh responded to this rebellion by opening the chargeof murder to every Egyptian. It is upon this bloody and dangerous scene thatMoses made his entrance as an innocent Levite baby. This decree was probably given sometime after Aaron"s birth and retracted very shortly after Moses'birth. (Perhaps, baby Moses' influence on Pharaoh's daughter had something todo with its end.)	
1045###				B.TheCall of Moses to be Leader and Deliverer (CH. 2-4)	
1046###				2:1-4 Moses" Parents Plan: TrustGod Both being Levites, Amram and Jochebed married. They had two children before Moses, Aaron and Miriam. The Scripture says that Miriam took notice thatMoses was a "goodly" child. A mother has ever seen an ugly baby, but maybe thelooming edict of death caused Jochebed to appreciate her healthy baby boy alittle more. Every new life is so precious and a gift from God. Pharoah"s edictwas horrendous and can only be compared to the hundreds of millions of abortions that that have been committed in the past 40 years. One look at that sweet, happy baby and Jochebed was determined no one, not even Pharaoh, was going to kill her baby. For three months she hid him. She had to muffle everycry and perhaps cover him with blankets every time she heard voices or foot stepsoutside. Jochebed took every precaution and was a diligent guardian of herprecious cargo, but she realized, as her baby grew, it was only a matter oftime before he would be discovered.	
1047###				Exodus 2:3--And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid itin the flags by the river's brink.	
1048###				The ark was a small boat or basket made of the Egyptian reed called papyrus. This was a somewhat common application in Egypt because more sturdy resources were not plenteous.	
1049###				2:5-10 Discovered, Named andRaised by Pharaoh's Daughter. Miriam patiently guarded her brother placed gently among the protective "flags" or reeds (probably papyrus). By instinctivemotherly precautions and Divine appointment, the ark was placed in plain sightto Pharaoh"s daughter as she bathed in the Nile. This was a bold move, butbecause God was leading the way, Moses was as safe as he possibly could be! Thebaby touched the heart of Pharaoh"s daughter and because she drew him out ofthe water, she named him Moses. Pharaoh's daughter (HistorianJosephus suggests her  name was Thermuthis) commissioned Moses' own mother to nurse and care for him until he was weaned. In Pharaoh"s house, Mosesbenefited from the knowledge and luxuries of Egypt. After all the thoroughtraining Egypt had to offer, Moses still had much to learn about following Godand leading God"s people.	
1050###				Acts 7:22--AndMoses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.	
1051###				2:11-15 Moses Murders and Flees.Moses was dissatisfied and incomplete abiding in Pharaoh"s place. He makes an amazing to choice to be with his Hebrew people instead of with the Egyptians. Oneday Moses took an inspective look at the condition of the Hebrews and was greatly angered as he witnessed the unjust treatment his people endure. 	
1052###				Exodus2:11,12--…he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 12 …he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.	
1053###				Moses heart was to deliver his people from their bondage, but this was NOT God"s method. God had a plan that involved the Egyptians sending off the Hebrews and giving them riches as apartial restitution. (3:21) Moses had to flee for his life to Midian because there were witnesses to his murder and Pharaoh sought for his life.	
1054###				2:16-22 Moses Rescues the Daughters of Reul and Dwells in Midian. Midian is a land of Arabia east of the Red Sea near Mount Sinai. When Moses reached Midian, he witnessed thebullying of the seven daughters of the priest Reul. Moses plays the part of a hero and defends them against the brutish shepherds. As a reward for his heroics, he was invited for supper and eventually given Zipporah to marry.Zipporah gave birth to Gershom whose name means a stranger here orrefugee. Moses also had a second son named Eliezar (18:4), but mysteriouslythere is no mention of him in this particular passage. The addition would be necessary here because Exodus 4:20 says that Moses took his wife and sons with him when he eventually returned to Egypt.Moses took up the vocation of shephered during his forty years in Midian.	
1055###				Exodus 3:1--NowMoses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian:	
1056###				When comparing Exodus 2:18 and 3:1,there is some explanation necessary to justify the use of the two names "Reul"and "Jethro" for both of these names are seemingly given as names for Moses"father-in-law. The identical Hebrew word we translate father-in-law in Exodus3:1 is translated son-in-law in Genesis 19:14. Many learned scholars of Hebreware puzzled by this word, but it seems to be a general term for a relativeby marriage, and the context of its use can only identify its precisemeaning. With this in mind, some have speculated that Reul was the name ofMoses" father-in-law and Jethro or Hobab was Reul"s son, and Moses"brother-in-law. It is still possible that Reul, Jethro, Raguel, Hobab, Keyniare all names of one man, Moses" father-in-law. A third possibility is Ruel wasthe grandfather of Zipporah and Jethro was the immediate father of the sevensisters and Moses" father-in-law. (Ex 2:18; 3:1; 4:18; 18:1; Nu 10:29; Judges1:16; 4:11) 	
1057###				2:23-4:28 God Sets His GreatPlan of Deliverance in Motion. About Forty years after Moses fled fromEgypt, the king of Egypt died. Pharaoh"s death made Moses" return to Egyptpossible since he had made search for Moses for murdering the Egyptian. Also,at this time the cry for deliverance among the Hebrew slaves was coming to a.climax. God heard their groaning and in remembrance of his covenant withAbraham, Isaac and Jacob and had respect unto them, that is, God regardedtheir plight and did not ignore their cry. 	
1058###				In response to Israel's cry, God set in motion his miraculous plan of deliverance by making a most unusual visit to Moses. Moses, who kept the flock of Jethro, led the flock to the backside ofthe desert to the mountain of God (this mountain had two peaks named Horeband Sinai. Sinai is the most popular name since it means bush andmakes reference to the miraculous visitation of God.) As he made his climb upthe mount, Moses was startled by the sight of a bush on fire that was notconsumed by the flame. The fact the bush did not burn up was a great curiosityto Moses and he turned aside to inspect it. The fire was not God, but God spokeout of the midst of the fire. God is spoken of as a fire in many other versesof Scripture, but only as a figure of speech. 	
1059###				1)The Fire that Did not Consume theBush spoke of God's mercy. Just as the bush was not consumed, Moses was able to speak with and look upon themanifestation of God without dying. The saints of God are not destroyed by thefire of God, but are purified by it! Compare Psalm 68:2 and Luke 3:16.	
1060###				2)AConsuming Fire speaks of the intensity and heat of God's jealousy for His people. (Deut. 4:24;9:3; Eze. 36:5; 2 Thess. 1:8; Rev. 20:9)	
1061###				Moses had several questions and although they were evidences of his own weaknesses, now was definitely the time to deal with them! If Moses waited until he stood before Pharaoh to count thecost and the ramifications of his quest, he might have backed down to the kingand made a hasty retreat. There is never a benefit in being anything less than100% open to God because there is no escaping His judgment. We can either faceHis anger now while it is mixed with mercy or later when eternal judgment isset. It does not get any easier by trying to avoid correction. Moses istransparent before God with his questions and after some rebuke and instructionfrom the Lord, he is all the better for it: 	
1062###				1Who amI? 3:11,12 God not only ordained Moses to speak, but gave him the very words to say. Moses was sent under the authority of Almighty God and not undersome birth right of his own.	
1063###				2What is Your name? 3:13-22 IAM (Compare with John 18:6.)	
1064###				3What if they do not believe me? 4:1-9 Two signs (The Rod - Leprosy) were given to Moses. They spoke of the call, will and authority ofGod. The minister of God goes in the name of God and thesesignsshall follow them that believe. (Mark 16:17)	
1065###				4Cansomeone else do this because I am not able to speak? 4:10-17 God responds with a very strong rebuke of Moses.	
1066###				In 4:18-26,Moses learned a serious lesson: God requires implicit (exact) obedience. God will keep His Word and expects us to keep our end of the bargain. Mosesslackness almost cost him his life and he was only rescued by the action ofZipporah.	
1067###				4:27-31 Moses is Reunited withAaron - Received by Israel. The people saw the signs and believed and worshipped God for His recognition of their bondage.	
1068###				TheChallenge of Pharaoh's Power (CH. 5-11)	
1069###				Nine times in this account we read the phrase "let My people go." It was God"s will that the Hebrews be free and He worked it out exactly as He had promised (3:21). It was God"swill that the Egyptians would send out the Hebrews and that Israel wouldnot gain their independence merely by a military revolt. This sending outwould eventually include the Egyptians giving much wealth and gifts to theHebrews as they left. 	
1070###				For this impossibility to take place much had to change in the hearts and minds of the Egyptians. God preparedPharaoh and the Egyptians for the great sending away of the Hebrews by establishingHe alone was God and there was no false god in Egypt that could stand againstJehovah. With precision greater than any surgeon, in only ten plagues Godmethodically embarrassed the supposed gods of Egypt.

1128###				It was because of Pharaoh's own choices that such terrible things came upon Egypt andGod took this opportunity not only to bring judgment on Egypt for hermistreatment of Israel, but also to humble her. There is only one God who madeHeaven and earth and there is NO God besides Him. This fact was undeniablyestablished by God"s great deliverance of the Hebrew slaves.

1131###				Israel's deliverance from Egypt is the  most important happening of the Old Testament (only their rejection ofChrist in the New Testament could be considered more important). The nightbefore Israel"s exodus was a night of solemn ceremony that would be rememberedforever (12:24).

1154###				The night before His crucifixion,Christ kept the Passover with His disciples. He is the final and true Passover lamb. The blood of Jesus Christ is the only means of exemption from thewages of sin!

Approximately 2-3 million Jewsleft Egypt. Exodus 12:40--Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, whodwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

1174###				God sent his "army" to stand between the hosts of Egypt and His people!	
1175###				Moses"Song and Miriam"s Dance (15:1-21)	
1176###				1The Singing of the Miracle	
1177###				"…I will sing unto the Lord…" v.1	
1178###				This Song of Moses is an act ofPRAISE, FAITH, - REJOICING. (In Deuteronomy 31:22, 30 Moses can be found singing again.) It is the action of the true and loving God to inspire song through atrial. 	
1179###				Francis Jane Van Alstyne (1820-1915) was a great Christian poet and hymn writer. Though blinded as an infant due to negligence of a doctor, Francis was known for her cheerful and happy disposition. She wroteover 9,000 songs and poems of praise to God! Publishers used many differentpseudonyms when publishing her songs so that their hymnals would not appear to have been almost entirely written by one person! (She is more commonly remembered by the pen name Fanny J. Crosby.)	
1180###				a)All the glory is GOD'S. 	
1181###				HIS Power, HIS Victory, HE IS a Man of War, the LORD isHIS name, hath HE cast, HIS right hand, in the greatness of THINE Excellency,THY wrath, THY nostrils, THY wind = "WHO IS LIKE UNTO THEE"	
1182###				b)This is a song of FAITH.	
1183###				God's great deliverance from under Pharaoh' hand, Pharaoh's destruction and the miracle of the parted waters with dry land created a personal faith in the Israelite"shearts. These acts were evidence to the fact that God"s Word was true andreliable.	
1184###				1)They saw for themselves WHO GOD IS.	
1185###				Instead of asking "Where is the God our Fathers?" as before, Moses and Israel shout "the LORD is become MY salvation" out of a new found knowledge and appreciation of WHOGod is. ("LORD"Jehovah is the covenant keeping name of God.)	
1186###				The phrase"The Lord is become" is descriptive of Israel's understanding and not a declaration that some metamorphosis has taken over God. God has not, will notand cannot change! In witnessing this great event, God has become magnified inthe eyes of the Hebrews. As when we witness the hand of God move in ourlives and our hearts are immediately full of the reality of the power, love and nearness of God, so Moses now sings: The Lord is become my salvation and His right hand has become glorious in power. God was already their salvation and power has always belonged to God, but now Israel vividly REALIZESit.	
1187###				2)They saw for themselves what THEY MUST DO.	
1188###				Faith and Commitment go hand in hand	
1189###				"I will sing unto the Lord" - "I will prepare Him an habitation"	
1190###				3)They saw for themselves WHAT GOD CAN DO - WILL DO.	
1191###				"He hath…" (triumphed, cast, dashed, guided, bring them in, etc.)	
1192###				"He shall" v.14-18 (melt, bring them in, reign forever and ever, etc.)	
1193###				c)This song followed by dancing was absolutely proper.	
1194###				Moses"elevated praise and Miriam"s holy dance were the only proper responses. God had triumphed gloriously, cast into the sea, dashed in pieces,displayed the greatness of His excellency, consumed them as stubble,caused the floods to stand upright as a heap with the breath of His nostril,and the enemy was stopped dead in his tracks. THIS WAS AN EXCEPTIONALDAY worthy of an exceptional song and outward expression of honor and thanksgiving to God.	
1195###				Exodus15:20-21--And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphedgloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.	
1196###				2The Scope of the Miracle	
1197###				a)ISRAEL"SFAITH WAS STRENGTHENED	
1198###				"the Lord is my strength and song" v.2	
1199###				b)EGYPT"SHOSTS WERE DESTROYED	
1200###				"dashed in pieces the enemy" v.6	
1201###				c)NATURE"SPOWER WAS SUBMITTED	
1202###				"Congealed the Waters"(v.8; Job 10:10; Zep 1:12; Zec 14:6)	
1203###				d)CANAAN"S HEARTS WERE CONQUERED	
1204###				"Fear and dread shall fall upon them" v.16	
1205###				The Significance of the Miracle	
1206###				a)God is and always will be on His throne!	
1207###				"The Lord shall reign forever and ever." v.18	
1208###				The Lord will DO IT AGAIN! Because he delivered that day, they could know that God would deliver and be the salvation of His people ALWAYS. The fact that they served the living and only true God and that He is the one in control of all thingswas the greatest assurance of safety and success.	
1209###				b)The enemy was STOPPED and can no longer pursue!	
1210###				"…Pharaoh went…with his horsemen into the sea…" v.19	
1211###				Pharaoh recanted his decision to liberate the Hebrews and tried to haul them back in chains. God saw to it that this would never happen. God destroyed Pharaoh and the hearts of the Egyptians were conquered. Egypt had no claim on the Hebrewsanymore.	
1212###				c)The people of God WENT ON and, can now possess their inheritance!	
1213###				"Israel went on dry land" v.19	
1214###				C.From the Red Sea to the Foot of Mount Sinai	
1215###				No Water in the Wilderness of Shur (15:22)	
1216###				Exodus 15:22--SoMoses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness ofShur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 	
1217###				Shur was a city on the north-eastern border of Egypt that was close to the location of modern Suez and it is alsothe name of its adjoining desert that stretches toward Canaan. The name Shurmeans "wall or that which limits" and was probably the last Arabiantown before entering Egypt.	
1218###				It is mentioned elsewhere inScripture: Hagar"s Flight (Gen 16:7) Abraham dwelled between Kadesh and Shur(Gen. 20:1) and in Genesis 25:18; I Samuel 15:7; 27:8. It is also called"Etham" in Exodus 13:20 and Numbers 33:6-8; 	
1219###				Bitter Water in Marah (15:23-26)	
1220###				Israel"s condition of having no water in the wilderness of Shur was magnified by the discovery of water that was undrinkable. Marah means bitter.	
1221###				Israel responds by murmuring for the second time since leaving Egypt (14:11,12) and continues a habit of complaining and murmuring when faced with an obstacle. This was part of the"slave mentality" that God designed to work out of them in the wildernessbefore bringing them into their inheritance. They had been slaves accustomed todefeat and mistreatment for so long, God had to teach them that they couldovercome and be victors in the face of difficulty.	
1222###				The miracle that occurs here is mysteriously suggestive of the cross of Christ. Moses casts a TREE into the waters which are sweetened and then God gives a mighty promise directly relatedto the sufferings of Christ on the cross.	
1223###				v. 26 … I will put none of these diseases upon thee, …:  for I am the LORD that healeth thee	
1224###				Isaiah 53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was  bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and  with his stripes we are healed.	
1225###				Twelve Wells of Water in Elim (15:27)	
1226###				… where wereutwelve wells of water, and uthreescore and ten palm trees:..	
1227###				It is amazingly apparent by the discovery at Elim that God is purposefully and sovereignly teaching Israel to trust Him. God knew what is was deep in their hearts despite all the singingand dancing after the Red Sea crossing. Immediately following that mountaintopexperience he leads them into a place with no water and then a place with waterthat cannot be drunk. After miraculously cleansing those waters, Godprovidentially brings them to an oasis bursting with water. This was as if tosay, "My children, whether there is no water or the water is too bitter todrink or there is clean water in abundance, I am your first need and you cantrust Me!"	
1228###				The numbers 12 and 70 suggest something to us of Divine order and government and Divine providence. They remind us of the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 Apostles, the 70 years of a man"slife (Psalm 90:10), 70 days the Egyptians mourned Jacob"s death, the 70 yearsof the Babylonian captivity, Daniel"s 70 weeks of years, the 70 members of theSanhedrin, and the seventy disciples Christ sent out in Luke 10:1.

1294###				1Purpose - Pattern of the Tabernacle (CH. 25-27, 30-31, 36-39)	
1295###				Moses vowed in his song in Exodus15: "I will prepare you a habitation." God"s instruction on Mount Sinai concerning the tabernacle had not been given yet, but Moses appears to havereceived some insight beforehand. The tabernacle of God is first in the heartsof His people. The purpose of the tabernacle was to give God an earthly vesselin which to dwell. The tabernacle itself is a type of Christ and a pattern ofthe life of the Believer.	
1296###				Materials for the Tabernacle came from the Free-will Offerings of the people.	
1297###				Exodus 25:2--Speak unto the children of Israel,that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.	
1298###				God himself designed the tabernacle and set its pattern

1353###				LEVITICUS: Access to God	
1354###				INTRODUCTION	
1355###				Leviticus--TheName	
1356###				Levi was the third son of Jacob (Gen.29:34) and more importantly the tribe which produced Aaron (Ex.4:14) the first High Priest after the Levitical Priesthood. The priesthood and sacrifices, although, did not begin with Aaron(Heb. 7:11).When the Israelites left Egypt, the ancient manner of worship was stillobserved by them, the eldest son of each house inheriting the priest's office,but this change was made at Mount Sinai conferring upon Aaron and his sons this office.<a href='#endNotes' >[15]</a>	
1357###				And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office….--Ex. 28:1	
1358###				The Hebrews refer to this book as"The Priest"s Law " <a href='#endNotes' >[16]</a>.The book of Hebrews is the source for the Vulgate title of this book and is its best commentary1:	
1359###				If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,)what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order ofMelchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? –Heb.  7:11; Ps. 110:4	
1360###				NOTE: Paul is establishing  the paramount conclusion that as important as the Law and specifically the priesthood of the Old Testament was, it was not established byGod as the end of His Divine purpose, but a building block and lesson preparingthe way for a more perfect system of communing with God. Heb. 9:11; 10:1	
1361###				Leviticus--TheSetting	
1362###				This book is generally held to be the work of Moses, though he was probably assisted by Aaron.  Its date is B. C.1490.  It contains the history of the first month of their second year afterleaving Egypt.sup1	
1363###				Moses and the People Finished the Tabernacle Ex. 40:33	
1364###				The Glory of the Lord Filled the Tabernacle  Ex. 40:34-38	
1365###				The LordSpoke to Moses out of the Tabernacle     Lev. 1:1	
1366###				Sacrifice and Separation – 1:1-7:38	
1367###				The AmazingGrace of Substitutional Sacrifice	
1368###				The reaches of God's grace extend far beyond what the human mind can understand. We are speechless and amazed at the grace and mercy of God. There is no human effort that could be even closelycompared to God"s actions of love toward his people. All humanity was guilty ofthe greatest treason against God and yet Christ has positioned himself as oursin bearer and substitute! God has made provision so that the enemy can bebecome friend, the slave can be become a servant of love, and the outcast canbecome a beloved member of the family. 	
1369###				A student of the Bible and humanity must be puzzled with the same question as Nicodemus in John 3:9:	
1370###				HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE?	
1371###				 "Approved Unto God" (II Tim. 2:15)	
1372###				"Peace with God" (Rom. 5:1)	
1373###				"Come boldly unto the throne of grace" (Heb. 4:16)	
1374###				"Friend of God" (James 2:23)	
1375###				"Be with Me [Jesus]" (Luke 23:43)	
1376###				"Be Ye Holy" (Lev. 20:7)	
1377###				B.The Purpose of the Old Testament Sacrifices	
1378###				It is absolutely imperative that it be established in our minds that the redemption and justification of mankind is possible only through the ublood of Jesus. 	
1379###				Hebrews 9:12-14--Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if theblood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean,sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall uthe blood ofChrist, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God,purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	
1380###				In light of Christ's sacrifice on the cross, the "bloody" book of Leviticus comes alive with relevance. Leviticus is not outdated because of Christ"s death, but stillserves the same purpose as it did before His death. The purpose of thesacrifices of Leviticus and the sum of the Old Testament is to point to Christ.The law is a school master that makes clear definition of right, wrong, andremedy. As we look into this great study of Leviticus, keep in mind that eachsacrifice, feast, and ordinance given by God is a portrait of Christ and hisdealings with mankind.	
1381###				(Whole) Burnt Offering, ch. 1	
1382###				Acceptable Value Determined by "Pay Grade": herd flock fowl, vs.1,2 The principle is established here early on that God will not require an IMPOSSIBLE thing of his people. Theofferings and sacrifices were regulated according to a person"s ability andmeans. If a man was rich, he was certainly capable of a burnt offering of theherd, but a man of small means might find it a great sacrifice to part withmerely the value of a fowl.

1411###				TrespassOffering, ch. 5-6:7	
1412###				Difference between the Sin Offering and the Trespass Offering, 5:1-6	
1413###				The sin offering atoned for the offender, whereas, the trespass offering atoned only for a specific trespass.The sin offering can be considered as "general redemption" and the "trespassoffering" can be considered a "ransom" for a particular wrong. This provisionmostly involves those sins committed in ignorance. The Trespass Offering is asubclass of the Sin offering. The sin offering was presented at feast days anddone corporately, whereas trespass offerings were not and were morespontaneous.

1428###				PeaceOfferings Regulated, 7:11-34	
1429###				Conclusion- Summary, 7:35-38	
1430###				 7:35--uThisis the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons,out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office;	
1431###				7:37--This is the  law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations,and of the sacrifice of the upeace offerings;	
1432###				TheSeparation of the People of God	
1433###				God"s people were expected to keep the law of God and live lies free of sin. But, a remedy was in place in the event the law was broken. This remedy ultimately is the atoning blood of Jesusbut initially was the sacrifice of animals (beginning back in the garden ofEden) which points toward Christ"s ultimate sacrifice.	
1434###				The priests were to live separate in order to function in their priestly duties. Their very approval into the ministry required an implicit dedication and consecration to God.	
1435###				In 7:37, the "consecrations"were the sacrifices and offerings which involved the dedication to God's service. The word "consecrations" literally means "a filling up, or filling ofthe hands." In Exodus 29:2, eil milluim , means the ram of filling up.	
1436###				A persons hands were filled with an offering to present to God, when they were dedicated to God. The word consecration signifies the filling up or filling the hands. These class ofofferings were not only for atonement but were also a means for approachingGod. (The same principal is loosely paralleled in Esther 4:11.)	
1437###				The Priest	
1438###				TheWitness of the Levites:	
1439###				Was on the Lord's Side in midst of Korah's rebellion. Ex 32:26	
1440###				Was armed in joining David at Hebron. I Chr. 12:23,27,28	
1441###				"Caused the people to understand the law" Neh. 8:6-8	
1442###				The Preparation of the Priesthood – Chapter 8	
1443###				This chapter gives us an account of the solemn consecration of Aaron and his sons to the priest's office.<a href='#endNotes' >[17]</a>	
1444###				It was done publicly, and the congregation was called together to be witnesses of it, Lev. 8:1-4. 	
1445###				It was done exactly according to God's appointment, Le 8:5. 	
1446###				 Verses 1-30	
1447###				They were washed and dressed, 6-9, 13. 	
1448###				The tabernacle, utensils and priests were anointed, 10-12. 	
1449###				A sin-offering was offered for them, 14-17. 	
1450###				A burnt-offering, 18-21. 	
1451###				The ram of consecration, 22-30. 	
1452###				The continuance of this solemnity for seven days, 31.	
1453###				Verses 31-36	
1454###				Moses, having done his part of the ceremony, now leaves Aaron and his sons to do theirs. 	
1455###				They must boil the flesh of their peace offering, and eat it in the court of the tabernacle, and the remains were burnt with fire, Lev 8:31-32.

1643###				INTRODUCTION TO NUMBERS	
1644###				Remember, the Bible is first a spiritualBook. No matter what section of the Holy Scripture we study its highest concernwill always be a spiritual one. 	
1645###				The  Bible is useful for business,reliable for history, and a fascinating read, but every precept laid out andrecorded account reveals a spiritual lesson: 	
1646###				-1Genesis" creation is an elaborate revelation of salvation. Christ speaks life and light into our chaos and creates new life.	
1647###				-2The Hebrew Exodus parallels spiritual deliverance from the bonds of sin and this world.	
1648###				-3InNumbers, the Israelites" journey through the wilderness provokes thought concerning the spiritual themes of full reliance upon God and the life livedwalking in the Spirit. Numbers especially illustrates sanctification which aseparation from E	
1649###				To the spiritual mind, a study of the O.T. law is quickening and provocative, but the carnal mind might find it lackluster.	
1650###				ICorinthians2:14-16--But the natural man receiveth not the things of theSpirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he that is spiritual judgeth allthings, yet he himself is judged of no man. 16 For who hath known the mind ofthe Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.	
1651###				The study of the offerings and priesthood is insightfully rich in teaching us how to approach a holy God andour service to Him. The blood of goats point to the Savior Jesus Christ and theinstruction of Moses is council from the ALMIGHTY GOD.	
1652###				Do not study the Bible merely intellectually as a scholar, but devour the spirit of Its message heartily!	
1653###				2 Corintians3:6-8--Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.7 But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, wasglorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the faceof Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: 8How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?	
1654###				The thirty-six chapters of Numbers journal the details of a spiritual pilgrimage. It is a spiritual journal of spiritual journey toward a spiritual inheritance.

1707###				This total does not agree with the particulars; for theGershonites were 7,500, the Kohathites 8,600, the Merarites 6,200, total22,300.  Several methods of solving this difficulty have been proposed bylearned men; Dr. Kennicott's is the most simple.  Formerly the numbers in theHebrew Bible were expressed by letters, and not by words at full length; and iftwo nearly similar letters were mistaken for each other, many errors in the numbers must be the consequence. Now it is probable that an error has creptinto the number of the Gershonites, Nu 3:22, where, instead of 7,500, we shouldread 7,200, as K caph, 500, might have been easily mistaken for r resh, 200,especially if the down stroke of the caph had been a little shorter thanordinary, which is often the case in MSS.  The extra 300 being taken off, thetotal is just 22,000, as mentioned in the 39th verse.

1823###				Numbers19:2 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORDhath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring theea red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never cameyoke:	
1824###				This chapter is only concerning the preparing and using of the ashes which were to infuse the water of purification. The people had complained of the strictness of the law, whichforbade their near approach to the tabernacle, 	
1825###				Num. 17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?	
1826###				In answer to this complaint, they are here directed to purify themselves, so as that they might come as far as they had occasion without fear.  	
1827###				I. The method of preparing these ashes, by the burning of a red heifer, with a great deal of ceremony, Nu 19:1-10. 	
1828###				II. The way of using them.	
1829###				1. They were designed to purify persons from the pollution contracted by a dead body, Nu 19:11-16. 	
1830###				2. They were to be put into running water (a small quantity of them), with which the person to be cleansed must be purified, Nu 19:17-22. And that this ceremonial purification was a type andfigure of the cleansing of the consciences of believers from the pollutions ofsin appears by the apostle's discourse, (Heb 9:13,14), where he compares theefficacy of the blood of Christ with the sanctifying virtue that was in"the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean." 	
1831###				In Numbers 19:1-10, We have here the divine appointment concerning the solemn burning of a red heifer to ashes,and the preserving of the ashes, that of them might be made, not a beautifying,but a purifying, water, for that was the utmost the law reached to; it offerednot to adorn as the gospel does, but to cleanse only. This burning of theheifer, though it was not properly a sacrifice of atonement for wrong done, being not performed at the altar, yet was typical of thedeath and sufferings of Christ, by which he intended, not only to satisfy God'sjustice, but to purify and pacify our consciences, that we may have peace withGod and also peace in our own bosoms, to prepare for which Christ died, notonly like the bulls and goats at the altar, but like the heifer without thecamp.  	
1832###				I.There was a great deal of care employed in the choice of the heifer that was to be burnt, much more than in the choice of any other offering, 	
1833###				Num. 19:2 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORDhath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring the red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never cameyoke:	
1834###				a.It must not only be without blemish, typifying the spotless purity and sinless perfection of the Lord Jesus,	
1835###				b.It must be a red heifer, because of the rarity of the colour, that it might be the more remarkable: the Jews say,  	
1836###				"If but two hairs were black or white, it was unlawful."	
1837###				Christ, as man, was the Son of Adam, red earth, and we find him red in his apparel, red with his own blood, and red with the blood of his enemies. 	
1838###				c.It must be one on which never came yoke, which was not insisted on in other sacrifices, but thus was typified the voluntary offer of the Lord Jesus, when he said, Lo, I come, He was bound and held with no other cords than those ofhis own love. This heifer was to be provided at the expense of thecongregation, because they were all to have a joint interest in it; and so all believers have in Christ. 	
1839###				II.There was to be a great deal of ceremony in the burning of it.  The care of doing it was committed to Eleazar, not to Aaron himself, because it was notfit that he should do anything to render himself ceremonially unclean, no, notso much as till the evening Num. 19:3;:Num. 19:8; yet it being an affair ofgreat concern especially in the significancy of it, it was to be performed by him that was next to Aaron in dignity.  The chief priests of that time had the principal hand in the death of Christ. 	
1840###				1. The heifer was to be slain without the camp, as an impure thing, which identifies the insufficiency of the methods prescribed by the ceremonial law to take away sin. So far were they from cleansing effectually that they were themselvesunclean; as if the pollution that was laid upon them continued to cleave tothem.  Yet, to answer this type, our Lord Jesus, being made sin and a curse for us, suffered without the gate, Heb 13:12. 	
1841###				2. Eleazar was to sprinkle the blood directly before the door of the tabernacle, and looking steadfastly towards it, 	
1842###				Nu 19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:	
1843###				This made it in some sort an expiation; for the sprinkling of the blood before the Lord was the chief solemnity in all the sacrifices of atonement; therefore, though this was not done at the altar, yet, being donetowards the sanctuary, it was closely relatedthat the virtue and validity of it depended upon the sanctuary, and werederived from it. This signified the satisfaction that was made to God by the death of Christ, our great high priest, who by the eternal Spirit (and theSpirit is called the finger of God, (Luke 11:20) offered himself without spotunto God; directly before the sanctuary, when he said, Father, into thy hands Icommit my spirit.  It also signifies how necessary it was to the purifying ofour hearts that satisfaction should be made to divine justice. This sprinklingof the blood put virtue into the ashes. 	
1844###				3. The heifer was to be wholly burnt, Nu 19:5. This typified the extreme sufferings of our Lord Jesus, both in soul and body, as a sacrifice made by fire. The priest was to cast into thefire, while it was burning, cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet, which were used inthe cleansing of lepers (Le 14:6,7), that the ashes of these might be mingledwith the ashes of the heifer, because they were designed for purification. 	
1845###				4. The ashes of the heifer(separated as well as they could from the ashes of the wood wherewith it was burnt) were to be carefully gathered up by the hand of a clean person, andpounded and sifted, and so laid up for the use of the congregation, (Nu 19:9),not only for that generation, but for posterity; for the ashes of this oneheifer were sufficient to season as many vessels of water as the people ofIsrael would need for many ages. The Jews say that this one served till the captivity, nearly 1000 years, and that there was never another heifer burnttill Ezra's time, after their return, grounded only upon the silence of theirold records in the later times of their church, of which they had more fullrecords, they find eight burnt between Ezra's time and the destruction of thesecond temple, which was about 500 years, These ashes are said to be laid uphere as a purification for sin, because, though they were intended to purifyonly from ceremonial uncleanness, yet they were a type of that purification forsin which our Lord Jesus made by his death. Ashes mixed with water are used inscouring, but these had their virtue purely from the divine institution, andtheir accomplishment and perfection in Christ, who is the end of this law forrighteousness. 	
1846###				a. That the water of purification was made so by the ashes of a heifer, whose blood was sprinkled before the sanctuary; so that which cleanses our consciences is the abiding virtue of thedeath of Christ; it is his blood that cleanses from all sin, 1Jo 1:7. 	
1847###				b.. That the ashes were sufficient for all the people.  There needed not to be a fresh heifer slain for every person or family that had occasion to be purified, but this one was enough forall, even for the strangers that sojourned among them (Nu 19:10); so there isvirtue enough in the blood of Christ for all that repent and believe thegospel, for every Israelite, and not for their sins only, but for the sins of the whole world, 1Jo 2:2. 	
1848###				c. That these ashes were capable of being preserved without waste to many ages. No bodily substance is so incorruptible as ashes are, these a very fit emblem of the everlasting efficacyof the sacrifice of Christ. He is able to save, and able to cleanse, to theuttermost.  	
1849###				d. These ashes were laid up as a stock or treasure, for the constant purification of Israel from their pollutions; so the blood of Christ is laid up for us in the word as an inexhaustible fountain of merit, to which by faith we may have recourse dailyfor the purging of our consciences; see Zec 13:1. 	
1850###				e. All those that were employed in this service were made ceremonially unclean by it; even Eleazar himself, though he did but sprinkle the blood, Nu 19:7. He that burned the heifer was unclean(Nu 19:8), and he that gathered up the ashes (Nu 19:10); so all that had a handin putting Christ to death contracted guilt by it: his betrayer, hisprosecutors, his judge, his executioner, all did what they did with wicked hands, though it was by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God (Ac2:23); yet some of them were, and all might have been cleansed by the virtue ofthat same blood which they had brought themselves under the guilt of. Some makethis to signify the imperfection of the legal services, and their insufficiencyto take away sin, inasmuch as those who prepared for the purifying of otherswere themselves polluted by the preparation. The Jews say, This is a mysterywhich Solomon himself did not understand, that the same thing should pollutethose that were clean and purify those that were unclean. 	
1851###				II Cor. 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

1856###				Adam Clarke's Commentary: 	
1857###				[The book of the wars of the Lord]  There are endless conjectures about this book, both among ancients and moderns.  Dr. Lightfoot'sopinion is the most simple, and to me bears the greatest appearance of beingthe true one.  "This book seems to have been some book of remembrances anddirections, written by Moses for Joshua's private instruction for the managementof the wars after him.  See Ex 17:14-16.  It may be that this was the same book which is called the book of Jasher, i. e., the book of the upright, or a directory for Joshua, from Moses, what to do and what to expect in his wars;and in this book it seems as if Moses directed the setting up of archery, see2Sa 1:18, and warrants Joshua to command the sun, and expect its obedience, Jos10:13."

1860###				Cities of Refuge	
1861###				Numbers 35:6-34; Joshua20:1-9	
1862###				The idea of providing cities of refuge (Joshua 20:1-9) for capital offenses is rooted in the tension between customary tribal law (retaliation or revenge, in which the blood relative isobligated to execute vengeance) and civil law (carried out less personally byan assembly according to a standard code of justice).	
1863###				Blood feuds are usually associated with nomadic groups;legal procedures, with villages and towns. Israel, found it necessary to adoptan intermediate step regulating manslaughter, so that an innocent person wouldnot be killed before standing trial. Absolution was possible only by beingcleared by his hometown assembly, and by the eventual death of the high priest,which freed the offender from ritual pollution.
