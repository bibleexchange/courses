<h1>Sura ya 2:Yeye ni mwana wa AdamuChapter 2: He is the Son of Man</h1>
<p>Katika sura ya kwanza tunaona Uungu wa Yesu kama ilivyoshuhudiwa na Yohana wote wawili,lakini lazima tukumbuke kwamba wakati yeye akiwa Mungu kamili vilevile yeye ni Mtu kamili.Yeye sio mwana wa Mungu tu,bali pia ni mwana wa Adamu.Sura ya pili ya Yohana inakuza ukweli huu kama tunavyoona Yesu akitoa sauti kwenye harusi,akiingiliana na mama yake,wakishiriki katika Pasaka,na kuonyesha msisimko wa kibinadamu wa hasira.In chapter one we see the Divinity of Jesus as witnessed by both Johns, but we must remember that while He was very much God that He was also very much man. He is not only the Son of God, but He is also the Son of Man. The second chapter of John magnifies this fact as we see Jesus mingle at a wedding, interact with His mother, participate in the Passover, and show the human emotion of anger.</p>

<h2>Harusi huko KanaThe Wedding at Cana 2:1-11</h2>
<h3>OmbiThe Request 2:1-3</h3>
<p>Kama siku tatu baada ya Yesu kuongea na Natanael au siku tatu baada ya Yesu kuingia Galilaya Yeye na wanafunzi wake walikuwa wamealikwa kwenye karamu ya harusi huko Kana.Kana(modern Kefr Kenna) ulikuwa mji mdogo takribani maili sita kaskazini mwa Nazareti katika kabila la Asheri(Yosh. 19:28).Maelezo ya Galilaya yalitumiwa kutofautisha hiyo kutoka Kana nyingine,ambayo ilikuwa ni ilikuwa ni kabila ya Efraimu,katika Nchi ya Samaria(Yosh. 16:8; 17:9).</p>
 Either three days after Jesus talked to Nathanael or three days after Jesus had entered Galilee He and His disciples were invited to a wedding feast in Cana. Cana (modern Kefr Kenna) was a small town about six miles northeast of Nazareth in the tribe of Asher (Josh. 19:28). The description ‚Äúof Galilee‚Äù was used to distinguish it from another Cana, which was in the tribe of Ephraim, in the Samaritan country (Josh. 16:8; 17:9).</p>
<p>Along with Jesus and His disciples, there was present Mary, the mother of Jesus. It is quite probable that one of the married couple was closely related to Jesus and His mother and that is why they were both present at the feast.</p>
<p>Shida iliinuka katika sikukuu waliishiwa divai,ama kwa sababu ya mipango duni au kwasabau ya wageni wengi waliokuwa wamefika zaidi ya walivyokuwa wametazamia.Sasa bwanaharusi alikuwa katika hatari ya kutompendeza baba mkwe wake mpya aliyekuwa amempata(mkuu wa sikukuu)kwa huu upungufu wa mipango kwa upande wake na mama wa Yesu alisihi kusaidia shida hii.A problem arose at this feast‚Äîthey ran out of wine, either because of a lack of planning or because more guests had arrived than had been expected. Now the bridegroom was in danger of displeasing his newly acquired father-in-law (the ruler of the feast) by this lack of planning on his part and the mother of Jesus sought to help the situation.</p>
<p>‚ÄHawana divai,alimwambia mwanaye.Kabla ya kipindi hiki yeye alikuwa bado hajawahi kumuona akitenda muujiza na kwa hiyo ilikuwa ni ushahidi kwamba yeye kwa kuthibitisha aliamini kwamba yeye hakuwa mtu wakawaida na yeye alikuwa na nguvu hata ingawa alikuwa bado hajaidhihirisha bado.They have no wine,‚Äù she said to her Son. Before this time she had never seen Him perform a miracle and so it was evident that she firmly believed that He was not a normal man and that He had supernatural power even though He had not revealed it yet.</p>
<h3>MwitikioThe Response 2:4-8</h3>
<p>‚ÄúMwanamke,nina nini nawe?saa yangu bado haijawadia.Yesu sio kwamba alikuwa anamdhalilisha au kumvunjia heshima;yeye kirahisi alikuwa anamwonyesha Mariamu na wengine waliomzunguka hiyo ingawa alikuwa mwana wa Mungu,ilikuwa sio wakati wake kutukuzwa.Hakuja katika dunia kwa kusudi hili la hitaji la kimwili la mwanadamu,bali saa yake ingefika wakati alipokutana na hitaji la kiroho la mwanadamu msalabani(Yohn 17:1). Hata ingawa haikuwa kusudi lake la kumsaidia mtu kimwili wala hakuwa lazimika kwa bwana harusi au kwa wakilishi waliofika kusadia shida hii,tunaona utu wake kadiri anavyoonyesha huruma kwa ajili ya huruma kwa ajili ya bwana harusi na kuonyesha kujali ombi kutoka kwa mama yake na kuendelea kufanya muujiza.Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.‚Äù Jesus was not being impudent or disrespectful; He was simply showing her and those around Him that although He was the Son of God, it was not His time to be glorified. He did not come to earth for this purpose of meeting man‚Äôs physical need, but His ‚Äúhour‚Äù would come when He would meet man‚Äôs spiritual need on the cross (John 17:1). Even though it was not His purpose to physically help man and neither did He owe it to the bridegroom or any of the others present to assist in the situation, we see His humanity as He shows compassion for this bridegroom and respect to the request of His mother and He proceeds to perform a miracle.
Mariamu aonyesha ujasiri kwa mwanawe kwa kuwatia moyo watumishi kufanya chochote anachowambia.Siku hiyo hawakuwa na divai,bali walikuwa na msimamo mzuri,utii,na mioyo ya hiari na wakati haya yakichanganyika na nguvu ya Mungu mambo makuu yatatokea.Utii siku zote ni shughuli ya kuamini,ingawa yeye kwa ujumla hashikilii sababu kwa ajili ya amri za kristo(Mwanzo. 41:55).</Mary shows confidence in her Son by encouraging the servants to do whatsoever He may command. That day they did not have wine, but they did have good attitudes, obedience, and willing hearts and when those ingredients are mixed with the power of God great things will happen. Obedience to Christ is always the believer‚Äôs duty, even though he does not totally comprehend the reasons for Christ‚Äôs commands (Gen. 41:55).</p>

	<h1>#1 Bwana wa uboraMaster of Quality</h1>

	Kwenye harusi huko Kana Yesu aligeuza maji kuwa divai kwa kufanya hivyo alikuwa na uwezo wa kuchukuwa kile ambacho hakikutakiwa(maji) na kuyafanya kuwaw kitu kinachohitajiwa(divai).Kwa kuona ishara wanafunzi waliamini kwamba angeweza kufanya kitu kizuri kutokana na kitu chochote kilichokuwa kimeharibiwa na dhambi.At the wedding of Cana Jesus turned water into wine proving that He had the ability to take that which was unwanted (water) and make it something that was wanted (wine). At seeing the sign the disciples believed that He could make something good out of anything that was destroyed by sin.

<p>Yesu aliwaambia kujaza maji kwenye mitungi sita ya mawe.Mitungi hii ilikuwa hutumika kwa ajili ya utakaso wa Wayahudi,ambayo hurejea kwenye desturi yao tata ya kunawa mikono yao kabla ya kula(Mark 7:1-5), Ambayo inajulikana kama Netilat yadayim.Kwa kutumia mkono wa kushoto maji yangeweza kuchukuliwa kutoka inje ya mtungi kwa kutumia chombo kidogo na kumwagwa kwa mkono wa kulia kwanza(kwa kuwa mkono wa kulia umefirikiwa kuwa ni wa muhimu katika dini ya kiyahudi) kisha wangechukuwa kitu kwa mkono wa kulia na kusafisha mkono wa kushoto.Haisitahili kwa wayahudi wa leo kuosha mikono yao kabla ya kufanya Netilat yadayim  kwa sababu kusudi sio kuosha mikono bali zaidi ya hapo ni kuwatakasa.Mitungi hii ambayo imekuwa kwa sehemu angalau kama kutoingia mtupu kwenye ibada za kidini ambayo sasa walikuwa wamejazwa ilikutimiza utii wa mapenzi ya Mungu.</p>Jesus told them to fill the six stone pots with water. These pots were used for the purification of the Jews, which is referring to their complex custom of washing their hands before eating (Mark 7:1-5), Which is known as Netilat yadayim  Using the left hand water would be taken out of the pot with a smaller vessel and poured over the right hand first (because the right hand has precedence in the Jewish religion) then they would take the vessel in the right hand and clean the left hand. It is noteworthy that modern Jews wash their hands before performing Netilat yadayim because the purpose is not to wash the hands, but rather to purify them. These pots that had been at least partially if not entirely empty from religious rituals were now they were being refilled to fulfill obedience of the divine will.</p>

<h3>MatokeoThe Results 2:9-11</h3>
<h4>Maji yalifanywa kuwa divaiThe water was made wine</h4>
<p>Baada ya mitungi kujazwa,Yesu aliwaambia watumishi wachote na kumpelekea mkuu wa karamu.Hakuna onyesho kwenye maandiko ambacho kitufulani maalumu kilichotokea kama ilivyokuwa kwa hiyo kadiri watumishi hawa walivyoondoka kwa utii kuchota maji na kumpelekea baba mkwe, wao pia walichukuwa hatua kubwa ya imani.Kuwaambia watu kutenda kabla ya matokeo kuonekana sio jambo geni kwa ajili ya Mungu,kwasababu tunamwona Yeye akimwambia Yoshua awambie makuhani kuchukuwa hatua kwenye mto Yoridani kabla ya mto kukauka(Yosh. 3:8, 13)na Yesu aliwambia wenye ukoma kumi kuwaambia makuhani kwamba wao walikuwa tayari wametakaswa wakati walikuwa bado wanamakovu (Luke 17:14). Katika shida zote mbili ilikuwa bado tendo la utii lilikuwa limetendeka ilikusababisha miujiza kutokea;ukweli ni uleule katika Yohana mbili,lakini sio hakika kwa halisi wakati muujiza ulipotokea,bali ni hakika kwamba wakati mkuu wa karamu alipokunywa kile alicholetewa na watumishi alipoonja utamu wa zabibu na sio maji matupu.Kuna kilichoongezeka kwenye maji ambacho hakikuwepo kabla;nguvu ileile iliosema na iwe nuru ilioita vywanzo hivi kwenye miunganiko ya nyongeza kwa pamoja katika fumba na kufumbua ilitenda muujiza wa maji mara moja,lakini sasa ni divai nzuri.</p>After the pots were filled, Jesus then told the servants to ‚ÄúDraw out now, and bare unto the governor of the feast.‚Äù There is no indication in the Scripture that anything special had happened to the water as of yet, so as these servants moved in obedience to take the water to the new father-in-law they were also taking a big step of faith. Telling men to act before results are seen is not a strange thing for God, for we see Him tell Joshua to have the priests step into the Jordan River before it dried up (Josh. 3:8, 13) and Jesus told the ten lepers to go tell the priest that they had been cleansed while they still possessed the plague (Luke 17:14). In both situations it was not until the action of obedience had take place that the miracles occurred; the same is true here in John two, for it is not certain exactly when the miracle took place, but it is certain that when the ruler drank what the servants brought him that he tasted fresh grapes and not plain water. There has been added to the water that which was not there before; the same power that said, ‚ÄúLet there be light‚Äù called these elements and additional compounds together in a twinkling of an eye and performed the miracle of once water, but now is good wine.</p>
<h4>Mkuu alipendezwaThe ruler was pleased</h4>
<p>Mkuu wa karamu alijua vyanzo vyote vya karamu,lakini hii ilimshangaza.Alijuwa kuwa alikuwa hajawahi kuonja ubora wa divai hii kabla..</p>Lakini wewe ulikuwa umeweka divai nzuri hadi sasa.Hapa kuwa na jibu toka kwa bwana harusi lilikuwa limeandikwa baada ya maelezo yaliyo fanywa.Ukimya ulikuwa ni onyesho la kukubali kwake kwenye uhakika ambao ulikuwa ni divai nzuri.</p>.The governor of the feast knew all the resources of the feast, but this puzzled him. He knew that he had never tasted wine of this quality before.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut thou has kept the good wine until now.‚Äù There was no reply from the
bridegroom recorded after this statement was made. The silence was a good indication of his agreeing to the fact that it was good wine.</p>
<h4>Wanafunzi waliaminiThe disciples believed</h4>
<p>Tukio hili la kimiujiza la kugeuza maji kuwa divai lilikuwa mwanzo wa miujiza kwa ajili ya Yesu.Yesu hakuja kwenye harusi kuwa mtu wa ajabu,kujionyesha,kufanya mazingaumbwe,kudanganya,kuburudisha,au kusisimua watu waliofika,lakini jambo la Yesu kuwa pale lilikuwa ni kuchukuwa wanafunzi wake kwenye jambo dogo la nguvu yake kubwa ambayo anayo kwa ajili ya kukutana na dharura ambayo huweza kuinuka katika uzoefu wao wa baadaye.Kwasababu ya muujiza wanafunzi wake walimwamini;walikuwa tayari wameamini kwamba yeye ndiye wangepaswa  kumfuata,lakini sasa walikuwa wameamini kwamba yeye alikuwa na vyanzo visivyo na kikomo katika mpango wake walitambua kidogo kwamba yeye alikuwa mwana wa Mungu.This miraculous event of turning water into wine was the ‚Äúbeginning of miracles‚Äù for Jesus. Jesus did not come to the wedding to be romantic, put on a show, do magic, deceive, entertain, or excite the people present, but the object of Jesus being there was to convey to His disciples a little something of His vast power which He has for meeting any emergency that arises in their experiences ahead. Because of the miracle His disciples believed on Him; they had already believed He was the One that they should follow, but now they believed that He had unlimited resources at His disposal‚Äîthey realized a little more that He was the Son of God.</p>
<p>Hakuna habari ambayo kwamba kuna mwingine zaidi ya mitume alimwamini Yesu kwa sababu ya muujiza.Tunajua kwa mwenyeji ambayo alikuwa mkuu wa sherehe hakujuwa ni wapi divai imetoka na inawezekana kwamba hata bwana harusi hakujuwa pia, kwa hiyo hatamoja wao hakumwamini Yesu kwa sababu ya ule muujiza.Hiyo ndiyo shida ya dunia,kwa wachache wanaojua kwamba Mungu amefanya kazi kwenye maisha yao kwa ajili ya mema.There is no record that anyone else besides the disciples believed on Jesus because of the miracle. We know for certain that the ruler of the feast didn‚Äôt know where the wine had come from and it is very possible that the bridegroom didn‚Äôt know either, so neither one of them would have believed on Jesus because of the miracle. That is the problem with the world, so few recognize that it is God that has worked in their lives for the good.</p>
<h2>Kutaswa kwa hekaluThe Cleansing of the Temple 2:12-17</h2>
<p>Kwa kuendelea kutoka kana ya Galilaya tunaona Yesu akifanya mwonekano wake wakwanza ulioandikwa huko Yerusalemu tangu alipowachanganya wasomi kama kijana mdogoMoving on from Cana of Galilee we see Jesus make His first recorded appearance in Jerusalem since He confounded the doctors as a boy (Luke 2:41-51). Likizo yake kwa ajili ya kuweko kwake ilikuwa ni Pasaka,ambayo ilikuwa inasherehekewa kwa siku saba mara moja kila mwaka kutoka tar 15 hadi 21 ya mwezi wa Abibu(ambayo hulinganishwa na mwezi wetu wa Nne)kana kuwakilisha mwezi wa kwanza wa Kutoka kwa waisrael kama walivyokombolewa kutoka Misri.Kama mwana wa Adamu,ushiriki wa Yesu katika tukio hili halikuwa jambo la kigeni kwa kulingana na sheria kila mwanaume miongoni wa wayahudi alitakiwa kuonekana kwenye sherehe hiiThe occasion for His presence was the Passover, which was celebrated for seven days once every year from the 15th to the 21st of the month Abib (which corresponds to our April) and represents the first Exodus of the Israelites as they were delivered from Egypt. As the Son of Man, Jesus‚Äô participation in this event was not a strange thing for according to the Law every male among the Jews was required to appear at this feast (KumbDeut. 16:6).</p>
<p>Juu ya kuingia hekaluni,Yesu aona watu wakijaribu kufanya biashara kwa kulaghai shauku za watu wenye mioyo nusu nusu kwa ajili ya dini.Baadhi ya watu walikuwa wakiuza kondoo na ngo'mbe ambayo walikuwa wanahitajiwa kwa ajili ya kila mtu kutoa sadaka kama dhabihu,wakati watu wengine walikuwa wanabadilisha pesa za kigeni kutoka kwa mahujaji waliosafiri kutoka kokote Duniani walizibadilisha kwa nusu shekeli ya sarafu(shekeli kwa ajili ya ibada)ambayo ilitolewa sadaka kwa kuhani(Kutoka . 30:13); Upon entering the temple, Jesus sees men trying to make money by exploiting people‚Äôs half-hearted desire for religion. Some men were selling sheep and cattle that were required by every man to offer as a sacrifice, while other men were taking foreign money from pilgrims that had traveled from all over the world and exchanged it for a half-shekel of silver (the shekel of the sanctuary) that was offered to the priest ( Ex. 30:13); bila shaka wafanyabiashara hawa walitoza ada kwa ajili ya kubadilisha.Yusufu aliandika kwamba wanyama 256,500 walitolewa kila mwaka na ilikuwa yamkini karibia kiasi kilekile cha shekeli kilichotolewa kingekuwa faida kubwa kwa wale watu.</p> no doubt these merchants charged a fee for the exchange. Josephus recorded that 256,500 animals were offered yearly and there was probably close to the same amount of shekels given‚Äîthat would have been a large profit for these men.</p>

<div class="highlights left">
	<h1>#2Bwana wa nafsi Master of Souls</h1>
	<p>
	Yesu alionyesha mamlaka wakati alipowaamru wafanya biashara kuliacha hekalu.Inaonyesha yeye alikuwa na mamlaka ya kufanya hukumu juu ya nafsi za watu na kuamru kile ambacho wangepaswa kufanya.Kama wanafunzi walivyo ya kumbuka maneno ya Zabr 69:9, walitambua kwamba nguvu hii ilikuja kuatoka mbinguni na sio kiti cha enzi cha kidunia.waJesus showed authority when He commanded the merchants to leave the temple. It shows that He had the power to make judgment on men‚Äôs souls and command what they should do. As the disciples remembered the words of Psalm 69:9, they realized that this power came from Heaven and not any earthly throne.

</div>

<p>Mazoezi haya ya kuwalaza hawa wasafiri toka mbali sana hayakuwa mabaya, bali kile kilichokuwa kibaya ni kwamba walitumia nyumba takatifu ya Mungu kama mahalli pa mnada wa kawaida.Kwa wakati huo huo,upungufu wa watu kuja wakiwa wamejiandaa kwa ajili ya sherehe inaonyesha kwamba picha ya kidini kwa wakati huu ilikuwa mtindo pekee usiokuwa na wazo la kutoa dhabihu au wakifu uliohusishiwa.</p>These practices of accommodating travelers from off were not altogether wrong, but what was wrong was that they were using God‚Äôs Holy House as a common marketplace. At the same time, the people‚Äôs lack of coming prepared to the celebration shows how that the religious scene at this time was only one of formality where no real thought of sacrifice or ddication was involved.</p>
<p> Yesu alipowaona hawa watu hakusita kutoa hukumu walioisitahili.Alifanya mjeledi mdogo wa ngozi na kwa ghafla alivuruga vyombo vyao na kuwafukuza kutoka kwenye hekalu na kutangaza,toeni hivi vitu hapa!msifanye nyumba ya Baba yangu kuwa pango la wafanyibiashara!kunamashaka kidogo kwamba Yesu hapa alielezea msisimko wa kibinadamu wa hasira,ambayo sio dhambi kwa yenyewe kama yenyewe bila kuunganishwa na dhambi zingine(Ef. 4:26). Yesu hakufanya dhambi kwa kile alichokifanya,bali zaidi sana alikuwa katika kiini cha kukanusha dhambi kadiri alivyoondoka katika kusafisha hekalu siku hiyo.Mungu siku zote amehukumu dhambi,lakini mpaka kwenye alama hii tumeshaona kwamba imetekelezwa kutoka uhalisia wa mbinguni katika hali kama zile kama vile moto wa Sodoma na Gomora na mapigo huko Misri.Kwa hiyo sasa tunaona hukumu imetekelezwa kwa utofauti wa kipekee kama mwana wa Adamu angefanyahili Mungu alikuwa moja kwa moja kumwaadhibu mwanadamu kwa njia ya mikono ya mwili.hYWhen Jesus saw these men He did not hesitate to execute the judgment they deserved. He made a scourge of small cords and quickly disrupted their wares and expelled them from the temple as He declared, ‚ÄúTake these things hence! Make not my Father‚Äôs house a house of merchandise!‚Äù There is little doubt that Jesus here expressed the human emotion of anger, which is not a sin in itself as long as it is not coupled with other sins (Eph. 4:26). Jesus did not sin in what He did, but rather He was in essence refuting sin as He moved to cleanse the temple that day.
God had always judged sin, but until this point we had seen it executed from the realms of heaven as in such circumstances as the fire on Sodom and Gomorrah and the plagues on Egypt. Now we see judgment executed differently only as the Son of Man could do it‚ÄîGod was directly punishing man through the hands of flesh.</p>
<h2>Ishara ya ufufuoThe Sign of the Resurrection 2:18-25</h2>
<p>Mbele ya macho ya Yesu kuwa fukuza wafanyabiashara kutoka hekaluni wayahudi walishangazwa kwa ajili ya mamlaka ambayo Yesu aliionyesha na walitaka kujuwa kwanini yeye alikuwa na haki yakufanya vitu kama hivyo walitaka awaonyeshe ishara ya kuthibitisha kwamba yeye alitoka kwa Mungu.Yesu aliwapa ishara,lakini aliwapa kwa njia ya mfano,Livunjeni hekalu hili, na kwa siku tatu nitaliinua tena.Yesu alikuwa anaerejelea kwa mwili wake kusulubiwa na ufufuo.Wayahudi hawakuelewa hili na walidhani yeye alikuwa kiongelea kuhusu hekalu laa kimwili,ambayo walikanusha kwamba halingeweza kujengwa kwa siku tatu,kwakuwa lilichukuwa miaka arobaini na sita kujengwa kwa mara ya kwanza.Kutokuamini kwao katika ishara yake hakukupunguza uhalisia wake,kwa maana baada ya kufufuka wanafunzi wake walikumbuka na kutambua kile alicho kuwa ameongelea.</p>.At the sight of Jesus dispelling these merchants from the temple the Jews were amazed at the authority that Jesus displayed and they wanted to know why He had the right to do such a thing‚Äîthey wanted Him to give them a sign to prove that He was from God. Jesus gave them a sign, but He gave it in a parable, ‚ÄúDestroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.‚Äù Jesus was referring to His body as the temple and was referring to the crucifixion and resurrection. The Jews did not understand this and thought he was speaking of the physical temple, which they denied could be rebuilt in three days since it had taken forty-six years to erect originally. Their unbelief in His sign did not make it any less real, for after He had arose the disciples remembered it and realized what He had been talking about.</p>

<p>Ishara hii ilikuwa tofauti na ni ishara ya kiMungu ambayo waebrania waliipokea kwa wakati uliopita kwa kuwa haikutolewa na na nabii,malaika au mtu mwingine wa Mungu,lakini sasa huyo mwana wa Adamu alikuwa amekuja,Mungu alizungumza na mtu wa kwanza na yeye mwenyewe alitoa ishara.Hapa kuwa na mtu wa kati aliyehitajika,lakini Mungu alizungumza na mwanadamu ana kwa ana.</p>This sign was different then the divine signs that the Hebrews had received in the past for it was not given by a prophet, angel, or other oracle of God, but now that the Son of Man had come, God spoke in the first person and He Himself gave the sign. There was no middle man needed, but God spoke with man face to face.</p>
