<h1>Chapter 7: He is the Water of Life</h1>Sura ya 7:Yeye ni maji ya uzima.Wakati ulipofika wa sura ya saba ya yohana,karibia majimbo yote ya uyahudi yalikuwa yamesikia kuhusu yesu.Wakati Yesu alipokuwa akifanya miujiza mikubwa na kusema mambo ya kushangaza,wingi wa watu hawa waliamini yesu alikua ni kama mtume kutoka kwa mungu kama sio mesia yeye;kwa muda uleule, tangu Yesu alivyoukataa mfumo wa dini wa kiyahudi ambayo ilipigwa na kuchafuliwa, kulikuwa na makabiliano makubwa na mgawanyiko juu ya huyu mwana wa seremala. Tatizo lilikuwa hili, kwa akili ya kibinadamu huwezi kuelewa vitu vya kiMungu [warum 8:7; 1kor.2:11]. Wakati wowote mtu anapojaribu kutumia akili yake katika kufikiri mambo ya mbinguni, hujikuta katika kuchanganyikiwa zaidi kuliko uwazi. Hizo zilikuwa ni zabuni za Roho na moyo baada ya Mungu kupokea ufunuo kutoka juu na walijua hasa Yesu ni nani. Katika sura ya saba ya Yohana inadhihirisha vitu viwili: Watu walifikiri vipi kuhusu Yesu na Yesu mwenyewe alijitangazaje kuwa [maji yaliyo hai].   
<p>By the time we reach the seventh chapter of John, almost everyone in the Jewish provinces had heard about Jesus. Since Jesus had performed great miracles and said wonderful things, many of these people believed Jesus was at least a prophet from God if not the Messiah Himself; at the same time, since Jesus also disrupted the Jewish religious system that had become insipid and corrupted, there was much confrontation and division over this Son of the carpenter.</p>
<p>The problem was this, with his carnal mind man cannot understand the things of God (Romans 8:7; I Cor. 2:11). Whenever man tries in his own intellect to make sense of the things of heaven, he only results in causing confusion rather than clarity. Those that were tender to the Spirit and had a heart after God received revelation from above and they knew exactly who Jesus was.</p>Utu wa yesu ulihojiwa 7:1-13.Baada ya yesu kumponya mtu kilema katika siku ya sabato Wayahudi[hiyo ni,sio taifa lote la kiebrania,lakini uongozi wa dini za kiyahudi]walitaka kumuua Yesu[yohana 5:16] na walizidi kujawa na hasira wakati yesu alipokuwa akijitangaza kuwa yeye ni mwana wa Mungu[yohana 5:18];kwa sababu chuki ilionekana,kwa mara ya kwanza Yesu aliishi nje ya uyahudi, ambayo,kwa ujumla,  na hasahasa Yerusalemu. Yesu hakuogopa kufa, kwani alijua kuwa muda ukifika atakamatwa kwa kuteswa na kusulubiwa, lakini huu muda bado {Yoh. 7:6}. Pia, lazima yanukuliwe kuwa Andiko linasema haiwezekani na kamwe haitawezekana. Yesu alikuwa na nguvu kutoka kwa Mungu kuwapiga  au kuwashind maadui zake, hivyo angeweza kuingia Yerusalem bila tatizo lolote, lakini kwasababu yeye hakudhihirisha ile aina ya nguvu, alikuwa anafikiria mbeleni kwamba hatatumia muda mwingi katika mji mtakatifu.
<p>The seventh chapter of John reveals two things: what the people thought abut Jesus and what Jesus proclaimed Himself to be (the water of life).</p>
<h2>Jesus’ Person Questioned 7:1-13</h2>
<p>After Jesus had healed the lame man on the Sabbath day the Jews (that is, not the Hebrew nation as a whole, but the Jewish religious hierarchy) sought to kill Jesus (John 5:16) and they were even more angered when Jesus proclaimed that He was the Son of God (John 5:18); because of this known hatred, Jesus stayed primarily out of Jewry, which was, in general, Judea, and more specifically, Jerusalem. Jesus was not afraid of dying, for He knew that at one time He would submit to their persecution and execution, but this was not the “time” (John 7:6). Also, it must be noted that the Scripture says “would not” and not “could not.” Jesus had the power from God to hold back or defeat His enemies, so He could have entered Jerusalem without any problem, but because He did not manifest that type of power then, it was out of prudence that He did not spend much time in the Holy City.</p>
<h3>Waliulizana  ndugu zake 7:2-9 Questioned by His brothers 7:2-9</h3>
<p>Kwasababu ya hadhari hii, Yesu hakuchagua kuhudhuria siku kuu ya vibanda japokuwa ndugu zake walimhimiza kwenda. Hawa ndugu walikuwa ni watu wa ukoo wake kweli, tangu pale  walipomchangia Maria kama mama yao japo Yesu ni uzao wa Roho Mtakatifu na wengine ni uzao wa Yusufu. Hawa kaka zake angalau walikuwa wawili kama sio majina yote manne yaliyotajwa katika Mathayo 13:55 {Yakobo, Yusufu, Simoni, na Yuda}.  Because of this prudence, Jesus chose not to openly attend the Feast of the Tabernacles even though His brothers chided Him to go. These “brethren” were in truth His half-brothers, since they may have shared Mary as a mother but Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit while the others were born of Joseph. These brothers were at least two if not all four of the names listed in Matthew 13:55 (James, Joses, Simon, and Judas).</p>
<p>Ingawa hawa watu walikua pamoja na Yesu, walimsikiliza wakati akiongea, na ilionekana wazi anawaudhi kiroho, hawakumwamini bali ni mtu anayesemwa kuwa, ni Mwana wa Mungu. Sasa, katika kumdhihaki, walitaka Yeye aende Yerusalemu kwenye siku kuu na kutangaza Uungu wake. Yesu hakupata hamasa hii na kwa mkazo aliwaambia kwamba sio muda wake wa kujifunua na ndipo akawatia moyo waende kwenye sherehe pasipo Yeye. Although these men grew up with Jesus, heard Him speak, and were exposed to the Spirit He bore, they did not believe the He was the person that He claimed to be, the Son of God. Now, in form of jest, they wanted Him to go to Jerusalem for the feast and openly proclaim His deity. Jesus did not give in to this peer-pressure and firmly told them that it was not His time to be revealed and then He encouraged them to go to the ceremony without Him.</p>
<h3>Waliuliozana watu wa Yerusalem 7:10-13  Questioned by the people of Jerusalem 7:10-13</h3>
<p>Baada ya ndugu zake kumwacha kusini mwa Yerusalem, Yesu pia akaondoka kwenye siku kuu, lakini hakwenda waziwazi, bali kwa siri. Watu walikuwa na shauku kumwona Yesu kwenye siku kuu na walishakia kutoonekana kwake. After His brothers left southward for Jerusalem, Jesus also departed for the feast, but He did not go openly, but in secret. The people were eager to see Jesus at the feast and were perplexed when He did not show up.</p>
<p>Kulikuwa na hisia mchanganyiko za watu kuhusu mtu huyu, Yesu wa Galilaya. Baadhi walimwona kuwa ni mtu mwema. Walimwone akifanya kazi nzuri za kuponya na kulisha makutano kwa samaki wadogo wachache na vipande vya mikate; pia walisikia nguvu zake, bado alifundisha kwa kutuhurumia, na alikuwa anashawishi vitu kama vile vinatoka kwa  miungu watu. Japo alishawishi kwa sifa ya kibinadam, hakuhitimisha kwa kutambukisha Uungu wake.   There was mixed feelings among the people about this man, Jesus of Galilee. Some were insistent that He was a good man. They had seen Him do good works of healing and feed the multitude with the few small fish and loaves of bread; they also heard His powerful, yet compassionate teaching, and they were convinced that such things could only come from a godly person. Though they were convinced of His human virtue, they did not comprehend His divine identity.</p>
<p>Kulikuwa na wengine waliofikiri kuwa Yesu alikuwa anadanganya watu tu. Fikira zo kuu ni kwamba miujiza yake ilikuwa ni ungo tu na watu walijitokeza kujifanya ni wagonjwa ili yeye aonekane amewaponya. hapakuwepo na kundi lenye sauti ya mawzo ya faraja hadharani kwani walikuwa anaogopa viongozi wa dini ya kiyahudi watasema au watafanya nini kwake. There were others that thought that Jesus was only deceiving the people. They might have thought that His miracles were only illusions and that He had people pretend to be sick so that it would appear that He healed them. Neither group was comfortable voicing their opinions in public for they were afraid of what the Jewish religious leaders would have said or done to them.</p>
<h2 Walihojiana mafundisho ya Yesu 7;14-24  Jesus’ Doctrine Questioned 7:14-24</h2>
<h3>Waliulizana kwasababu ya upungufu wake wa elim 7:14-18  Questioned because of His lack of schooling 7:14-18</h3>
<p Siku kuu ilipofika katikati {Yawezekana siku ya nne au ya tano kati ya siku nane za siku kuu za sherehe} Yesu alifanya mwenyewe kujulikana kuwa zawadi ya sherehe alipoenda hekaluni na kuanza kufundisha watu. kama siku zote, maneno ya Yesu yalikuwa yamejawa busara na nguvu. Tendo hili lilisababisha watu kumuuliza Yeye na mafundisho yake kwa kufikiri kuwa yeye ni mwana wa kawaida wa seremala ambaye hakusoma, na bado anafundisha maneno makuu.  During the middle of the feast (probably the fourth or fifth day of the eight day ceremony) Jesus made Himself known to be present at the feast when He went to the temple and started teaching the people. As always, Jesus’ words were full of wisdom and power. This fact caused the people to question Him and His teaching for they thought Him to be the son of a simple carpenter that had never had a proper schooling, and yet He taught such great words.</p>
<p>Yesu aliwajibu na kuwaelezea yale mafundisho yake hakufundishwa kutoka kwa mtu, bali kutoka kwa Mungu. Hapakuwa na shaka kuwa wengi wa Wayahudi walikuwepo kwa maarifa makubwa ya maandiko kichwani, bado walikuwa na maarifa kdogo ya mapenzi na shauku ya Mungu. Kama wangeshika hili, ndipo wangemjua Yesu alikuwa nanik.  Jesus answered them and explained that His doctrine was not learned from man, but from God. There was no doubt that many of the Jews present had a great head-knowledge of the Scriptures, yet they had little heart-knowledge of God’s will and desire. If they had possessed this, then they would have known who Jesus was.</p>
<h3>Waliulizana kwasababu ya usawa wa maarifa 7:19-24  Questioned because of His precision of knowledge 7:19-24</h3>
<p>Walifikiri kuwa mtu husema kile anachokijua kwa kina ndani ni sahihi, ndipo wakamkiri yeye kuwa ni mtu mkuu halisi wa kweli. Ijapo mara tuu, kama ni asili ya mtu, tulimkatalia mmoja wetu aliyetumbia tunafanya makosa na tulikiri kwake alikuwa muongo japo tulijua kwamba alikuongea ukweli. Hii iliwapa watu kuashiria kwamba alipojifunua hivyo wakataka kumuua kwasababu aliponya mtu siku ya sabato. Walienda mbali kidogo na kusema Yesu amepagawa na mapepo.  It would be thought that when a man says what you know deep down inside is right, then you would proclaim him to be a great man of truth indeed. Too often though, as it is the nature of man, we are offended when someone tells us that we are doing wrong and we proclaim him instead to be a liar even though we know that he is speaking the truth. This is reaction the people gave when Jesus revealed that they were seeking to kill Him because He healed the man on the Sabbath day. They went far enough to even say that Jesus was possessed with a demon.</p>
<p>Mbali na kukanusha mashitaka yao ya kuwa mtuhumiwa, Yesu aliwaelezea kwanini ilikuwa vizuri kufanya mema siku ya sabato. Kama ilikuwa sahihi kwa Musa kuagiza watoto kutahiriwa  siku ya nane hata kama ilikuwa siku ya mapumziko, hivyo ni sawa na Yesu kuponya mtu sawa na ile ya tohara. Rather than refuting their accusation of being bedeviled, Jesus explained why it was right to do good on the Sabbath. If it was right for Moses to command the child to be circumcised on the eighth day even if it was the day of rest, then it was equally right for Jesus to heal the man under the same circumstances.</p>
<h2>Waliulizana kazi ya Yesu 7:25-36  Jesus’ Office Questioned 7:25-36</h2>
<p>Watu walishangazwa kwa ujasiri wa Yesu kujikiri mwenyewe kuwa ni Mwana wa Mungu, lakini pia aliwashangaza viongozi wa kidini kukaa kimya kwa maelezo ya ujasiri; hii iliwapelekea kustaajabu ukimya wake ulithibitisha kuwa Yesu alikuwa Kristo kweli, baadhi ya watu hawakuamini kuwa ni Yeye, japo walijua historia na ukoo wa Yesu na waliona kuwa Mesia hakuwa na nakala iliyoandikwa. Yesu alikanusha hoja hii tena kwa kusema kama kweli mnamjua Mungu, ndipo hamtakuwa na mashaka kwa huyu alioko--Mwana wa Mungu. The people were amazed at the boldness of Jesus to proclaim Himself to be the Son of God, but they were also amazed that the religious leaders said nothing openly as Jesus made these bold statements; this brought them to wonder if their silence was their approval that Jesus was really the Christ. Even if they thought that the rulers believed that Jesus was the Christ, some of the people did not believe that He was, for they knew the history and lineage of Jesus and they felt that the Messiah would have no such traceable records. Jesus refuted this argument by again saying if they had really known God, then there would be no doubt to as whom He was--the Son of God.</p>
<p>Pamoja kulikwako na watu ambaye hawakuamini kuwa Yesu alikuwa Kristo, kulikuwa na wengi walioamini alikuwa Yeye, na hii kuzinduka kwa umati wa watu kwa Yesu kulisababishaa viongozi wa kidini kuhofia kupoteza nafasi ya kuongoza kiroho. Tofauti na kukana mafundisho ya Yesu kwa kinywa kwa watu, walichagua badala ya kujaribu kuwa kwa Yesu walimchukua kwa nguvu kwenda kumhukum mbele ya baraza. Walituma askari wamlete Yesu kwao na baadaye tunasoma kuwa hawa watu walirudi mikono mitupu kwasababu jinsi walivyo kuwa na hofu na mamlaka kwa yale Yesu aliyoongea, kuwa wasingeweza kuendelea kumkamata.  While there were some that did not believe that Jesus was the Christ, there were many that believed that He was, and this dedication of the multitude to Jesus caused the religious leaders to fear the loss of their position as spiritual guides. Rather than refuting the doctrines of Jesus orally to the people, they chose instead to try to have Jesus taken by force and then judge Him before their council. They sent guards out to bring Jesus to them and later we read that these men came back empty handed because they so awed by the manner and authority in which Jesus spake, that they could not continue to arrest Him.</p>
<h2>Waliulizana hali ya Yesu 7:37-53  Jesus’ Circumstances Questioned 7:37-53</h2>
<p>Katika siku za mwisho za siku kuu ya vibanda, Yesu alisimama {baadhi wanaamini hatua za hekalu} na kupiga kelele kwa matangazo ya kuwa Yeye alikuwa nani. Kama tulivyoona, hadi katika sehemu hii kulikuwa na watu wengi waliokuwa na mawazo kuwa Yeye alikuwa ni nani, Lakini sasa Yesu anawataka kujua bila mashaka kwamba Yeye alikuwa maji ya uzima kama alivyolia, mtu yeyote akiwa na kiu, aje kwangu anywe {Yoh. 7:37}. Yesu alijua kwamba watu wengi bado hawaja mwamini katika ukweli wa utu wake, lakini walikuwa na fursa ya kumwamini  na kupokea Roho ya Mungu  On the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles, Jesus stood (some believe on the steps of the temple) and made a loud proclamation of who He was. As we have seen, up to this point there were many man made ideas of who He was, but now Jesus wanted them to know without a doubt that He was the water of life as He cried, “If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink” (John 7:37). Jesus knew that many people would still not believe in the reality of His person, but at least they had the chance to believe on Him and receive the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Pamoja matangazo haya ya ujasiri, bado kulikuwa na mashaka mengi kwanini Yesu hawezi kuwa Mesia; muda huu watu wanaulizana hali ile ya nafasi yake inayomzunguka ya kuzaliwa na mjini kwao. Watu walijua ktoka Mika 5:2 kwamba Yesu atakuja kutoka Bethlehem, lakini kama walivyojua Yesu alizaliwa na kutokea Galilaya. Hawakujua kuwa mama yake alimleta kwa unyeyekevu mbele ya mji wa ukoo wa kifalme wa Daudi.  Despite this bold proclamation, there were still many doubts as why Jesus could not be the Messiah; this time the people questioned His circumstances that surrounded His place of birth and home town. The people knew from Micah 5:2 that the Christ would come from Bethlehem, but as far as they knew Jesus was born and raised in Galilee. They did not know that His mother brought Him forth in a lowly stable in the royal city of David.</p>
