     <h1>Sura ya 11: Yeye ni Ufufuo na uzima.  Chapter 11: He is the Resurrection and the Life</h1>
<h2>Matakwa ya Yesu 11:1-16 The Request for Jesus 11:1-16</h2>
<h3>Matakwa ya maumbu kuwa Yesu atakuja kuomba kwa ajili ya Lazaro 11:1-6 The sisters’ request that Jesus come to pray for Lazarus 11:1-6</h3>
<p>Kulikuwa na familia mjini mwa Bethania iliyokuwa karibu na Yesu. Familia hii ilihusishwa na watu watatu: Mariam aliyeketi miguuni pa Yesu kusikiliza yale Yesu aliyokuwa anayasema {Luk. 10:39} na baadaye akatwaa ratli ya marhamu yenye thamani nyingi akapaka miguu ya Yesu na kumfuta miguu yake kwa nywele zake {12:3}, Martha, aliyekuwa mkubwa kuliko Mariamu na kumkemea Mariamu aliyekaa na kumsikiliza Yesu badala ya kumsaidia kutumika {Luk. 10:40}, na Lazaro, aliyejulikana kama rafiki wa Yesu {11:11}.  There was a family in the town of Bethany that had grown quite close to Jesus. This family consisted of three siblings: Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus to hear what he had to say (Luke 10:39) and later poured precious ointment on the feet of Jesus and then cleaned his feet with her hair (12:3), Martha, who was older than Mary and scolded her when she sat and listened to Jesus instead of helping her serve (Luke 10:40), and Lazarus, who was known of as the friend of Jesus (11:11).</p>
<p>Mwanzoni mwa sura hii, tunaona Lazaro amezidiwa kwa ugonjwa wa kutaka kumuua na maumbu zake wakatuma ujumbe kwa Yesu huko Bethabara kwamba angekuja kumsaidia kabla hajafa. Wakati Yesu anapokea ujumbe alisema, huu ugonjwa hauta muua ... Yesu alijua Lazaro atakufa, lakini pia alijua kuwa hautakuwa mwisho wa rafiki yake. At the beginning of this chapter, we see Lazarus fall ill with a deadly disease and his sisters send a request to Jesus in Bethabara that He would come help him before he died. When Jesus received the message He said, “This sickness is not unto death...” Jesus knew that Lazarus would die, but He also knew that that would not be the end of His friend.</p>
<p>Yesu pia alisema kuwa ugonjwa ulikuwa kwa ajili ya utukufu wa Mungu, ili Mwana wa Mungu apate kujitukuza. Miujiza ile aliyoifanya Yesu ilikuwa kwamba watu wamtukuze Mungu na kumheshimu {5;23} na huu muujiza ulikuwa ni zaidi ya mingine ambayo aliyokwisha kuifanya kwasababu Lazaro alikuwa amekufa kwa siku nne, ndipo hapakuwa na mashaka kuwa ufufuko wake ulikuwa ni wa nguvu za Mungu. Yesu hakufanya haraka kuitika ujumbe, wala hakuharakisha safari ya kwenda Bethania, lakini alikawia pale kwa siku mbili zaidi.Jesus also said that the disease was “for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.” The miracles that Jesus performed were so that men would glorify God and believe in Him (5:23) and this miracle was more than others that Jesus performed because Lazarus would be dead for four days, then there would be no doubt that his resurrection was by the power of God. Jesus did not immediately respond to the message, nor did He hurry to travel to Bethany, but He tarried where He was for two more days.</p>
<h3> Wanafunzi walimwambia Yesu asiende Yerusalemu 11:7-16 The disciples’ request that Jesus stay away from Jerusalem 11:7-16</h3>
<p>baada ya siku mbili, Yesu aliwatia moyo wanafunzi wake kufanya safari naye kurudi mahali Lazaro alipo. Wanafunzi walijaribu kumshawishi Yesu asiende karibu na Uyahudi kwani viongozi wa Kiyahudi walitaka kumuua {10:31, 39}. Kulikuwa na uwezekano siyo tu waliogopa kitu chochote kingeweza kutokea kwa Yesu, lakini pia walikuwa na hufu kuwa wao pia wangeweza kukumbwa na mateso kwa kuwa na ujamaa naye. After the two days, Jesus encouraged His disciples to make the journey with Him west to where Lazarus was. The disciples tried to convince Jesus not to go near Judea since the rulers of the Jews wanted to kill Him (10:31, 39). They were probably not only afraid that something would happen to Jesus, but they were also fearful that they too would suffer persecution for being associated with him.</p>
<p>Yesu aliwajibu kwa kuwapa mfano masaa kumi na mbili au kwa kuweka mipaka ya mtu kufanya kazi. Muda wa masaa kumi na mbili kutimia, ndipo giza huja na hakuna yeyote afanyaye kazi. Alikuwa akijaribu kuwasaidia kuelewa kuwa alipewa kiwango fulani cha muda kutoka kwa Baba kukamilisha kazi yake duniani. Yesu alijua kuwa alikuwa kwenye masaa ya kumi na moja na asigeweza kuacha kufanya kazi ya Mungu kwasababu ya koogopa au kukatishwa tamaa. Jesus responded by giving them an illustration of how the limitation the twelve hours or the day restrict when a man can work. When those twelve hours are over, then darkness is come and no one can work. He was trying to help them understand that He was given a certain ammount of time from the Father to complete His work on earth. Jesus knew that He was in His eleventh hour and could not cease to do the work of God because of fear or discourageent.</p>
<p>Pia aliwaambia sababu nyingine kwa kutaka kwenda, Lazaro alikuwa amelala na anatakiwa aende na kumuamsha. Alikuwa hazungumzii kuhusu kulala kawaida, lakini alilala mautini. Wanafunzi walifikiri lilikuwa jambo jema kama alikuwa amelala; wangemuacha peke yake angeweza kuamka na atapona. Ndipo Yesu aliwaambia waziwazi kuwa, Lazaro amekufa. He then told them another reason for wanting to go, Lazarus was sleeping and He wanted to go and wake him up. He was not talking about actual sleep, but the deep sleep of death. The discilples thought it was a good thing if he was sleeping; he should be left alone so that he might get rest and recover. Jesus then told them plainly that, “Lazarus is dead.”</p>
<p>Maneno yaliyofuata ya Yesu yaliyokuja kutushangaza kama alivyosema, Nami nafurahi kwa ajili yenu kwamba sikuwako huko... Mtazamo wa kwanza wa sauti ya Yesu ni kama alifurahi kuwa Lazaro amekufa, lakini maelezo yaliyofuata ya Yesu yanaeleza kusudi la Yesu kama alivyosema, kwa mkazo waweze kuamini. Yesu alijua kuwa Lazaro ataponnywa haijalishi alienda mbali au tayari alikuwa amekufa baada ya siku nne, lakini pia alijua kwamba utakuwa ushuhuda mkubwa kwa Wanafunzi kuwa Lazaro hataponywa tu ugonjwa lakini pia atafufuka mautini. Wauguzi wanaweza kutibu watu, lakini mmoja tu aliyepakwa mafuta na Mungu awezaye kufufua wafu. The next words of Jesus come as a surprise to us as He says, “And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there...” At first glance it sound as if Jesus is happy that Lazarus is dead, but the next statement explains the motive of Jesus as He says, “to the intent ye may believe.” Jesus knew that Lazarus could be healed whether He went right away or four days after he was already dead, but He also knew that it would be a greater testimony to the disciples if Lazarus was not merely healed from sickness but rather raised from the dead. Doctors could perform cures on people, but only One anointed by God could raise the dead.</p>
<p>Thomaso, aliyejulikana kama pacha kwasababu badaye alikataa kuamini kuwa Yesu alifufuka kutoka wafu, alifanya moja ya maelezo mchache ambayo tunayo yaliyonukuliwa kwake akisema. Aliwaambia Wanafunzi, twendeni na sisi, tuweze kufa pamoja naye. Japo tumeona baadhi ya mashaka katika maelezo yake kwasababu alifikiri kuwa Yesu ageuawa, Pia tumeona baadhi ya imani-- alitaka kufa pamoja na Kristo. Alijua kuwa ni bora kufa pamoja naye kuliko kuishi pasipo Yeye.  Thomas, who is known as the doubter because he later refused to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead, makes one of the few statements that we have recorded of him saying. He told the disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” Though we see some doubt in his statement because he thought that Jesus would then be put to death, we also see some faith--he was willing to die with Christ. He knew that it was better to die with Him than to live without Him.</p>
<h2>Hoja za dada zake 11:17-32  The Reasoning of the Sisters 11:17-32</h2>
<p>Kama tulivyoanza wakati tunasoma sura ya saba, akili ya kawaida haiwezi kuelewa vigtu vya Mungu na mara nyingi  hufaya vitu katika njia tofauti jinsi apendavyo. Tunaona Martha na Mariamu wakijaribu kueleza kwa Yesu namna walivyokuwa wakifikiri vitu ingekuwa vizuri kama angeweza kufanya vitu kwa njia watakavyo. As we stated when we studied chapter seven, the natural mind cannot understand the things of God and many times God will do things in a way that is contrary to how we would do it. We see Martha and Mary try to explain to Jesus how they thought things would have been better if He had only done things the way they wanted.</p>
<h3>Hoja za Martha 11:17-27  The reasoning of Martha 11:17-27</h3>
<h4>Alifikiri Yesu alichelewa sana 11:17-22 She thought Jesus was too late 11:17-22</h4>
<p>Martha aliposikia Yesu anakuja mjini, alitoka kwenda kumlaki Yesu. Kitu cha kwanza alichokisema Martha kilikuwa kile, kama Yesu angekuja mapema kaka yake asingekufa. Walimwita Yesu kwa muda mwafaka kumsaidia kaka yao, lakini Yesu hakufika {walivyofikiri} kuja na kumsaidia. Muda mwingi tuko nje ya mipaka ya Mungu na yeye huwa hafanyi kazi kwa mategemeo yetu tunafikiri tumesahauliwa au hatujaliwi. Tunatakiwa tuelewe njia za Mungu sio kama njia zetu na lazima tumwamini Yeye ahadi zake hata kama kila ulimwengu wa asili unasema kuwa haiwezekani.  When Martha heard that Jesus had come to town, she went out to meet Him. The first thing that she said was that if Jesus had only come sooner then her brother would not have died. They called for Him to come in time enough and save their brother, but Jesus failed (at least they thought) to come and help. Many times we out a time restriction on God and He does not work within our expectations we think He has forgotten us or does not care about us. We must understand that God’s ways are not our ways and we must believe in Him for the promise even if every natural element says that it is impossible.</p>
<h4>Yeye alifikiri ufufuo ulikuwa mbali sana 11:23, 24. She thought the resurrection was far away 11:23, 24</h4>
<p>Ndipo Yesu alimwambia Martha kuwa kaka yake ataishi tena na akamjibu kuwa anajua siku za mwisho kutakuwa na ufufuo na atafufuka. aliamini ufufuo, lakini hakuamini ilikuwa kwa wakati wa Martha. Watu wengi wanaamini ahadi za Mungu, lakini hawaamini kwamba wanaweza kuona zikitimia katika muda wao wa kuishi.  Jesus then told Martha that her brother would live again and she responded that she knew at the end of time there would be a resurrection and he would arise. She did believe in resurrection, but she did not believe it was for her time. Many people believe in the promises of God, but they do not believe that they will see them fulfilled in their life time.</p>
<h4>Aliamini Yesu alikuwa Mesia 11:25-27. She believed Jesus was the Messiah 11:25-27</h4>
<p>Yesu alimwambia Martha kwamba Yeye alikuwa ufufuo anayeuzungumza. Yeyote aniaminiye Mimi atakuwa na uzima wa milele, akimaanisha hatakufa. Hii ni kwa maisha ya kiroho ambayo alikuwa anayazungumzia, na hayakuwa maisha ya asili. Kama tukimwamini Yeye ndipo utu wetu wa ndani unaweza kuishi kwa miaka baada ya miili yetu kulazwa ardhini. Kwa kuwapa maisha ya kimwili aliwathibitishia kuwa anaweza pia kuwapa maisha ya kiroho nafsini. Jesus told her that He was that resurrection of which she spoke. If any man believes in Him than they can have everlasting life, which means they would never die. This is spiritual life that He is speaking about, and not just natural life. If we believe in Him then our inner man can lives for ages after our bodies are laid in the ground. By giving physical life to a body He proved that He could also give spiritual life to a soul.</p>
<p>Yesu alimuuliza Martha kama anasadiki vitu ambaye Yesu alivisema, na Martha akamjibu kwamba anaamini kuwa Yeye ni Mesia na Mwana wa Mungu. Hii imani yake ilimsaidia na kumpatia ushindi juu ya akili yake ya asili. Fahamu zake zilimwambia kuwa hakuna tumaini kwa kaka yake, lakini moyo wake ulikuwa na uwezo wa kumtegemea Kristo kumfanya kaka yake kuwa hai tena. Jesus asked Martha if she believed the things that He said, and she responded that she did believe that He was the Messiah and the Son of God. This is her faith taking hold and gaining victory over her natural mind. Her mind told her that there was no hope for her brother, but her soul was able to depend on the Christ to make her brother alive agin.</p>
<h3>Hoja za Mariamu 11:28-32. The reasoning of Mary 11:28-32</h3>
<p>Neno lilipokuja kuwa Yesu amefika mjini, Mariamu alibaki nyumbani na waombolezaji wakati Martha alikwenda kumlaki Yesu. Hii yawezekana ni kwasababu Mariamu alisikia kusononeka kwasababu Yesu hakufanya haraka kuja kumponya kaka yake. Baada ya kuongea na Yesu, Martha alirudi nyumbani kumwambia umbu lake Mariamu kuwa Mwalimu yupo na anahitaji akuone. Mariamu aliposikia kwamba Yesu alikuwa na wito maalumu kwake, aliondoka upesi na kutoka haraka kwenda kumuona Yesu.  When word came that Jesus arrived in town, Mary stayed in the house with the mourners while Martha went out to meet Him. This is possibly because she felt hurt because Jesus did not make haste to come heal her brother. After talking with Jesus, Martha returned home to tell her sister that the Master had come and that He wanted to see her. When Mary heard that Jesus was specifically calling for her, she got up and immediately went to see him.</p>
<p>Mariamu alianza kulalamika kwa Yesu sawasawa na Martha na akisema akilia, Ungalikuwepo, kaka yangu asingalikufa. Alijisikia kuwa Mungu tu ndio hufanya kazi kwa muda fulani na ilionekana kuwa Yesu hakujali sana kumsaidia kaka yake. as Mary’s initial complaint to Jesus was the same as Martha’s and she said while weeping, “If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.” She too felt that God could only work during certain times and it seemed that Jesus did not care enough to help her brother.</p>
<h2>Ufufuo wa Lazaro 11:33-44.  The Resurrection of Lazarus 11:33-44</h2>
<h3>Yesu alilia 11:33-37. Jesus wept 11:33-37</h3>
<p> Yesu aliwatoa alipowaona wanawake hawa walilia kwa kumchelewa kaka yake na kuzomea mioyoni, na walikuwa wakisumbua. Ndipo Yesu akawaambia wampeleke kaburini na alipoliona, alilia. Baadhi ya watu wanaamini kuwa Yesu alilia kwasababu alikuwa na huzuni kuwa Lazaro alikufa, na hii ni pale alipoonyesha kufikiria ile siku. Hoja hii siyo thabiti sana kwa kujua kwamba Yesu alijua kuwa Lazaro atafufuka kuwa mzima hivi punde na hivyo hakuwa na haja ya kuomboleza kwa ajili yake. Muda mwingine wakati Yesu akilia, Alikuwa akiomba kwasababu mwanadamu walikuwa hawaamwamini Mungu {Luk. 19:41-44} na hii ndio sababu hapa.  Kulikuwa na watu walikuwa wakijiuliza siku ile na kusema  kwanini Yesu hajamwokoa Lazaro wakati alikuwa na uwezo wa kusaidia watu wengine. Yesu hakulia kwa Lazaro, lakini kwasababu ya watu, iliwahusu Martha na Mariamu, hawakuwa na imani kumuona Lazaro kurudishiw uhai. It moved Jesus when He saw this woman weeping for her late brother and “He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.” He then asked to be brought to the tomb and when He saw it, He wept. Some people believe that Jesus wept because He was sad that Lazarus had died, and this is what those that were watching that day thought. This argument is not very valid for we know that Jesus knew that Lazarus would soon be raised to life and thus He had no need to lament for him. Another time when Jesus wept, He was interceding because man was not believing in God (Luke 19:41-44) and that is the reason here. There were men there that day doubting and asking why Jesus could not have saved Lazarus when He was able to help other people. Jesus was not weeping for Lazarus, but because the people, including Martha and Mary, did not have the faith to see Lazarus return to the living.</p>
<h3>Yesu aliwaamuru waliondoe jiwe 11:38-42. Jesus commanded the stone be removed 11:38-42</h3>
<p>Yesu aliwaambia watu walihamishe jiwe mbali na walifungue kaburi. Aliwataka wahamishe kila kipingamizi na mashaka ya imani yao ambayo yaliwazuia ufufuo wa lazaro. walilitoa jiwe pembeni na hivyo Lazaro alitolewa mautini, na kabla hawaja mwona akifufuliwa walitakiwa kutoa vitu pembeni.  Kabla Mungu kufanya miujiza katika maisha yetu tunatakiwa kuponya mawazo ya miili ambayo yanazuia kutoka.  Jesus told the people to remove the stone away that sealed the grave. He wanted them to remove every hinderance and stumbling block of their faith that hindered them from believing for the resurrection of Lazarus. They had put the stone in the way and were thus surrendering Lazarus to death, and before they could see Him come alive they had to remove the obstacle they placed in the way. Before God can work miracles in our lives we must get rid of carnal thoughts that hinder Him from moving.</p>
<p>Martha haraka akalitoa jiwe lililowekwa na kuwakumbusha kuwa Lazaro alikufa kwa siku nne na lile kaburi kweli lilikuwa limenuka kwa uvundo kwa kuoza mwili wake. Yesu alimkemea kwa mashakayake na kumkumbusha kuwa alimwambia ataona utukufu wa Mungu kama ataamini.  Martha quickly objected to the stone being removed and reminded Him that Lazarus had been dead for four days and that the tomb was sure to reek with the stench of his decaying body. Jesus rebuked her for her doubt and reminded her that He told her that she would see the glory of God if she would believe.</p>
<p>Jiwe lilipo ondolewa, Yesu aliinua macho yake mbinguni na kumshukuru Baba. Nami nalijua kuwa wewe wanisikia siku zote, hivyo hakuangalia kitu fulani ili kuongeza imani lake, lakini alitaka watu kuna ishara ambayo iatathibitisha kuwa Yeye alikuwa ufufuo na uzima.  When the stone was removed, Jesus lifted up His eyes to heaven and prayed to the Father. He knew that God always heard and honored His prayers, so He was not looking for something to increase His own faith, but He wanted the people to see a sign that proved that He was the Resurrection and the Life.</p>
<h3>Yesu alimwita Lazaro atoke kaburini 11:43-44. Jesus called Lazarus out of the grave 11:43-44</h3>

<p>Baada ya kushukuru, Yesu alimlia  Lazaro atoke nje. Kifo hakikuwa na chaguo lolote bali kufunguka juu ya Lazaro wakati Yesu anaoongea na tunaona kuwa alitoka pasipo kaburi kumzuia na bado alikuwa amefungwa sanda.   After He prayed, Jesus cried for Lazarus to come forth. Death had no other choice but to loosen its hold on Lazarus when Jesus spoke and we see that he comes stumbling out of the grave still bound in the grave clothes.</p>
<p>Yesu aliwaamuru watu kumuondolea sanda aliyofungiwa. Hiki kilikuwa kitu ambacho watu walikifanya na siyo Yesu--tangu wao walipomfunga pakwa na mmojawapo wa kumfungua. Mashaka yao yalibaki ndani ya kaburi na sasa wakachukua hatua ya kuamini kuwa watamwona akitembea miongoni mwa waliohai tena.  Jesus then commanded the people to remove the grave clothes from off of him. This was something the people had to do and not Jesus--since it was them that bound him they had to be the ones to unbind him. Their doubt left him in the grave and now they must take action and believe to see him walk among the living again.</p>
<h2>Kisasi cha Wayahudi 11:45-57 The Retribution of the Jews 11:45-57</h2>

<div class="highlights">
	<h1> Mkuu wa kifo #8 Master of Death</h1>
	<p>Wakati mkuu anaongea, kifo hakikuwa na chaguo bali kilimwacha Lazaro aende. Kwetu sisi, kifo ni mwisho, lakini kwa Mungu kifo siyo cha mwisho!  When the Master spoke, death had no choice but to let go of Lazarus. For us, death is so final, but with God not even death is final!</p>
	
	<p>Kristo mwenyewe alifufuka kwa ishara ya kushinda yote. Christ&apos;s own resurrection was the crowning sign of all.</p>
	
</div>

<p>Kwasababu ya muujiz huu, watu wengi walionekana sasa kumwamini Yesu, lakini kulikuwa na wengine ambayo hawakumwamini na walikimbia kuwaambia Mafarisayo kile kilichotokea ili kwamba waweze kupotosha. Mafarisayo waliwaambia makuhani, wakutane pamoja kujadili wafanye nini kuhusu Yesu. Waliogopa kwamba kama wakimwacha Yesu kuendelea kuhubiri, kufundisha na kuponya watu, ndipo watu wengi zaidi watamwamini na Warumi watasika kuhusu hili. Warumi hapana budi kuhusika kuwanyang'anya na kuwa chini ya utawala wa Kirumi na watu wake kugandamizwa zaidi. Makuhani na viongozi wengine wa kidini wangepoteza nafasi zao na taifa zima laweza kuchafuka au kuchinjwa.  Because of this miracle, many that were present now believed on Jesus, but there were others that did not believe and they ran to tell the Pharisees what happened so that they might quence it. The Pharisees told the priests, whom assembled together to discuss what they should do about Jesus. They were afraid that if they let Jesus alone to keep preaching, teaching, and healing people, then many more people would believe and the Romans would surely hear about it. The Romans would undoubtedly consider it a zealote revolt against the Roman Emporor and come in and press more restrictions on the people. The priests and other religious leaders would lose their positions and the whole nation might face expulsion or even slaughter.</p>
<p>Kayafa, mkuu wa makuhani wa mwaka ule, alifanya hotuba na alisema kuwa yafaa mtu mmoja afe kwa ajili ya taifa zima. Haikujalisha alijua au la, alikuwa hazungumzi kwa ufahamu wake, bali alitoa unabii wa neno la Mungu. Ilikuwa muhimu Yesu kufa ili kwamba ulimwengu mzima na siyo kwa Yudea kuwa huru kifoni. Wayahudi waliweza kuwa na vifaa ambayo Mungu alivitumia kumweka Yesu msalabani lakini wazo halikuanza kwao wenyewe. Mungu alikuwa na mpango alioutengeneza kabla ya misingi ya ulimwengu kuwa Yesu atakufa kibinadamu {ufu. 13:8}. Caiaphas, the high priest for the year, made a speech and He said that it important that One Man die instead of the whole nation. Whether he knew it or not, he was not speaking out of his own understanding, but he was prophecying the words of God. It was necessary that Jesus die so that the whole world and not just Judea should be free from death. The Jews might have been the tool that God used to put Jesus on the cross but the idea did not initiate from them themselves. God had a plan formed from before the foundation of the world that Jesus would die for humanity (Rev. 13:8).</p>
<p>Kwasababu ya kile waliokwisha kukisema na kwasababu ya Kayafa, makuhani waliamua kuwa kitu kimoja tu cha kufanya wamkamate Yesu na auawe. Pasaka ilikaribia na walijua tangu mwanzo kuwa Yesu siku zote huhudhuria sikukuu za Wayahudi, Hivyo walijiandaa kumkamata kwa wakati huu atakapokuwa Yerusalemu. Walitoa amri na kueneza habari kuwa mtu yeyote akimwona Yesu, atoe taarifa kwa wakuu wa dini.  Because of what they already said and because of Caiaphas’ prophecy, the preists decided that the only thing option they had was to put Jesus to death. The Passover was approaching and they knew from the past that Jesus always attended the Jewish feasts, so they prepared to catch Him during this time when He would be in Jerusalem. They gave a commandment and spread the message that if anyone should see Jesus, then they must report Him to the religious leaders.</p>
<p>Yesu alijua kuwa muda wake wa kufa ulifika, lakini haukuwa muda wake wa kukaa kimya bado. Kwasababu ya hili, Yesu hakutembea waziwazi kati ya Wayahudi, alikwenda katika mji wa Efraimu. Yesu alifanya vitu vyote kwasababu na alikuwa na kusudi la kwenda kwa huu mji. Alikuwa anafanya zaidi ili kutafuta pumziko kutoka matesoni, bali alifanya mapenzi ya Baba na kuwalinda wanafunzi na kuwaanda kwa kile ambacho kinakuja mbeleni. Hii sehemu haikuwa mbali sana na ile alikuwa akijaribiwa na shetani, na yawezekana alikjaribu kuwataandaa wanafunzi wake kukabiliana na majaribu magumu ambayo yatakuja kama wanavyoona Bwana wao atauawa, alishitakiwa kwa makosa, na kutindikwa juu ya msalaba. Pia ilikuwa karibu na Yoshua alipopigana na vita vyake vya kwanza vigumu katika Nchi ya ahadi na Yesu  alikuwa na uwezo wa kuwataka thenashara kujiandaa kupigana vita ngumu ambayo wangeweza kuvipiga.  Jesus knew that His time to die was approahing, but it was not quite time yet. Because of this, Jesus did not openly walk among the Jews, but He went into the city of Ephraim. Jesus did everything for a reason and He had a purpose for going to this city. He was doing more than just seeking rest from persecution, but He was doing the will of the Father and protecting the disciples and preparing them for what was to come ahead. This place was not too far from where He had been tempted of the devil, and perhaps He was trying to get His disciples ready to face the hard temptations that would come as they see their Master arrested, falsely accused, and hung on the cross. It was also nearby where Joshua fought his first hard battle in the Promised Land and Jesus might have wanted the twelve to be ready to fight the hardest battle that they ever would fight.</p>
