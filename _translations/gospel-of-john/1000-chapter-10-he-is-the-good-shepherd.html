<h1>Sura ya 10: Yeye ni Mchungaji Mwema. Chapter 10: He is the Good Shepherd</h1>
<p>Katika sura hii Yesu anawafunulia watu wazo kuwa Yeye ni kiongozi wa mifugo ya Israeli, ndipo akaendelea kuwaeleza zaidi habari ya wazo na kuwaonyesha jinsi gani wale hawafuati viongozi wao wa kweli. Wazo la Mgungu kuwa mchungaji wa watu siyo wazo pekee linalopatikana katika sura ya kumi ya Yohana, bali kuna mafundisho yanapatikana katika mistari mingine kadhaa, ikihusisha mstari unaojulikana sana Zaburi ya 23. In this chapter Jesus reveals to the people the concept that He is the leader of the flock of Israel, and then He goes on to explain more details of the idea and even shows how that they are not following their true leader. The idea of God being the shepherd of men is not an idea that is solely found in the tenth chapter of John, but it is a doctrine found in several other verses, including the very famous 23rd Psalm.</p>
<h2>Maelezo ya Mafundisho ya Mchungaji Mwema 10:1-6. The Illustration of the Doctrine of the Good Shepherd 10:1-6</h2>
<p>Hii sura inaanza na Yesu kuwaambia watu mfanoambayo ulieleza kuwa Yeye ni Mchungaji Mwema. Maelezo ya kuandika ni tofauti kati ya mwivi na mchungaji--mwivi atanyata kwa kupanda na kuruka ukuta kujaribu kuiba kondoo, wakati mchungaji anaweza kufungua wazi na kuingia kuwakarimu kondoo na kukomboa milki zake. Kondoo husikia sauti ya mchungaji na kuijua kumfuata Yeye. Zamani kwa siku zile Mashariki ya Kati, wachungaji hawaongozi kondoo kama watu wengi wafanyavyo kwa mifugo, bali hutumia muda mwingi kwa kondoo na kuwafundisha mlio wa sauti yake, walijua kwamba kutakuwa na usalama kutii amri zake, na watamfuata kama Yeye huwaongoza. Kwa mkono mwingine, kama kondoo hawajajua sauti ambayo inawaamuru, hautaona wakufuate baada ya kuwa mgeni kwao. Hakuna mwivi atakayejifanya kuwa mchungaji na kujaribu kuwaongoza njia, kwani ataogopa na kukimbia.  This chapter starts with Jesus telling the people a parable that illustrates that He is the Good Shepherd. The illustration points out the difference between the thief and the shepherd--the thief will sneak in by climbing over the wall to try to steal the sheep, while the shepherd can openly and honestly enter the sheepfold and retrieve his possessions. The sheep will hear the voice of the shepherd and know to follow him. In these ancient days of the Middle East, shepherds did not drive sheep as many people do with cattle, but he spent time with the sheep and they learned the sound of his voice, knew that it was safe to obey his commands, and they followed him as he lead them. On the other hand, if the sheep were not familiar with the voice that was commanding them, then you would not see them follow after the stranger. No thief could pretend to be the shepherd and try to lead them away, for they would become afraid and try to run away.</p>
<h2>Ufafanuzi wa Mafundisho ya Mchungaji Mwema 10:7-21. The Explanation of the Doctrine of the Good Shepherd 10:7-21</h2>
<h3>Mlango wa kondoo 10:7-9. The Sheep-door 10:7-9</h3>
<p>Inasemekana kwamba hapo kale zizi lilikuwa ukuta wa jiwe lenye mlango mmoja, ambayo wachungaji kadhaa walileta mifugo yao kwasababu ya usiku. Moja wa wachungaji au mtu mwingine wa mshahara anaweza kujifanya kama mlinzi na bawabu kuhakikisha kuwa hakuna mtu yeyote atakayeingilia zizi ambaye hahusiki pale. Inasemekana kuwa moja wa wachungaji alikuwa analala mbele ya mlango, ile njia kama kuna mtu yeyote anajaribu kuingia lazima atamkanyaga juu na atakuwa amemwamusha kutoka usingizini. It is said that in ancient times that the sheepfold was a stone wall with a single door, to which several shepherds would bring their flocks for the night. One of the shepherds or another hired man would act as a guard and porter to make sure that no one entered the sheep fold that did not belong there. It is even said that one of the shepherds would sleep in front of the door, that way if anyone tried to enter, they would have to step over him and risk waking him up from sleep.</p>
<p>Yesu alisema Yeye ni ule mlango wa zizi la kondoo na aliweka habari wazi sana. Yeye ni njia pekee ya kupata wokovu wa Mungu {Yoh. 14:6}. Kulikuwa na watu wengine ambayo walitokea kabla ya Yesu waliojitangaza kuwa ni Mesia au kujua njia mpya iendayo kwa Mungu, lakini Yesu alisema watu hawa wote walikuwa wezi na wanyang'anyi. Kama mtu anamfuata Mungu kweli, ndipo hawtadanganya kama wale mabii wa uongo. Hata leo kuna watu wengiwatangazao kujua njia iendayo kwa Mungu kama wanavyotanguliza baadhi ya mafundisho mapya au wazo, lakini tunahitaji kuwa na uhusiano wa ukaribu na Mungu hivyo hatutaongozwa kwa makosa na hawa watu waongo wa Mungu.  Jesus said He is that door of the sheepfold and He made this point very clear. He is the only true passage to having the salvation of God (John 14:6). There were many other men that arose before Jesus that proclaimed to be a Messiah or to know a new way to God, but Jesus said all these men were “thieves and robbers.” If a man was truly following God, then they were not deceived by such false prophets. Even today there are many men that proclaim to know the way to God as they introduce some new doctrine or idea, but we need to have a close relationship with God so that we are not lead astray by these false men of God.</p>
<p>Kama tutaingia katika mifugo ya Mungu kkupitia njia inyokaayo na nyembamba ya wokovu wa Yesu Kristo, ndipo tukakapojua kuwa kweli tumeokolewa. Ni katika sehemu hii ya kuungana naye kwa kutafuta malisho. Kama Daudi alivyosema katika Zaburi ya 23, Mchungaji hatafanya sisi tupungukiwe na kitu kwasababu Yeye anatupa mahitaji yetu yote kama anavyotuweka sisi katika malisho ya majani mabichi hutulaza {Zab. 23:2}. If we enter into the flock of God through the straight and narrow way of the salvation of Jesus Christ, then we can know that we are truly saved. It is in this place of abiding in Him that we find pasture. Like David says in the 23rd Psalm, that the Shepherd will cause us to not have want of anything because He supplies all of our needs as He makes us “to lie down in green pastures” (Psalm 23:2).</p>
<h3>Mchungaji 10:10-15. The Shepherd 10:10-15</h3>
<p>Yesu aliendelea kuwafafanulia watu kuhusu mfano wake kwa kuwaeleza nani mwenye sifa kati ya hawa. Kulikuwa na mchungaji na kulikuwa na mgeni ambayo kondoo hawamfahamu.  Jesus then goes on to enlighten the people about His parable by explaining whom the characters in it represent. There is the shepherd and there are the strangers whom the sheep do not know.</p>
<h4>Wachungaji wabaya {wageni}. The Bad Shepherds (the strangers)</h4>
<p>Wevi 10:10a--huja kwa kuua, kuiba, na kuwaharibu kondoo. Bila shaka huyu anatoka kwa shetani, ambaye alikuwa  adui wa kondoo wa Mungu tokea mwanzo alipodanganya mwanamke wa kwanza kinyume cha amri ya Mungu. shetani wakati wote yupo, na bado anatafuta kuharibu roho za watu. Thieves 10:10a--he comes to kill, steal, and destroy the sheep. Without a doubt this is referring to the devil, who has been the enemy of the flock of God since the beginning when he deceived the first woman into sinning against the command of God. Satan has always has, and still is seeking to destroy the souls of men.</p>
<p>Mtu wa mshahara 10:12-13--anachojali ni kuwa na ujira mokononi tu wa pesa na siyo kazi yenyewe. Kulikuwepo na wengi hivyo waliitwa watu wa Mungu wale waioingilia huduma kwa kusimikwa kwa faida. Hawa watu wanajali kondoo tu kuhusu matumizi binafsi kama vile sadaka na kulipa wenye vyeo. Mungu alisema na hawa wachungaji wabaya katika Ezekieli 34:2-3 Mungu asema hivi, Ole wao wachungaji wa Israeli wanajilisha wenyewe! haiwapasi wachungaji kuwalisha kondoo?  Mnawala walionona, mnajivika manyoya, mnawachinja walionona: lakini hamwalishi kondoo. Hawa watu hawakuwa na ukweli wa uthabiti, na walipojaribiwa, ndipo walipokimbia kuokoa maisha yao wenyewe.  Hirelings 10:12-13--hired hands that care only for money and not the work itself. There have been many so called “men of God” that have entered the ministry for the perk benefits. These men only care about the sheep for personal gain such as offerings and paid-parsonages. God speaks against these false shepherds in Ezekiel 34:2–3, where it says, “...Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.” These men have no real backbone, and when the trial comes, then they run away to save their own lives.</p>

<h3>Kondoo 10:16-21. The Sheep 10:16-21</h3>
<h4>Kondoo walibebwa zaidi kuliko Wayahudi. Kwa wakati huu, katika fahamu za Waebrania, hapakuwa na uwezakano mkubwa kwa mataifa kuokolewa, lakini Yesu aliwaambia kuwa utakuja muda Wayahudi na Mataifa wataunganishwa pamoja katika mwili mmoja--tunajua mwili kuwa ni kanisa.  The flock contains more than the Jews. At this time, in the minds of the Hebrew, it was almost impossible for a Gentile to be saved, but Jesus explained that there would come a time when both Jews and Gentiles would be united together in one body--we know that body to be the church.</h4>
<h4>Kondoo walibeba njia potefu ambayo haikumwani Yesu. Baada ya Yesu kusema hivi vitu, kulikuwa na watu wengine ambaye waliomwita mzimu na walisema kwamba amepagawa mapepo. Kulikuwa na watu wengi makanisani ambayo hawakumwamini Yesu kweli. Walifuata mawazo ya watu na muundo wa dini na bado walikana na kuchanganya kila siku njia ya ambayo haimpendezi Mungu. The flock contains wayward sheep that do not believe in Jesus. After Jesus had said these things, there were some men that called Him insane and said that He was demon possessed. There are many people in churches that do not really believe in Jesus. They follow man’s ideas and have a form of religion and yet they deny and contradict Christ every day with ways that are not pleasing to God.</h4>
<h2>Maombi ya Mafundisho ya Mchungaji Mwema 10:22-42. The Application of the Doctrine of the Good Shepherd 10:22-42</h2>
<p>Miezi miwili kupita baada ya Yesu kutangaza kuwa Yeye ni maji ya uzima wakati wa siku ya mwisho ya sikukuu ya vibanda. Sasa ni sikukuu ya kutabaruku, au ya kawaida sana kwetu siku hizi, Hanukkah. Tabia mpya na desturi ya Biblia na J.M. Chadwick na J.H. wanatueleza kidogo kuhusu sikukuu na asili yake:  Two months had passed since Jesus declared that He was the Water of Life during the final day of the Feast of Tabernacles. It is now the feast of dedication, or more commonly to us today, Hanukkah. The New Manners and Customs of the Bible by J. M. Freeman and J. H. Chadwick explains to us a little about the feast and its origin:</p>
<blockquote>Hii ni nsikukuu iliyoanzishwa kwa heshima ya matengenezo ya ibada ya kiungu katika hekalu, na kwaida huhutubiwa kwa matumizi ya wakfu baada ya kuwa najisi afya chini ya Waantiokia na Wepafania. Hotuba hii ilishika kasi 164 B.C., na akiba tunipata katika kitabu cha Apokrifa 1 Makabayo 4:52-59. Sikukuu ilisha kwa siku mbili, na ilikuwa inasherehekewa siyo tu katika Yerusalemu, bali kila mahali. Baadaye ilikuja kujulikana kwa jina la sikukuu ya Taa, au sikukuu ya Nuru, kwasababu ya desturi ya kuangaza nyumba wakati ikisherehekewa. Wayahudi walipuuza kuwa na tamaduni ile, wakati Wayahudi cini ya Yuda Mmakabayo kuongoza wapagani nje ya hekalu na kuwasafisha kutoka kwenye uchafu wao, walipata chupa peke yake ya mafuta ya wakfu yaliyoepukwa kutafutwa na watu wa dini. Haya yote yalikuwa kwa kuangazia taa za kuwekwa wakfu, lakini kwa muujiza hili lilifanywa kwa siku ya mwisho ya nane, na hivyo hii ikawa sherehe ya kudumu. Hii ni siku ya mapumziko inayorejelewa mpaka sasa kama Hanukkah, siku ya nane ya mwanzo ya sikukuu kati ya siku ishirini na tano ya Kislev. This was a feast instituted in honor of the restoration of divine worship in the temple, and its formal rededication to sacred uses after it had been defiled by the heathen under Antiochus Epiphanes. This dedication took place in 164 b.c., and an account of it is given in the apocryphal book 1 Maccabees 4:52–59. The feast lasted two days, and could be celebrated not only in Jerusalem, but elsewhere. In later times it was known by the name of the “Feast of Lamps,” or the “Feast of Lights,” because of the custom of illuminating the houses while celebrating it. The Jewish rabbis have a tradition that, when the Jews under Judas Maccabeus drove the heathen out of the temple and cleansed it from its pollution, they found a solitary bottle of sacred oil that had escaped the profane search of the heathen. This was all they had for lighting the sacred lamps, but by a miracle this was made to last eight days, and so this became the duration of the feast. This is the holiday referred to now as Hanukkah, an eight-day festival beginning on the twenty-fifth day of Kislev.</blockquote>
<p>Ilikuwa wakati wa sikukuu wale wakuu wa dini wa Kiyahudi walikuja kwa Yesu akiwa akitembea katika ukumbi wa hekalu la Sulemani walimuuliza swali hili, hata lini utatuhangaisha nafsi zetu? Kama wewe ndiwe Kristo utuambie waziwazi. {Yoh. 10:24}. Yesu aliwajibu kuwa alikwisha kuwaambia {Yoh. 5:36} kuwa kazi zake ndio zinazothibitisha Yeye alikuwa nani.  It was during this feast that the Jewish religious leaders came to Jesus while He walked on Solomon’s Porch in the temple and asked Him this question, “How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly” (John 10:24). Jesus reminded them that He already told them (John 5:36) that His works proved who He was.</p>
<p>Yesu alisema kuwa sababu ambayo iliwafanya wasiamini ilikuwa kwasababu hawakuwa kondoo wake. Yesu alisema kondoo wake wanamsikia sauti yake na kwa kusema hivyo, Yeye pia alifahamu wale ambayo siyo kondoo wake hawakusikia sauti yake. Tunaona maneno ya Yesu yalitimizwa baadaye, tumeona wao wameyatimiza kama alivyoyaweka maisha yake kwa ajili ya kondoo {Yoh. 10:15}. Jesus said the reason that they did not believe was because they were not His sheep. Jesus said that His sheep would hear His voice and by so saying, He also inferred that those that were not His sheep would not here His voice. Now we see the words of Jesus fulfilled-¬later we see them fulfilled even more as He lays down His life for the sheep (John 10:15).</p>
