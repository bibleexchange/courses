<h1>Ssura ya kumi na sita. Yeye ni mpaji wa Roho  Chapter 16: He is the Giver of the Spirit</h1>
<h2>Ahadi ya Roho 16:1-16 The Promise of the Spirit 16:1-16</h2>
<h3>Roho atatufariji 16:1-7 The Spirit will comfort 16:1-7</h3>
<p>Yesu alijua kwamba kitambo kidogo dhiki na majaribu yatawapata wanafunzi wake, na alifikiri kuwafariji. Hakuwaahidi kuwa hawatapata matatizo, zaidi alikuwa akiwaonya kuwa shida zitaendelea kuja; ninachowaahidi ni kwamba tunatakiwa kuyashinda yale majaribu na masimango {Zab.34:19}. Tunaweza kutembea juu ya bonde la uvuli wa mauti, lakini Yeye hutembea pamoja nasi njia yote na atatuto kwenye upande mwingine. Jesus knew that soon a time of tribulation and trial would come to His disciples, and so He sought to console them. It is never promised that we will not have problems, rather we have been warned that those problems will certainly come; what is promised is that we will be delivered out of those trials and afflictions (Psalm 34:19). We may have to walk through the valley of the shadow of death, but He is walking with us all the way and will bring us out to the other side.</p>
<p>“Yeyote afikiriye kuwaua hufanya kazi ya Mungu." Ni muda wa huzuni kuwaacha, lakini kuna watu wengi ambao wanafikiri wanamsaidia Mungu kwa kuwaambia ukweli wale wakristo wanaofikiri wanamakosa. Makundi mengi ya "makanisa" siku hizi wanasimama kwa ajili ya dhambi na kuliwalinda wasio na haki wakati huohuo wanawalaumu wahubiri watakatifu kwa kukosa upendo. Wanaita uovu ni wema na wema ni uovu {Isay 5:20}.  Whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.” It is a sad time that we live in, but there are many people that think they are helping God out by telling true Christians that they think they are wrong. The majority of “churches” this day will stand up for sin and defend the unrighteous while at the same time they condemn the preacher of holiness for not having any love. They call evil good and good evil (Isaiah 5:20).</p>
<p>Yesu aliwapa bure mfariji kwa kuwaahidi ujio wa mfariji, ambaye ni Roho Mtakatifu {Yoh. 14:26; Mdo 9:31}. Roho akikaa juu yetu, ndipo tutakuwa na furaha Roho akitukalia { IPetr 4:14}.  Jesus offered them consolation by promising the advent of the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit (John 14:26; Acts 9:31). If the Spirit is resting upon us, then we can be happy even if we are reproached (I Peter 4:14).</p>
<h3> Roho atajithibitisha 16:8-11The Spirit will convict 16:8-11</h3>
<h4>Roho atalithibitisha Neno la dhambi 16:9 The Spirit will reprove the world of sin 16:9</h4>
<h4> Roho atalithibitisha Neno la haki 16:10The Spirit will reprove the world of righteousness 16:10</h4>
<h4>Roho atalithibitisha Neno la hukumu 16:11 The Spirit will reprove the world of judgment 16:11</h4>
<h3>Roho atatufundisha 16:12-16 The Spirit will teach 16:12-16</h3>
<p>Kulikuwa na vitu vingi ambayo Yesu alitaka kuwaambia wanafunzi wake, lakini alijua kuwa bado hayajawatokea. Hiyo haimaanishi kwamba hivi vitu havitakuwa na mwafaka, Yesu aliwaahidi Roho matakatifu atavifunua vitu hivi kwenu. Tunapojifunza Neno la Mungu, hatutafikia kwa uwezo wa elimu zetu, bali tunahitaji kutafuta mafunuo ya Roho kulifanya Neno kuwa hai kwetu. Kuna mambo mengi ambavyo hatuwezi kuvijua kiasili, bali Rohoni tunaweza kuvionyeshwa { IKor 2:9, 10;  Efes 3:1-6}.  There were many things that Jesus wanted to tell His disciples, but He knew that they were not yet ready to bare them. That did not mean that they would never be able to comprehend these hidden things, for Jesus promised a time when the Holy Spirit reveal to them these things. When we study the Word of God, we cannot approach the task with mere intellectual ability, but we need to seek the revelation of the Spirit to make the Word alive to us. There are many things that cannot be understood by natural senses, but the Sprit can show them to us (I Corinthians 2:9, 10; Ephesians 3:1-6).</p>
<h2> Unabii wa huzuni na furaha 16:17-33 The Prophecy of Sorrow and Joy 16:17-33</h2>
<h3>Huzuni juu ya kuondoka kwake 16:17-22 Sorrow over His departure 16:17-22</h3>
<p>Wanafunzi hawakuelewa Yesu alichokimaanisha aliposema, "Kitambo kodogo, hamtaniona: na tena, kitambo kidogo, nanyi mtaniona, kwasababu naenda kwa Baba." Japo hawakuelewa, hawakumuuliza Yesu anamaanisha nini. Yesu alijua wanawaza nini na aliwajibu swali lao pasipo wao kusikika. Aliwaweka wazi sana kuwa wakati utafika mtakaohuzunishwa na tukio hilohilo ambayo utsababisha ulimwengu kufurahi; tunajua tukio ambaye atasulubishwa.    The disciples did not understand what Jesus meant when He said, “A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.” Though they did not understand, they did not ask Jesus what He meant. Jesus knew what they were thinking and responded to their questions without them being voiced. He made it veryclear that there would soon be a time when they would lament at the same event that caused the world to rejoice; we know this event to be the crucifixion.</p>
<p> Yesu aliwafariji kwa kuwaambia jueni kuwa huzuni yao haina mwisho, kama vile mama aliaye sana akijifungua, punde huyasahau yale maumivu anapopakata mtoto. Kusulubishwa hakika kuliwaogofya wanafunzi kama ilivyotokea, lakini baadaye waliweza kuangalia nyuma na kukiri kuwa ni furaha kuu kwa kupata wokovu. Nyaraka mbili za Petro { IPetr 1:10,11} na {IYoh. 1;7; 3:16} baadaye wakatoa ushuhuda kuwa alisulubiwa kikatili ushuhuda wao ulithibitishwa na wema wa wanadamu. Jesus comforted them by letting them know that their sorrow would not last, for as a mother may cry greatly during child birth, she soon forgets the pain as she holds her new born babe. The crucifixion surely would seem horrifying to the disciples as it occurred, but afterwards they would be able to look back at it and proclaim that it was a great joy for it brought them salvation. Both Peter (I Peter 1:10, 11) and John (I John 1:7; 3:16) later give witness that this brutal crucifixion that they witnessed proved to be for the betterment of humanity.</p>
<h3>Furaha katika majibu ya maombi 16:32-28 Joy over answered prayer 16:23-28</h3>
<p>Ndipo Yesu aliwaambia wanafunzi wake kuhusu furaha ile itakayokuja kwao kwasababu Baba atawasikia na kujibu majibu yao. Aliwaambia kuwa wakati utafika kwani Yeye hatakuwa wakala kati yao na Baba kwa mahitaji maalumu, bali wenyewe wanaweza kumwomba Baba kwa jina la Yesu na atawajibu maombi yao. Ukimpenda Yesu ndipo Baba atawapenda na kuwajibu maombi yenu. Kwasababu ya kazi ya Yesu msalabani tunapata kipaumbele cha kwenda kwa ujari katika kiti cha Mungu na kuweka mahitaji yetu kwake. {Ebr. 4:14-16}. Jesus then told His disciples about a joy that would come to them because of how the Father would hear and answer their prayers. He told them that a time would come when He would not have to be an agent between them and the Father for special requests, but they themselves would be able to petition God in the name of Jesus and He would answer their prayers. If they loved Jesus then God would love them and answer their prayers. Because of the work of Jesus on the cross we have the privilege to go boldly to the throne of God and make requests of Him (Heb. 4:14-16).</p>
<p>Yesu pia aliwaambia wakati ukifika, hatasema kwa mithali na mifano, bali atalitangaza wazi kwao Neno la Baba. Agano la kale zimejawa na aina za ishara, na Yesu alipokuwa duniani, mafundisho yake mengi aliyafanya kwa mifano. Sasa, kama tulivyotaja hapo juu, Yesu atamtuma Roho wa Kweli na kama mtu anatafuta kujua Neno la Mungu, ndipo atafanya mpango wa kumjua Yeye.   Jesus also said that when that time came, He would no longer speak to them in proverbs and parables, but He would openly declare to them the Word of the Father. The Old Testament is filled with types and symbols, and while Jesus was on the earth, most of His teaching was done through parables. Now, as we mentioned above, Jesus has sent the Spirit of Truth and if a man is truly seeking to know the things of God’s Word, then He will make them plainly known to him.</p>
<h3>Amani katika dhiki 16:29-33  Peace in tribulation 16:29-33</h3>
<p>Wanafunzi walimwambia Yesu hata sasa wanamwelewa kile alichokuwa anakisema na kumwamini kuwa ni Mwana wa Mungu. Yesu aliwauliza kama wanamwamini kweli kama alivyowatahadharisha dhiki inakuja. Alijua kuwa usiku ule atasalitiwa na kushitakiwa. Kama wanamwamini kweli, ndipo wataweza kubaki naye hata kama watateswa pamoja naye. Wanafunzi waliamini katika vichwa vyao, lakini mioyo yao ilikuwa bado haijapokea wokovu huo. Kulikuwa na watu baadhi waliokuwa wanajifunza historia na waliamini kuwa Yesu alikuwa mtu mkuu, lakini hakuja kwa uzoefu wa wokovu. Dini zetu tunahitaji kuziweka zaidi katika fahamu zetu, bali zinatakiwa kutoka katika sehemu ya ndani sana za nafsi zetu.   The disciples told Jesus that even now they understood what He was saying and believed that He was the Son of God. Jesus asked them if they really believed as He warned them of the coming tribulation. He knew that later that night He would be betrayed and executed. If they truly believed, then they would stay with Him even though it might mean being persecuted with Him. The disciples believed in their head, but their hearts had not yet received this same revelation. There are some men that study history and believe that Jesus was a great man, but they never really come to a salvation experience. Our religion needs to be more than one of the intellect, but it must be from the innermost soul.</p>
<p>Yesu alijua kuwa wanamtafuta na kumkamata, lakini pia alijua kuwa hayupo peke yake ila Baba yu pamoja naye, Hakika tutakuwa na raha hatakama watu watasimama kinyume chetu, Mungu bado atakuwa upande wetu.  Jesus knew that they would all forsake Him and flee, but He also knew that He would not be alone for the Father would be with Him. We can rest assure that even if all mankind turns against us, then God will still be with us.</p>
<p>Alihitimisha sura kwa kuwaambia naongea vitu hivi nikihusisha sura ya kumi na tatu na kumi na nne kwa kuwaambia wajue kutafuta amani hata kama wako katikati ya dhiki. Yesu aliwahakikishia kwamba dhiki hii inakuja, lakini haitaweza kuwaharibu na kuupindua ulimwengu. Mungu hakusema hivi vitu vitakuwa rahisi kwetu, bali alisema atatusaidia kwa kila jaribu.  He concluded the chapter by telling them that He spoke these things consisting of chapter thirteen and fourteen to let them know that they could find peace in Him even in the midst of tribulation. Jesus assured them that this tribulation would come, but they should not let it destroy them for He has overcome the whole world. God never said that things would be easy for us, but He did say that He would help us through every trial.</p>
