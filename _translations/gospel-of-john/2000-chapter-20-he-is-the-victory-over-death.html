<h1>Chapter 20: He is the Victory over Death</h1>
<p>The capstone of the Gospel of John is authenticated in this twentieth chapter as we see proof of the deity of JESUS CHRIST our LORD, as the Risen Savior. It was one thing for a man to raise someone else from the dead, but it is an even greater thing to raise yourself out of a tomb after three days.</p>
<h2>Jesus’ Tomb Found Empty 20:1-10</h2>
<p>As stated in the last chapter, the body of Jesus had been prepared for burial by Joseph and Nicodemus and laid in a tomb. A careful consideration of the method of burial in those rock-hewn tombs shows that the wrappings of the head were not a part of the wrappings on the body, but was separate. The body was carried, and laid with the feet toward the opening, and the head further in. The body was placed on a stone ledge where there was a slightly elevated place for the head.</p>
<p>Some woman had seen the place where Joseph and Nicodemus had laid the body of Jesus, and they went home to prepare spices and ointments to prepare His body for burial. They did not return that day to apply the spices to the body, for it was Friday and at sundown the Sabbath would begin and according to Jewish Law they were not supposed to labor (Luke 23:54-56).</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, these woman, amongst whom was Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and a woman named Joanna, returned to the tomb to prepare the body (Luke 24:1, 10). As they came to the tomb, there was a great earth quake as an angel came down from heaven and rolled away the stone that covered the door of the tomb. The Roman guards that were in charge of watching the tomb were so frightened that they fainted at the sight of this heavenly visitor (Matt. 28:1-4). The women looked inside the tomb to find that the body of Jesus was already gone and two angels sat where it had been. These angels reminded the women of Jesus’ prophecy of His rising after three days and told them to go tell the disciples that Jesus was risen (Luke 24:1-8; Mark 16:6-8).</p>

<p>The women ran to tell the good news to the disciples. Nine of the eleven believed their words to be just idle tales (Luke 24:9-12), but Peter and John immediately headed for the tomb with Mary Magdalene following after them. John, being much younger than Peter, reached the tomb first and looked inside, but he did not enter the tomb. When Peter reached the tomb, he went right in and John went in after him. They saw the grave clothes lying where the body had been, but they did not see that angels that the woman had talked about. They returned home, but Mary Magdalene stood outside of the tomb weeping.</p>
<h2>Jesus’ Appearance to Mary Magdalene 20:11-18</h2>
<p>After some time of standing there weeping, Mary stooped down and looked into the tomb probably to get a last look at the place where her beloved Master had lain. As far as she knew, someone had stolen the body and she might never know where they had taken it. When she looked in she saw the two angels sitting where Jesus had lain. One of the angels asked her why she was crying and Mary responded that it was because she did not know where Jesus’ body was.</p>
<p>Mary then turned away, possibly because she could not bare to look at the sight any longer and saw a man standing in the garden. Possibly because her eyes were blurry because of her tears or because she did not want to look the man in the face, she did not realize that this man was Jesus, but she thought that He was the man in charge of the garden. Jesus asked Mary why she was crying and what she was looking for in the garden. Mary thought that possibly this “gardener” took away the body of Jesus or at least saw who had taken Him and asked Him to tell her so that she could properly take care of the body.</p>
<p>Jesus responded by simply saying her name, and He did so in such a way as that now she realized who He was. She cried out, “Rabboni” and ran to hug Him, but Jesus stopped her by telling her that He had not yet ascended to the Father. He told her to return to the disciples and tell them that she saw Jesus and that He was soon to ascend to heaven.</p>
<h2>Jesus’ Appearance to the Disciples 20:19-29</h2>
<h3>The First Appearance 18:19-25</h3>
<p>The disciples did not know what had happened to the body of Jesus, but they knew that it was nowhere to be found. The Jews had suspicions before this day that the disciples would try to steal the body to make it look like Jesus rose from the dead, and that was why they had Pilate heavily guard the tomb. The disciples thought that the Jews would blame them for the disappearance of the body and they would try to persecute them because of it. All of them except for Thomas secretly gathered themselves in a room and locked all the doors and closed the windows to try to hide from the Jews.</p>
<p>The disciples might have been able to conceal their location from the Jews, but Jesus knew exactly where they were. That very same Sunday evening He appeared in the midst of them even though the doors had been locked. He showed them His hands which had been scared by the nails and His side that had been pierced by the soldiers spear. These things proved that He was genuine and the disciples rejoiced at His presence. Jesus spoke to them words of consolation as well as gave them promises of power.</p>
<h3>The Second Appearance 18:26-29</h3>
<p>After Jesus left the disciples, they went and found Thomas to tell him what had happened. Thomas refused to believe and said that the only way he would was if he saw the wounds himself. Eight days after this, the disciples were once again gathered and Thomas got his wish. Jesus appeared to them again and said, “Peace be with you.” He then told Thomas to feel His hands and side and to believe and not doubt. At this, Thomas replied in faith and said, “My Lord and my God!”</p>
<p>Don’t wait to see before you believe! Anyone can believe a thing once they have seen it for themselves, but it takes real faith to believe the Word of God when you have not even had as much as a glimpse of its fulfillment.</p>
