<h1>Sura ya 8: Yeye ni mtetezi wa wanyonge  Chapter 8: He is the Defender of the Weak</h1>
<h2>Yesu alipaza sauti kwa mwanamke mzinifu 8:1-11 Jesus Pardons the Adulterous Woman 8:1-11</h2>
<h3>Mashitaka 8:1-5a The Accusation 8:1-5a</h3>
<p>Mwanzoni mwa sura hii tunaona Yesu anapanda kwenda katika mlima wa mizeituni baada ya siku yake ya kujibu maswali na kukanusha mbali mashitaka ya watu yaliyoelezwa katika sura iliyopita. Kukaa kimya yawezekana kuwa alienda kule kuomba kupokea nguvu na hekima ya kuvipiga vita vilivyo mbele yake. At the beginning of this chapter we see Jesus going up into the Mount of Olives after His day of answering question and refuting false accusations of the people described in the previous chapter. It is quite probable that He went there to pray to receive strength and wisdom to face the battles ahead of Him.</p>
<p>Asubuhi alirudi hekaluni na kuwafundisha watu wale waliokuwepo pale. Alipokuwa anafundisha, Mafarisayo wakamletea mwanamke aliyekuwa amefumaniwa kwa tendo la uzinzi. Walimkumbusha kuwa hukumu ya kosa hili kulingana na Musa alivyokuwa anawapiga mawe {Walawi.20:10} In the morning He went back to the temple and taught the people that were there. While He was teaching, the Pharisees brought to Him a woman that had been caught in the act of adultery. They reminded Him that the judgment for this crime according to Moses was that she should be stoned (Lev. 20:10).</p>
<h3>Swali 8:5b  The Question 8:5b</h3>
<p>Ndipo Mafarisayo walipouliza swali kwa Yesu, nawe wasemaje? Walikuwa wanamtega Yesu, kwasababu akisema apigwe mawe, watamwita mkorofi na muuaji. Kama akisema muachieni huru, pia wangesema kuwa hajali sheria za Musa. Ndipo walipofikiri wamemuwekw Yesu katika mtego, hawakutambua kwmba Yesu alijua mioyo yao na akili zao na alikuwa anajua wazi mitego yao.  The Pharisees then proposed a question to Jesus, “What sayest thou?” They were looking to trap Jesus, because if he said to stone her, then they would call Him heartless and a murderer. If He said to let her go free, then they would say that He had no regard to the law of Moses. While they may have thought they had Jesus in a “catch-22,” they did not realize that Jesus knew their hearts and minds and was well aware of their trap.</p>
<h3>Wajibu 8:6-9  The Response 8:6-9</h3>
<h4>Alikaa kimya akiandika 8:6  Some silent writing 8:6</h4>
<p>Badala ya kuwapa mafarisayo jibu, aliinama na kuanza kuandika kwa kidole chake chini. Maandiko hayajaashiria kile alichokuwa anakiandika, ila baadhi wanaamini alikuwa anaandika Amri Kumi na wengine wanaamini kuwa alikuwa anaandika dhambi ya wale waliokuwepo. Instead of giving the Pharisees an answer, He bent down and started writing on the ground with His finger. There is no indication in Scripture of what He wrote, but some believe He was writing the Ten Commandments and others believe that He was writing the sins of those present.</p>

<funga kwa maneno. Nahisi aliandika katika mchanga sheria na majina yao. Aliandika nini mchanga kilichotia fahamu zao hatiani na ile ilikuwa ni ni neema ya kazi, Yesu hakuja kuharibu mashtaka yao bali kuwasaidia, katika ya lawama zao, Yeye bado aliendelea kuwapa nafasi ya kutubu. Aliandika katika mchanga kile kilichohitajiwa kuonekana. -- James Reynolds, sr.   blockquote><p>I feel he wrote in the sand the law and their name by it. What he wrote in the sand convicted their conscious and that is grace at work, Jesus did not come to destroy his accusers but to save them, in the midst of their accusations, he is still giving them opportunity to repent. He wrote in the sand what they needed to see. -- James Reynolds, Sr.

<h4>Kuitwa muuaji asiyekuwa na kosa 8:7-9 A call for an immaculate executioner 8:7-9</h4>
<p>Mafarisayo waliendelea kumuuliza Yesu na kumgandamiza kwa majibu yake. Mwishoni Yesu aliwapa jibu. Alisimama kwa miguu yake na kuwaambia yule asiye na dhambi miongoni mwenu na awe wa kwanza kumtupia jiwe. Baada ya kusema hivyo, aliinama chini na kuendelea kuandika.  The Pharisees continued to ask Jesus and press Him for an answer. Jesus finally did give them an answer. He rose to His feet and told them that He that was sinless should be the one to throw the first stone. After saying this, He bent down and continued to write.</p>
<p>This answer surprised the Pharisees; they knew all knew that they had sinned and were convicted by their consciences. They may have been convicted, but they were not repentant. They could have chosen to make their hearts right with God, but instead they continued in their sin and were still driven by a desire to destroy Jesus. One by one they started to leave knowing that their plan to trick Jesus had failed this time.</p>
<h3>Hukumu 8:10-11 The Judgment 8:10-11</h3>
<p>Yesu alipojua wote wameondoka, alimwangalia mwanamke na kumuuliza wako wapi washitaki wako. Mwanamke alimwambia hakuna hata mmoja anayemshitaki sasa. Yesu alimwambia mwanamke au hawakuhumu. Yesu hakuwa na dhambi na hivyo alikuwa na haki kumtupia jiwe yule mwanamke, lakini badala yake alichagua kumsamehe. When Jesus knew that all the men were gone, He looked up at the woman and asked her where her accusers were. She told Him that there was no one accusing her now. He told her that He did not condemn her either. Jesus was sinless and thus had the right to throw the stone at her, but He instead chose to forgive her.</p>
<p>Yesu alimwambia yule mwanamke aende na asifanye dhambi tena, ambaye ni sawa na amri ile aliyompa mtu katika sura ya tano {5:14}. Neema ya Mungu haiwezi kutupa sisi kibali cha dhambi, lakini ni nguvu ya kufunguliwa na kutuhifadhi kutoka dhambini {Rum. 6:15}.  Jesus told the woman to go and sin no more, which is similar to the command that he gave the man in chapter five (5:14). The grace of God does not give us a license to sin, but it is the power to deliver and keep us from sin (Rom. 6:15).</p>
<h2>Yesu alianzisha ushuhuda wake 8:12-30 Jesus Establishes His Testimony 8:12-30</h2>
<h3>Mashahidi wa Yesu-Mwana na Baba 8:12-20 The witnesses of Jesus-The Son and Father 8:12-20</h3>
<p>Baabaye Yesu aliwaambia watu kuwa alikuwa nuru ya ulimwengu, lakini Wayahudi hawakuamini ushuhuda wake kwani walishindwa alipokuwa anajikiri mwenyewe. Yesu alijithibitisha kwao kuwa ushuhuda wake ni kweli, ingawa hawawezi kuutambua, Yesu alijua kuwa alikija kutoka milki ya mbinguni. Jesus later told the people that He was the Light of the world, but the Jews would not believe His testimony for they felt He was self-proclaimed. Jesus affirmed to them that His testimony was true, for although they might have not realized it, Jesus knew that He came from the realms of heaven.</p>
<p>Yesu alikuwa na ushahidi mwingine kuthibitisha neno lake, na yule alikuwa Baba. Wayahudi walimuuliza Baba yako yuko wapi, na Yesu aliwaambia kuwa hamumjui Yeye wala Baba, kama mlimjua hata mmoja, ndipo mngemjua na mwingine. Yesu hakusema kuwa alikuwa Baba, kwa kuwa yeye na Baba yake ni wamoja na hawatatengana kwa mapenzi na akili kwani  wanaurafiki kwa umoja ndipo pia wakajua na wengine. Jesus had another witness to verify His words, and that was the Father. The Jews asked Him who His Father was, and Jesus told them that they did not truly know Him nor His Father, for if they really knew one, then they would know the other. Jesus was not saying that He was the Father, but that He and His Father were so united and inseparable in will and mind that if you were to fellowship with one then you would also know the other.</p>
<h3>Asli ya Yesu-mbinguni 8:21-24  The origin of Jesus-Heaven 8:21-24</h3>
<p>Yesu aliwaambia Wayahudi kuwa siku moja atarudi mbinguni alikotoka na wale ambaye hawata kuja kwake. Sababu ambayo hawawezi kwenda mbinguni ni mioyo yao kuwa imejaa kutokuamini na dhambi. Hawahitaji kutubu, kwahiyo baadaye watafia ile dhambi.  Jesus told the Jews that He would one day return to heaven from where He came and that they would not be able to come after Him. The reason that they would not be able to go to heaven was that their hearts were filled with unbelief and sin. They were not willing to repent, so they would ultimately die in that sin.</p>
<h3>Asili ya Yesu-kujishusha 8:25-30 The nature of Jesus-Submissive 8:25-30</h3>
<h4>Alijishusha kwa neno la Baba 8:26-27  Submissive to the words of the Father 8:26-27</h4>
<h4>Alijishusha kwa kifo 8:28 Submissive to death 8:28</h4>
<h4>Alijishusha kwa mapenzi ya Baba 8:29  Submissive to the will of the Father 8:29</h4>
<h2>Yesu aliwatenga Wanafunzi wake 8:31-51  Jesus Classifies His Disciples 8:31-51</h2>
<h3>Sifa za Wanafunzi 8:31-32 The Qualifications of Disciples 8:31-32</h3>
<h4>Wanfunzi lazima waendelee katika neno la Yesu 8:31 Disciples must continue in the words of Jesus 8:31</h4>
<h4>Wanafunzi lazima wajue ukweli 8:32 Disciples must know the truth 8:32</h4>
<h3> Upendeleo wa Wanafunzi 8:33-36 The Privileges of Disciples 8:33-36</h3>
<h4>Makao ya milele 8:35 Abiding forever 8:35</h4>
<h4>Uhuru 8:36 Freedom 8:36</h4>
<h3>Kujitoa kwenye sifa ya wanafunzi 8:37-51 The Disqualifications of Disciples 8:37-51</h3>
<h4>Hawakuwa na neno la Mungu katika mioyo yao 8:37  Not having the words of Jesus in their heart 8:37</h4>
<h4>Hawafuati mifano ya Ibrahimu 8:39-40  Not following the example of Abraham 8:39-40</h4>
<h4>Hawakumpenda Yesu 8:42  Not loving Jesus 8:42</h4>
<h4>Wanatii tamaa za ya shetani 8:44  Obeying the lusts of the devil 8:44</h4>
<h4>Hawaamini maneno ya Yesu 8:45-46  Not believing the words of Jesus 8:45-46</h4>
<h4>Hawasikii maneno ya Baba 8:47  Not hearing the words of the Father 8:47</h4>
<h4>Hawakumheshimu Kristo 8:49 Dishonoring Christ 8:49</h4>
<p>Yesu alijifunua kwa Mafarisayo kuwa isiwe kwa Wanafunzi wake na wasitii maneno yake au kufuata matendo yake wala pia wasiwe watoto wa Baba, kwa kuwa Yeye na Baba ni wamoja. Ukimkana Yesu, umemkana Baba pia {I Yoh. 2:23} Jesus revealed to the Pharisees that in not being His disciples and not obeying His words or following His actions that they were also not children of the Father, for He and His Father are one. If you deny Jesus, the you also deny the Father (I John 2:23).</p>
<h2>Yesu alithibitisha tena mamlaka yake 8:52-59 Jesus Reaffirms His Authority 8:52-59</h2>
<p>Wayahudi walipindua kwasababu Yesu aliahidi katika mstari wa hamsini na moja kuwa wale wote walishikao neno langu watakuwa na uzima wa milele. Katika akili ya Wayahudi,  Ibrahimu alikuwa mtu mkuu sana ambaye aliishi kama yeye, mbali na manabii wengine wote na watu wa Mungu, walikufa, hivyo kila mmoja piaq kweli walikufa. Hawakumtaka Yesu kujitangaza mwenyewe kuwa mkubwa kuliko wazee wao wakuu. The Jews were upset because Jesus had promised in verse fifty-one that all those that would keep His sayings could have eternal life. In the minds of these Jews, Abraham was the greatest man that had ever lived and if he, along with all the other prophets and men of God, died, then everyone else was sure to die. They did not like Jesus proclaiming Himself to be greater then their patriarchs.</p>
<p>Yesu alibainisha kuwa hakujitangaza yeye mwenyewe wamfanye mkuu, bali Yeye alikuwa na baraka za Baba zinazofanya Yeye kuwa mkuu. Zaidi alielezea kuwa Yeye sio mkubwa tu kuliko Ibrahim, bali alikuwako kabla ya Ibrahim. Wayahudi walikasirika kwa ukweli huu na walifikiri kummaliza kwa kumpiga mawe mpaka kufa, lakini ilikuwa bado muda wa Yesu kufa, aliweza kuepuka ghadhabu yao.  Jesus clarified that it was not His own self proclamation that made Him great, but that it was the blessing of the Father that made Him great. He further explained that He was not only greater than Abraham, but that He was also existent before Abraham. The Jews were angered at this truth and they sought to execute Jesus by stoning Him to death, but since it was not yet Jesus’ time to die, He was able to escape their fury unharmed.</p>
