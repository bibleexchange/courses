<h1>Sura ya kumi na nne: Yeye ni mfariji. Chapter 14: He is the Consoler</h1>
<p>Sura hii ni mwendelezo wa mazungumzo yaliyoanza katika sura ya kumi na tatu kati ya Yesu na wanafunzi walivyokula mlo wa mwisho. Mwishoni mwa sura ya kumi na tatu aliwaambia wanafunzi wake kwamba atawaacha na hawezi kurudi haraka, mpaka atakapopata baadaye ya kutufuata {Yoh.13:36}. Sura hii ni kuwatia moyo wanafunzi kuitunza imani katika sura ya Yesu ya kimwili alivyowaacha.  This chapter is a continuation of the conversation that began in chapter thirteen between Christ and His disciples as they ate the Last Supper. In the end of chapter thirteen Jesus told His disciples that He would be leaving them and that they could not immediately come with Him, though they would be permitted later on to follow Him (John 13:36). This chapter is an encouragement to the disciples to keep the faith in the face of Jesus physically leaving them.</p>
<h2>Yesu aliwahakikishia kuwa kutakuwa na sehemu ya pumziko14:1-4 Jesus Assured Them that There Would be a Place of Rest 14:1-4</h2>
<p>Kama tulivyoona maandalizi ya Yesu kuwaacha wanafunzi wake, mara zote tumeona huruma juu yao. Alitamani kuwa angeendelea katika mafundisho yake haijalishi walimtafuta kumkamata kwa macho ya nyama. Yesu angetumia muda mwingi kujibizana nao juu ya mashitaka yao na umaarufu wao wangeshindwa, lakini badala yake alisema maneno makuu ya huruma, "Msifadhaike mioyoni mwenu" {Yoh. 14:1}. Kama mkiamini katika Yeye, ndipo hamtakuwa na mashaka ya kushindwa. As we see Jesus preparing to leave His disciples, we constantly see His compassion towards them. He has a desire that they would continue in His doctrine even though they would no longer be able to behold Him with the carnal eye. Jesus could have spent time railing on them for their faults and eminent failures, but instead He offered great words of consolation, “Let not your heart be troubled” (John 14:1). If they would only believe in Him, then they should have no fear of falling.</p>
<p>Katika mstari wa pili Yesu aliwaahidi wanafunzi kuwa nyumbani kwa Baba yake {mbinguni} kuna makao mengi na anaenda kuandaa mahali kwa wale watakaye mfuata watakuwa na makao ya milele. Alitumia muda mwingi kuwaandaa wanafunzi wake na sasa anaenda kuwaandalia mahali. In verse two Jesus promises the twelve that in His Father’s house (heaven) there are many mansions and He was going there to prepare a place for those that would follow Him to that celestial destination. He had spent time preparing His disciples and now He was going to prepare a place for them.</p>
<h3>Sehemu ya kupumzika kimwili  A physical place of rest</h3>
<p>Maisha haya yakiisha tutauacha huu ulimwengu wa shida na majaribu na tutakuwa salama milele na tutakuwa ndani ya milango pekee ya mbinguni. Haitajalisha tulishindana na mwili, shinda asili ya zamani, au mishale iliyokushambulia ya ibilisi, bali tutakuwa milele katika ushirika wa kweli wa Bwana na mwokozi katika mahali ambayo ni halisi kuliko ya dunia tunayoishi. Ufunuo ishirini na moja unatupa maelezo ya Yerusalemu mpya ni kwa wangavu wake wote ni kwa nyumba ya wale waliooshwa kwa damu na kuzishika kweli amri za Mungu. 2Kor 5:1 inasema, kwa maana twajua ya kuwa nyumba ya maskani yetu iliyo ya dunia hii ikiharibiwa, tunalo jengo litokalo kwa Mungu, nyumba isiyofanywa kwa mikono, iliyo ya milele mbinguni. When this life is over we will leave this world of troubles and trials and we will forever be in safety and solitude within the gates of heaven. No longer will we have to wrestle with the flesh, conquer the old nature, or dart the attacks of the devil, but we will forever be in true fellowship with our Lord and Savior in a place that is realer than the earth on which we dwell. Revelation twenty-one gives us a description of the New Jerusalem with all of its splendor that is to be the home of those that have been washed in the blood and have held true to the commandments of God. II Corinthians 5:1 says, “For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.”</p>
<h3>Sehemu ya kupumzika kiroho  A spiritual place of rest</h3>
<p>Kama wafuasi wa Kristo, hatuwezi kuangalia mbele tuu katika sehemu ya kustarehe, bali tunaweza kuanza kuzoea kustarehe kuanzia sasa. Japo miili yetu bado inakumbana na shida na kughafilika, Nafsi zetu zinaweza kuwa katika sehemu ya faraja kwatika Bwana.  As followers of Christ, we not only can look forward to a place of rest off in the future, but we can start to experience that rest now. While our body still face troubles and afflictions, our soul can be in a place of comfort in the Lord.</p>
<h2>Yesu alitangaza kwao Njia katika pumziko hili 14:5-14  Jesus Announced to Them the Way to this Rest 14:5-14</h2>
<p>Baada ya kuwaambia hayo anaweza kutupa makao na maisha yenye pumziko, wanafunzi walitaka kujua namna gani wataweza kupata ile sehemu na Thomaso akamwambia, Bwana, sisi hatujui uendeko,  nasi twijuaje njia? {Yoh. 14:5}. Yesu aliwaambia kuwa Yeye ni njia ya kwenda kwa Mungu. Hakuna njia nyingi kwa mtu apitaye kwa amani kwenda kwa Mungu bali kupitia kwa Yesu mwenyewe.   After being told that they would soon be given a mansion and a life of rest, the disciples wanted to know how they should get to that location and Thomas said, “Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?” (John 14:5). Jesus explained that He was the way to God. There is no other way for a man to find access to the peace of God but through Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Ndipo Yesu aliwaambia uhusiano kati yYake na Baba na jinsi gani wanaungana kwa umoja. Ukimjua na kumwona Yesu, ndipo utamjua na kumwona Baba kwasababu ni wamoja katika kusudi na asili. Yesu alieleza sura ya Baba {Heb. 1:3  Mat. 11:27}, akimaanisha kuwa Baba hawezi kujifunua mwenyewe kimwili kwa mwanadamu, bali Mungu aliweza kujitokeza kama mtu lakini alifanya hivyo kupitia mwana wa mtu. Yesu hakusema au kufanya kitu chochote mpaka Baba alipomwambia kusema au kufanya {Yoh. 5:19;  Yoh. 8:28}.   Jesus then told them of the relation between Him and the Father and how they are united in one. If they knew and saw Jesus, then they knew and saw the Father because they were one in purpose and nature. Jesus is the express image of the Father (Heb. 1:3; Matt. 11:27), which means that the Father never physically reveals Himself to man, but when God does appear to man, He does it through the person of the Son. Jesus did not say or do anything unless the Father told Him to say or do it (John 5:19; John 8:28).</p>
<p>Aliwaambia tena wanapaswa kumwamini Yeye kwasababu ya umoja huu na Baba, ndipo wangeweza pia kumjua mwana. Tangu kama mtu alimjua Baba kweli, ndipo angeweza kumjua Mwana pia. Kama hawatamwamini Yeye kwasababu ya mamlaka, wangemwamini hata kwa kazi alizozifanya. Hii ni sawa na fumbo alilowaambia Mafarisayo katika Yohana 5:36.  He then told them that they should believe Him because of this unity with the Father, since if a man truly knew the Father, then he would also know the Son. If they would not believe Him because of that principle, then they should at least believe Him because of the works that He has done. This is similar to the discourse that He told the Pharisees in John 5:36.</p>
<p>Ndipo aliwaambia pia kuwa  kama wangemwamini ndipo angefanya miujiza mikubwa kuliko aliyewahi kuifanya mwenyewe. Yesu aliwaambia kama wangeomba tuu, ndipo angewapa waliokitaka. Kama wangeomba na kuamini, ndipo wangeona mambo makuu mengi yakitimizwa.  He then told them that if they would believe then they would do greater miracles than even He Himself had done. Jesus told them that if they would only ask, then He would give them what ever they requested. If we would ask and believe, then we can see many mighty things accomplished.</p>
<h2>Yesu alithibitisha kwao ni mtoaji wa pumziko hili 14:15-31 Jesus Affirmed to Them the Giver of this Rest 14:15-31</h2>
<p>Ingawa Yesu aliondoka kimwili duniani hakuwaacha wanafunzi wake peke yao, kwani aliwatumia mfariji, ambaye ni, Roho mtakatifu. Though Jesus was physically leaving the earth He was not leaving His disciples all alone, for He would send to them the Comforter, which is, the Holy Spirit.</p>
