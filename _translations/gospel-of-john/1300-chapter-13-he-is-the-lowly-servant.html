<h1>Sura ya kumi na tatu: Yeye ni mtumishi mdogo  Chapter 13: He is the Lowly Servant</h1>
<p>Katika sura iliyopita tumeona Yesu ametukuzwa kwa sehemu mbili Mungu na Mwanadamu kuwa Mfalme wa Wafalme hiyo ni sifa na heshima ya utukufu wake. Hii haimaanishi kuwa alikuwa jeuri na kiongozi asiyekuwa na huruma hiyo haikuhusishwa na masomo ya maisha yake. Katika sura hii tunamwona mfalme hukaa katika kiti chake cha enzi na kwa unyenyekevu wa watumishi wake tuwafuate watufundishe nasi unyenyekevu kwa kuoshwa miguu yao. In the previous chapter we see Jesus exalted by both God and man to be the King of kings that is worthy of our glory and honor. This does not mean that He is a cruel and un-compassionate ruler that is unconcerned with the lives of His subjects. In this chapter we see the King step off His lofty throne and minister to the humble needs of His followers to teach us a lesson in humility by washing their feet.</p>
<h2>Yesu aliwatawadha Wanafunzi wake miguu 13:1-17. Jesus Washes the Disciples’ Feet 13:1-17</h2>
<p>Siku nne kabla ya Yesu kukaribishwa kwa shangwe katika lango la kuingilia Yerusalemu, ilikuwa ni muda wa kuandaa pasaka. Hii ilikuwa siku ya alhamisi, na sikukuu ilianza wakati wa jua kuzama ilikuwa ni ,mwanzo wa siku ya Kiyahudi huanza wakati wa jua kuzama. Yesu alikuwa na Wanafunzi wake kuandaa chumba cha kuila pasaka {mark 14:12-16} hapo walikuwa tayari wamekaa na kula chakula. Four days after Jesus made His triumphant entry into Jerusalem, it was time to prepare for the Passover. This was a Thursday, and the feast would begin at sundown being that Jewish days began when the sun had set. Jesus had His disciples prepare a room for them to eat the Passover meal (Mark 14:12-16) and now they were settled and ready to eat the meal.</p>
<h3>Sababu ya Yesu kuwatawadha miguu 13:1-5 Jesus’ reason for washing their feet 13:1-5</h3>
<p>Yesu alijua kuwa kabla ya jua kuzama tena kwamba kivuli cha mauti kitamtenganisha Yeye na wanafunzi wake na aliwataka wanafunzi kujua upendo mkuu kwao tena. Hata alifika kwa Yuda ambaye alijua kuwa atamsaliti. Huu ndio upendo ule aliouonyesha kwetu. Yesu hakuonyesha upendo kwanza lakini tulipokuwa wenye haki na tunatembea na Mungu, alifunua upendo wake zamani kabla hatujajua kutubu kwenye madhabahu wakati tulipokuwa tumelaalaniwa, wenye makosa {warum 5:8} Jesus knew that before the sun rose again that the shadow of death would separate Him from His disciples and He wanted them to know of His great love for them once again. He even reached out in love to Judas whom He knew had made a plan to betray Him. This is the same love that He shows to us. Jesus did not first show us love when we were righteous and walking with God, but He revealed His love long before we ever knelt at an altar when we were wretched, miserable sinners (Rom. 5:8).</p>
<p>o Kuwaonyesha upendo wake, alijinyenyekesha mwenyewe hata kufikia kiwango cha utumishi na kuanza kutawadha miguu ya wanafunzi wake, ambaye ilikuwa na vumbi na kuchoka baada ya kusafiri maili nyingi aliweza kufanya hivyo Bwana wao mpendwa. Yesu asingeondoka bila kutuzawadia. Kuna wakati ambapo wafanya kazi waweza kuhofu kwa injili na zaidi kuzimia kwa kuchoka, lakini Yeye hatatuacha pasipo ulinzi, bali atatuongoza katika sehemu ya kupumzika na kuhifadhi nafsi zetu {zab. 23:2, 3}. Yesu alijua kwamba wanafunzi wake watapitia katika nyaakati ngumu na alitaka kuwapa nafasi ya kupumzika na kuijiandaa kwa jaribu kubwa ambalo litawakumba baada ya usiku ule. To show them His love, He humbled Himself to the level of a servant and started to wash the feet of His disciples, which were dusty and tired after traveling many miles in pursuit of their beloved Master. Jesus will not make us toil for His kingdom without rewarding us. There may be times when we labor tremendously for the Gospel and almost faint from exhaustion, but He will not leave us defenseless, but He will lead us to a place of rest and restore our souls (Ps. 23:2, 3). Jesus knew that His disciples had been through hard times and wanted to give them an opportunity to rest and prepare for the greater trials that they would face later that night.</p>
<h3>Petro alikataa kutawadhwa miguu yake na Yesu 13:6-11 Peter’s objection to Jesus washing his feet 13:6-11</h3>
<p>Wakati ulipo fika kwa yesu kutawadha miguu ya Petro, Petro alikataa sana. Alikuwa kama ana heshima kubwa kwa Yesu ambayo Yeye asingeweza mwenyewe kwa mtu mkubwa kama huyu kufanya kibarua cha chini kwake. Yesu alimwambia kuwa bado hajaelewa ni kwanini anawatawadha miguu, lakini kutakuwa na wakati ambapo watajua na kuelewa sababu. Petro bado alikuwa amejikunja na kusema kuwa Yesu huwezi kunitawadha.  When it came time for Jesus to wash Peter’s feet, Peter greatly rejected. He had such a great respect for Jesus that he could not bring himself to let this great Man perform such a lowly task for him. Jesus told him that he might not yet understand why He was washing their feet, but there would come a time when he would know and understand the reason. Perter still would not bend and said that Jesus would never wash his feet.</p>
<p>Yesu alisema kama Petro atakataa nimtawadhe miguu yake ndipo sitakuwa na sehemu kwake. kama tutaunganishwa na Yesu, ndipo tutatawadhwa na Yeye kwanza. Kuna watu wengi ambayo wanataka kujulikana kama Kristo, lakini bado hawamruhusu Mungu kuondoa dhambi katika maisha yao. Petro alikubali na kumwambia Yesu asimtawadhe miguu tuu bali hata kichwa na mikono pia. Yesu alimwambia kwamba akimtawadha miguu yake itatosha kumfanya yeye kuwa safi. Jesus said that if Peter would not let Him wash his feet then he would never have any part with Him. If we are to be joined with Christ, then we must first be cleansed by Him. There are many people that want to be know as Christians, yet they are unwilling to let God remove the filth of sin from their lives. Peter responded and told Jesus then to wash not only his feet, but also his head and hands too. Jesus told Him that washing his feet was enough to make him clean.</p>

<h3>Maelezo ya Yesu ya kuwatawadha miguu yao 13:12-17 Jesus’ explanation of washing their feet 13:12-17</h3>
<p>Wakati Yesu alipomaliza kuwatawadha miguu yao, walikaa kuila pasaka. Kwa ukumbusho wa sura hii na kuigia katika sura ya kumi na nne tunaona Yesu anaelezea baadhi ya maneno ya mwisho kwa wanafunzi wake kama walivyo kaa kuizunguka meza hii. When Jesus was done washing their feet, they set down to eat the Passover meal. Through the remainder of this chapter and the entirety of chapter fourteen we see Jesus explain some last words to His disciples as they sit around this table.</p>
<p>Alianza kwa kuwaeleza sababu ya kuwatawadha miguu yao. Ilikuwa ni kuwaonyesha unyenyekevu. Yeye alikuwa kiongozi wao na mkuu kati yao, na bado Yeye alipaswa kufanya wajibu wa hali ya chini. Alifanya haya kwa mfano kwao, kama Yeye alivyofanya, mkuu, alipaswa kuwa mnyenyekevu, hawatafanya kazi ya mtu fulani wajione wako chini ya zaidi kuliko wao. Lazima waonyeshe unyenyekevu na kufanya kazi ya Mungu hata kama haina utukufu kwa wakati ule hata kama watajisikia kuwa watakuwa muhimu pia kufanya kazi hizo.  He began by explaining the reason He washed their feet. It was to show them His humility. He was their leader and the greatest among them, and yet He was willing to perform the lowest responsibility possible. He did this for their example, for if He, the greatest, was willing to be so humble, then we too should be willing to be humble. Most times when a person gets elevated to a high position, they will not do the work of someone that they feel is less important than them. We must show humility and do the work of God even if it is not glorious at times and even if we feel that we are too important to do such work.</p>
<p>Furaha huja kutoka kwenye unyenyekevu. Yesu aliwaambia kwamba kama watatii hii kanuni ya unyenyekevu ndipo watakuwa na furaha ya kweli. Watu wanao waangalia siku zote watu wengine kupata kazi hawatakuwa na furaha, lakini watu wale wanaohitaji na kuwa na shauku ya kuona atatimiziwa haitajisha ni namna gani ugumu wake au chafu waifanyayo ni wale watu ambaye walifanikiwa katika maisha. Happiness comes from humility. Jesus told them that if they were to obey this principle of humility then they would be truly happy. People that are always looking for other people to get the work done are never happy and content, but people that see the need and are willing to work to see it fulfilled no matter how hard or dirty it may get are the people that are most successful in life.</p>
<h2>Yesu alizungumzia usaliti wa Yuda 13:18-30 Jesus Foretells Judas’ Betrayal 13:18-30</h2>
<p>Yesu tayari ametaja katika mstari wa kumi na moja kuwa alijua kuna mkono wa usaliti kati yao na tunajua kuwa alijua kuwa alikuwa Yuda. Tena alimtoa Yuda nje na kunukuu katika zaburi 41:9, akisema, msri wangu tena niliyemtumaini, aliyekula chakula changu, ameniinulia kisigino chake. Yesu aliwatahadharisha wanafunzi kuwa hataweza kuwasema kila mmoja, lakini alitaka Yuda kujua kuwa alijua anachotaka kukifanya na alimpa nafasi ya kuungama. Katika mstari wa ishirini na moja amewaambia  wazi kuwa anajua miongoni mwao atamsaliti.   Jesus already mentioned in verse eleven that He knew that there was a traitor among them and we know that He knew it was Judas. He again reaches out to Judas and quotes Psalm 41:9, which says, “Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.” Jesus warned the disciples that He was not speaking about all of them, but He also wanted Judas to know that He knew what He had done and was giving him the opportunity to confess. In verse twenty-one He clearly tells them that He knows one of them will betray Him.</p>
<p>Hii iliwatahadharisha wanafunzi. Kwa kile Yesu alichokisema walijua kuwa siyo wote wataomsaliti, lakini yule ambaye atfanya kama atanitaja? Wote wakaanza kuangaliana kwa kila mmoja wakastaajabu ni nani mwenye dhambi kati yetu. Petro alichoshwa kwa kustaajabishwa na alitaka kutoa jibu la moja kwa moja, hivyo alitulizwa na Yohana, ambaye alijifunza toka kwa Yesu. Petro alimwambia wamuulize Yesu alikuwa nani na Yohana alikubali na wakamuuliza Yesu.   This alarmed the disciples. From what Jesus said they knew that not all of them would betray Him, but who was that one that would do such a despicable thing? They all began to look around at each other wondering whom the guilty one was. Peter was tired of wondering and wanted a direct answer, so he beckoned to John, who was leaning on Jesus. Peter told him to ask Jesus who it was and John obeyed and asked Jesus.</p>
<p>Yesu aliwajibu kuwa atakuwa ni yule mmoja ambaye nitampa tonge na mkono wa Yuda ukaenda pamoja na agizo, Huyo ndiyo ndiye. Hapa Yuda alipta nafasi ya mwisho au angemwomba Yesu msamaha au aliweza kufuta tamaa ya mwili wake. Yuda alichagua kutii mawazo ya matakwa yake na kuingiwa na kiburi. Na hiki kiburi kikafungua mlango wa ibilisi kuingia katika maisha yake na kumwangusha, kwa kile alichokifanya. Hatutaweza kuendelea kukataa upendo wa Yesu na kufuata mapenzi yetu wenyewe milele pasipo umakini wa matokeo. Kutakuja wakati ambapo dhambi yeyete ndogo inaweza kuongoza uwe umemilikiwa na ibilisi. Yuda alijikuta amesimama na kuondoka mezani baada ya kuchukua tonge kutoka kwa Yesu. na Jesus answered that it would be the one to whom He gave the piece of bread after He dipped it in the wine. He then dipped the bread and handed it to Judas along with the command, “That thou doest, do quickly.” Judas here was faced with a final opportunity-¬either he could ask Jesus for forgiveness or he could follow the lust of his flesh. Judas chose to obey his baser desires and gave in to his greed. This greed was an open door for the devil to come into his life and take over, which he did. We cannot continually reject the love of Jesus and follow our own will forever without serious consequences. There will come a time when any small sin can lead to a possession of the devil. Judas immediately got up and left the table after he took the bread from Jesus.</p>
<h2>Yesu alitabiri kukanwa na Petro 13:31-38 Jesus Foretells Peter’s Denial 13:31-38</h2>
<p>Baada ya Yuda kuondoka, Yesu aliwaambia wengine kuwa sasa umefika wakati wake wa kutukuzwa. Wanafunzi hawakuelewa alichokuwa anamaanisha. Baadhi yao walifikiri kwamba huu ndiyo ulukuwa muda wa Yesu kuwa kiongozi mtawala juu ya dunia yote na kuwafungua Wayahudi kutoka kwa Warumi. Hawakuelewa kile Yesu alichokuwa anakiongelea kuhusu ni namna gani atakavyokufa, hatakama aliwahi kuwaambia hapo awali. Aliwaambia kitu kilekile alichowaambia Wayahudi, anaondoka na hakuna mtu awezaye kumfuata huko aendekako {mbinguni}. Petro alimuuliza Yesu wapi atakapokwenda, lakini Yesu alimwambia kuwa hawezi kumfuata sasa na wakati unakuja atakayeweza kumfuata. When Judas left, Jesus told the others that now was the time for Him to be glorified. The disciples did not understand what this meant. Some of them might have thought that this was to be the time that Jesus would set Himself up as a ruler over an earthly kingdom and deliver the Jews from the Romans. They did not understand that He was talking about how that He would die, even though He told them before that would.He told them the same thing that He told the Jews, He was going away and they would not be able to follow Him where he was going (heaven). Peter asked Jesus where He was going, but Jesus only told him that he would not be able to follow Him there now and there would come a time when he could follow Him.</p>
<p>Petro alijiona na kujipa moyo kuwa anaweza kumfuata Yesu popote aendeko. Petro alisema kwamba hatakama atakufa kwa ajili ya Yesu Yeye yupo tayari. Yesu alijua kuwa Petro hatatunza ile ahadi na alimwambia Petro kabla ya jogoo kuwika asubuhi mara ya tatu atamkana mara tatu. Kama tusomavyo, neno la Yesu lilithibitika kuwa kweli na tumeona Petro alijiilaani na kuapa kumkataa japo alikuwa anamjua.  Peter objected and insisted that he could and would follow Jesus where ever He went. Peter said that he would even die for Jesus if he had to. Jesus knew that Peter would not keep this promise and He told Peter that before the rooster crowed three times the next morning that he would deny Him three times. As we later read, Jesus’ words proved to be true and we see Peter cursing and swearing to deny that he ever even knew Jesus.</p>
<p>Petro alitaka kufanya haki na kumfuata Yesu, lakini hakuweza katika nguvu zake mwenyewe kama Paulo alivyosema katika Warumi 7:15 kwamba huwezi kufanya kile unachotaka kukifanya. Kuna nguvu katika Mungu iwezayo kupindua kila jaribu, lakini huwezi kuipata popote mpaka uzaliwe tena na kumtegemea Mungu. Tatizo la Petro lilikuwa ni kwamba hakujua madhaifu yake mwenyewe na anahitaji msaada kutoka kwa Mungu. Tunapofikiri tunaweza kufanya kwa nguvu zetu wenyewe hakika tutashindwa, lakini kama tukijua kuwa hatuwezi kufanya wenyewe ndipo tutaona kazi ya Mungu ya ajabu kama tukimwamini Yeye. Peter wanted to do right and follow Jesus, but he could not in his own strength even as Paul said in Romans 7:15 that he could not do what he wanted to do and did that he did not want to do. There is power in God to overcome every temptation, but it cannot be found apart from regeneration and dependance upon God. Peter’s problem was that he did not know his own weakness and his need for help from God. When we think we can make it in our own strength we are sure to fail, but if we know that we cannot do it by ourselves then we can see God work miraculously as we believe Him.</p>
