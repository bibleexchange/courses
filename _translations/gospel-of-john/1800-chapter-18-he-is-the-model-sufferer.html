<h1>Sura ya kumi na nane: Yeye ni mfano wa mateso Chapter 18: He is the Model Sufferer</h1>
<h2>Alisalitiwa na Yuda 18:1-11  Betrayal by Judas 18:1-11</h2>
<p>Baada ya Yesu kumaliza maombi, aliwaongoza wanafunzi wake mpaka kijito cha kedroni katika Bustani ya Gesthsemane. Hiki hakikuwa kitu cha kawaida kwa Yesu kuwarudisha nyuma hapa kuomba na wanafunzi wake na huu ukweli unatufundisha kuwa tusisubiri wakati mgumu kuja kabla hatujaomba, bali tunatakiwa waombaji wakati wote {IThes. 5:17}.  After Jesus finished praying, He led His disciples over the brook Cedron into the Garden of Gethsemane. This was not an unusual thing for Jesus to retreat here to pray with His disciples and this fact teaches us that we cannot just wait for the hard times to come before we pray, but we aways need to be praying (I Thess. 5:17).</p>
<h3>Kukamatwa 18:1-9 The arrest 18:1-9</h3>
<p>Kwasababu kulikuwa na ushabiki mkubwa kumtafuta Yesu hapa hapakuwa na shida kwa Yuda kuweza kuwaongoza viongozi wa Dini ya Kiyahudi kumkamata. Hakuna maandiko katika  Yohana Yuda hakushiriki vibaya kwa Wayahudi kumsaliti Yesu, lakini tumeona akiondoka wa mwisho wakati Yesu anawaambia, "Uyatendayo, yatende upesi" {Yoh. 13:27} sasa tunamwona Yeye anamsaliti Bwana wake .  Because it was so predictable to find Jesus here that it was no problem for Judas to be able to lead the Jewish religious leaders to capture Him. There is no record in John of Judas conspiring with the Jews to betray Jesus, but we only see him leave the Last Supper when Jesus told him, “That thou doest, do quickly” (John 13:27) and now we see him come to betray his master.</p>
<p>Yohana hajatupa kiashiria chochote ni watu wangapi wamekuja na Yuda, lakini tunaweza kuona katika Mathayo 26:47 kwamba ni kundi kubwa. Ilikuwa ajabu kwa askari wengi shujaa kuja kumshambulia mtu ambaye alijulikana kwa amani yake; yawezekana waliogopa kwamba Yesu angewaepuka katikati yao kama alivyofanya awali { Luk 4:28-30; Yohn. 8:59} walitaka kuhakikisha wamemkamata kwa "nguvu". Tunajua kuwa haikuwa idadi wala silaha zao zilizosaidia kumkamata Yesu siku hiyo, bali Mungu alirahisisha mpango wake kutokea, na walifanya hivyo.   John does not give any indication of how many men came with Judas, but we can see from Matthew 26:47 that it was a great multitude. It is strange that so many well armed soldiers came to attack a man that had been known for His peace; perhaps they were afraid that Jesus would escape from the midst of them as He did before (Luke 4:28-30; John 8:59) and they wanted to ensure the capture of their “foe.” We know that it was not their numbers or their weapons that enabled them to capture Jesus that day, but it was simply in the plan of God for it to happen, and so it did.</p>
<p>Yohana anatupa picha ni namna gani Yesu aliwauliza washambulizi wake, "Mnamtafuta nani?" Wakajibu, Yesu wa Nazareti". Yesu alipowaambia hivyo kuwa ni moja wanaomtafuta, hawa watu walirudi nyuma na kuanguka kwa nguvu za Mungu. Yawezekana walishangazwa na udhihirisho wa nguvu za Mungu, hawakumwelewa Yesu kwa haraka na Yesu aliwauliza  tena mnamtafuta nani. Walivyojibu kama walivyojibu mwanzoni, Yesu aliwakumbusha kuwa alijiweka wazi kuwa Yeye alikuwa nani na ni yule waliokuwa na mpango wa kumkamata, wamkamate Yeye na kuwaacha wanafunzi huru. Yesu alikuwa na shauku kuwa wanafunzi wake wamlinde katikati mwa jaribu kama vile walivyokuwa wanajilinda na majaribu hapo awali na hiyo ni kwasababu aliwaombea katika Yohana 17:11, 12 kwamba Baba atawlinda kupitia jina langu.   John gives an exclusive account of how that Jesus asked His attackers, “Whom seek ye?” They answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” When Jesus told them that He was the one they were seeking, then these men were knocked backward to the ground by the power of God. Probably out of amazement at the power manifested, they did not immediately approached Jesus to seize Him and so Jesus again asked them whom they sought. When they responded in the same manner as the first, Jesus reminded them that He clearly told them who He was and that they were planning to capture Him, then they should do so and let His disciples go free. Jesus always had the desire that His disciples should be kept in the midst of this trial as well as any other trial that they would fast later and that is why He prayed in John 17:11, 12 that the Father would keep them through His name.</p>
<h3>Kupigana kwa Petro 18:10, 11 Peter’s resistance 18:10, 11</h3>
<p>Kwa kuona hilio shambulizi, Petro alifanya katika ufidhuli na wala hakufikiri kwamba anaweza kuchukuliwa na kundi lote la askari mwenyewe au alifikiri kuwa hataanguka bila kupigana ndipo alitoa upanga na kumkata sikio la malko, ambaye alikuwa mtumwa wa kuhani mkuu. At seeing this attack, Peter acted in impertinence and either somehow thought that he could take on this whole group of soldiers by himself or he figured that he would not go down without fighting and he took out his sword and cut off the ear of Malcus, who was a servant of the high priest.</p>
<p>Yesu alithibitisha wazi tendo hili na alimwambia Petro arudishe panga, tumeona kotoka Luka kuwa Yesu aliponya sikio la mtumishi huyu { Luk 22:51}. Yesu alimwambia petro alitakiwa akinywee kikombe kile Baba alichomwandalia;  na alikinywea kwa kinywa cha midomo yake kwa mkono wa Baba.    Jesus clearly disapproved of this action and told Peter to put up his sword, and we see from Luke that Jesus healed the ear of this servant (Luke 22:51). Jesus told Peter that He needed to drink the cup that His Father had prepared for Him; He submissively drank the cup of woe pressed to His lips by the Father’s hand. Hebrews 5:8 “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;”</p>
<h2>Jaribu kwa Wayahudi 18:12-14, 19-24 Trial by the Jews 18:12-14, 19-24</h2>
<p>Katika Injili zingine tatu, tunayo maandiko tuu ya Yesu kutokea mbele ya  Kayafa, lakini hapa katika kitabu cha Yohana ameonekana mara moja mbele ya Anasi, aliyekuwa baba mkwe wa Kayafa na aliyekuwa kuhani mkuu kwa wakati ule. Badala ya kuwasikia hawa Wayahudi waili, pia tunafahamu Yesu alijaribiwa na Herode mara moja na Pilato mara mbili.  Yesu alitolewa kwa ajili ya ulimwengu. Hizi zilikuwa ni mbinu za watu wengine ambayo hawakumsadiki Yesu. Maisha ya Yesu, mafundisho na kijinena kulitupwa nyuma na kuangukia katika akili za watu waliokuwa wanataka kuthibitisha kuwa Yeye ni Mwana wa Mungu.   In the other three Gospels, we only have record of Jesus’ appearance before Caiaphas, but here in the book of John we have the singular account of Him appearing before Annas, who was the father in law of Caiaphas and who had previously been high priest. Besides these two Jewish hearings, we also know that Jesus was tried by Herod once and Pilate twice. Jesus was tossed about by the world. This is a tactic of men seeking help from others to disprove Jesus. Jesus’ life, doctrine and claims were cast back and forth in the minds of men who were seeking proof that He was not the Son of God.</p>
<p>Kulikuwa na baadhi ya mijadala kuhusu yule kuhani mkuu aliyesimama mbele ya Yesu katika mstari wa 19-23. Kama tafasiri ya  stari wa 24 imechukuliwa kuwa sahihi tunaweza kusema haya mazungumzo yalikuwa baada ya Kayafa, "Anasi yeye alitumwa kumfunga kwa Kayafa kuhani mkuu," Kama hii itachukuliwa kuwa ni kweli, ndipo hatutakuwa na habari zaidi ya kile kilichotokea wakati Yesu alipokuwa kwa Anasi. Baadhi wanaamini kuwa Anasi hakutaka kumsikia Yesu na alimpeleka kwa mkwewe haraka. Kuna wengine wanaosema mstari ulitafsiriwa kwa usahihi zaidi, "Sasa Anasi anamtuma..." Na mazungumzo haya hasahasa yalikuwa kabla ya Yesu kwenda kwa Kayafa. Mistari hii ilipoonekana ni ya pekee katika kitabu cha Yohana, ndipo inaweza kudhaniwa ni ya mtu, Anasi, ambaye ni mtu pekee katika kitabu. Au yawezekana kesi ikawa ni nani aliyeuliza maswali hay kwa Yesu sio muhimu na Yesu alijibu wapi maswali.   There is some debate about whom the high priest is that is confronting Jesus in verses 19-23. If the translation of verse 24 is taken to be correct, then it is assumed that this conversation is with Caiaphas after, “Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.” If this is taken as true, then we have no details of what happened when Jesus was before Annas. Some believe that Annas did not even want to have a hearing with Jesus and immediately sent Him to his son in law. There are others that say the verse should have been more accurately translated, “Now Annas sent him...” and that this conversation was actually before Jesus went to Caiaphas. Since the content of these verses is unique to the book of John, then it is possible for it to be attributed to the man, Annas, who is also unique to the book. Either case is possible and who asked these questions to Jesus is not as important as what Jesus’ answers were.</p>
<p>Katika Injili zingine tunaona Yesu hayuko peke yake mbele ya Kayafa, lakini pia Sanhedrin pia alikuwepo { Mat. 26:27; Mark. 14:53; Luk 22:66}. Tunajaribu kupata ushahidi wa pande mbili zinazokubaliana { Mat. 26:59-61; Mark 14:55-59}. Ingawa hakuna pande mbili zilizokubaliana, Kayafa alimuuliza Yesu atasema nini kuhusu mashitaka yake yote, lakini Yesu hakutoa jibu lolote. Kayafa alimuuliza moja kwa moja kama Yeye ni mwana wa Mungu na Yesu alimwambia umeongea sahihi yule alikuwa Mwana wa Mungu. Kayafa alikasirishwa na hili na aliraru vazi lake. Hii ilikuwa ni sehemu ya matendo ya Wayahudi kwa kutubu {II Sam 13:31; Ezr. 9:5}. Alitangaza kwasababu Yesu anajitangaza mwenyewe kuwa Yeye ni mwana wa Mungu, mnataka tumfanye nini kwa kutukufuru, ndipo hawakutaka ushahidi zaidi. Walimpeleka Yesu kwa Pilato ili ahukumiwe kwa sheria za Kirumi.    From the other Gospels we see that Jesus was not alone before Caiaphas, but the Sanhedrin was also present (Matt. 26:57; Mark 14:53; Luke 22:66) and that they tried in vain to find two witnesses to agree against Him (Matthew 26:59-61; Mark 14:55-59). Though no two witnesses could agree, Caiaphas asked Jesus what He had to say about all the accusations, but Jesus did not give him an answer. Caiaphas then asked Him directly if He was the Son of God and Jesus told him that he spoke correctly and that He was the Son of God. Caiaphas was enraged at this and rent his garment. This was a part of the Jewish act of repentance (II Sam. 13:31; Ezra 9:5). He declared that because Jesus Himself proclaimed that He was the Son of God, which they thought to be an act of blasphemy, then they did not need any more witnesses. He then sent Jesus to Pilate to be judged by Roman law.</p>
<h2>Alikanwa na Petro 18:15-18, 25-27 Denial by Peter 18:15-18, 25-27</h2>
<p>Petro alikuwa na ujasiri sana kwenye mlo mwisho kuwa hawezi kumkana Yesu na hata kufa atamfuata ndio maana alichukua kile alichokuwa nacho {Yoh. 14: 36}, lakini tulimwona Petro aliogopa kupoteza maisha yake kwa kuhusishwa pamoja na Yesu kwa kuwa alimwogopa yule binti mdogo mfanya kazi na akamkana Yesu mara tatu. Tatizo ni kwamba Petro alitegemea mwili wake na uwezo wake, ambaye mara zote hushindwa kukabiliana na mateso { Ayu 8:13, 14}. Daima tunaweza kuwa katika sehemu ya ushindi na mafanikio kama tukitegemea nguvu za Mungu {IIKor. 2:14}.  Peter was so confident at the Last Supper that he would never deny Jesus and that he would even die following Him if that would be what it would take (John 14:36), but we see Peter so afraid that he would loose his life by being associated with Jesus that he was fearful of a little servant girl and he denied Jesus three times. The problem is that Peter was relying on his flesh and his own ability, which will always fail in the face of sever persecution (Job 8:13, 14). We can always be in the place of victory and success if we depend on the power of God (II Cor. 2:14).</p>
<h3>Kosa la kwanza 18:15-18 The first offense 18:15-18</h3>
<p>Petro na Yohana walimfuata Yesu kwa umbali. Wakiwaangalia Wayahudi wakimpeleka katika nyumba ya kuhani mkuu. Inavyoonekana Yohana alikuwa na uhusiano kwa kuhani mkuu na aliamua kuingia katika nyumba ya mfalme, lakini Petro alimsubiri Yohana aliyeingia ndani na kuzungumza na yule mwanamke mdogo alikuwa anangoja mlango. Binti alimtambua Petro na kumuuliza kama ni mojawapo wa wanafunzi wa Yesu. Petro alimkana ndipo akajiunga na wengine kama ameshikwa na baridi na kuzunguka na wale waliokuwa wakiota moto  Peter and John followed Jesus from a distance. They watched the Jews bring Him to the house of the high priest. John apparently had some relation to the high priest and was granted entrance into the palace, but Peter waited until John went in and spoke to the young woman that kept the door. The girl recognized Peter and asked if he was one of Jesus’ disciples. Peter denied it and then joined some others as they warmed themselves around a fire.</p>
<h3>Kosa la pili 18:25 The second offense 18:25</h3>
<p>Mathayo na Marko wamenukuu shitaka linalofuata juu Petro alilolifanya kwa mwanamke, lakini luka anaeleza kuwa alikuwa mwanadamu. Hii inapendwa sana kwasababu yalikuwa ni mazungumzo ya kundi kati ya wale waliokuwa wakiuzunguka moto na kulikuwa na watu baadhi waliokuwa wakimuuliza Petro maswali. Yohana anakubaliana na kanuni kwa kusema "wali" badala ya mwanaume au mwanamke Matthew and Mark record that the next accusation against Peter was made by a woman, but Luke states that it was a man. This is likely because it was a group conversation among those around the fire and there were several people that made questions to Peter. John agrees with this theory by stating “they” instead of either a man or woman.</p>
<h3>Kosa la tatu 18:26, 27 The third offense 18:26, 27</h3>
<p>Petro hakugundulika siri yake kirahisi ukanaji wake , kwa tamko lake walitambua ni Mgalilaya. Kulikuwa na mtu pale aliyekuwa ndudu wa Malko, ambaye petro alimkata sikio lake bustanini. Petro alikasirika kwasababu watu wote hawa walimtambua kwamba ni moja wa wale kumi na mbili. Yawezekana alikuwa anamwogopa Kayafa kumsikia lakini alijaribu kufa pamoja na Yesu. Alikasirika sana hata alianza kulaani na kuapa kwamba hata hamjui. Peter could not cover his secret by his simple denials, for his accent was certainly that of a Galilaean. There was also a man present that was a relative of Malchus, whose ear Peter had cut off in the garden. Peter got angry because of all these people that recognized that he was one of the twelve. He was probably afraid that Caiaphas would hear of it and that he too would be tried and die along with Jesus. He was so angry that he began to curse and swear that he never even knew Jesus.</p>
<p>Kitambo tu baada ya maneno yatokayo katika mdomo wa Petro, sauti ikasikika kwa mbali ilikuwa sauti ya jogoo kuwika. Petro alikumbuka maneno Yesu aliyemwambia na jinsi gani unabii utakaotokea kama hivi. Akawa na mawzo sana na alitoka akilia kwa uchungu {Luk. 22:62}. Haya yalikuwa matendo sawa na yale ya Yuda alipotambua kile alichokifanya { Mat. 27:3, 4}, bali walienda katika utengano wa uelekeo katika mwanzo wao wa kulia. Yuda aliondoka na kwenda kujinyonga { Mat. 27:5}, lakini Petro aliondoka na kutubu kweli. Waweza kukosa mara kadhaa na kumwangusha Mungu, bali tusikate tamaa kuna nguvu itakayotulinda na kutuamsha tena {Mith. 24:16}.      As soon as these curses had flown from Peter’s mouth, a sound was heard in the distance--it was the sound of the rooster crowing. Peter remembered the words that Jesus told him and how He prophesied that it would happen exactly like this. The thoughts were too much for him to bear and he ran out weeping bitterly (Luke 22:62). This was the same as the actions of Judas when he realized what he had done (Matt. 27:3, 4), but they went in separate directions after this initial weeping. Judas went out and hung himself (Matt. 27:5) but Peter went out and truly repented. There may be times when we make mistakes and fail God, but we should not give up for God has the power to restore us and help us get up again (Prov. 24:16).</p>
