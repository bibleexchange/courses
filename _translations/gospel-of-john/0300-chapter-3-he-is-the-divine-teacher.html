<h1>Sura yaChapter 3: Yeye ni mwalimu wa kiunguHe is the Divine Teacher</h1>
<p>Kokote kwenye hatua za wakati wayahudi walizoezwa kwenye njia ya kishule kama sehemu ya maisha.Kulingana na Kamusi ya uinjilist ya Bakera,katika mila ya kiyahudi kwa wakati wa Kristo watoto wa kiume kati ya miaka tano na ishirini kwa kawaida walihudhuria kwenye shule za Sinagogi na walifundishwa Torati,Mishana,Talimud.Katika hali hii njema ya msisitizo wenye nguvu juu ya elimu,ndio njia ya asili ambayo pia ilisisitiza wenye umuhimu wa wenye elimu--kama inavyoweza kuoneka kwasababu Talmud kwa kurudiarudia hurejesha umuhimu wa mwalimu katika mchakato wa kujifunza.Tunaona kutoka kwa Luka 20:46 kwamba walimu hawa wa kidini walikuwa wakiheshimiwa kabisa na mtu wa wastani(waandishi walitajwa kipekee katika kifungu,lakini bila shaka marabi pia walishiki angalau kiasi fulani katika heshima hii).Ingawa mwanaume alikuwa amezoezwa katika walimu wa asili,walikuwa bado hawaja hesabiwa kama walimu wa kiungu Yesu Kristo.Ujuzi wake ulikuwa haujakuzwa na wakufunzi wala kujifunza kitabu,bali ilikuwa imewekwa maalumu ndani yake kwakuwa yeye alikuwa mwana wa Mungu anayejua yote.Ilikuwa ni elimu hii ya juu ambayo ilimfanya kuwa mwalimu mkuu siku zote.</p>Throughout the stages of time the Jewish people had been accustomed to the scholastic way as a part of life. According to Baker’s Evangelical Dictionary, in Jewish culture around the time of Christ “male children between the ages of five and twenty usually attended synagogue schools and were trained in the Torah, the Mishnah, and the Talmud.” In this atmosphere of strong emphasis on education, it is only natural that there should also be strong emphasis on educators--as can be seen because the Talmud (Avot) repeatedly reinstates the importance of the teacher in this learning process. We see from Luke 20:46 that these religious teachers were quite respected by the average person (Scribes are specifically mentioned in the passage, but without doubt the Rabbis shared in at least some of this respect). Though man had been accustomed to the natural teachers, they had not yet encountered the divine teacher--Jesus Christ. His knowledge was not acquired by lectures and book learning, but it was ingrained in Him for He was the omniscient Son of God. It was this supreme knowledge that made Him the greatest teacher ever.</p>
<h2>Mjadala kwa Nikodemo 3:1-21 Interview with Nicodemus 3:1-21</h2>
<h3>Yesu na Nikodemo "Ana kwa Ana 3:1-3. Jesus &amp; Nicodemus—Face to Face 3:1-3</h3>
<p>Hakuna habariya Yesu kukusanya watu kuhubiri kabla ya Yohana sura ya tatu, lakini inasadikika kwamba aliwahi kufanya alipata heshima ya kuwa mwalimu alitumwa toka kwa Mungu na kulikuwa na heshima hii usiku mmoja kumtokea mtu jina lake Nikodemo akimuuliza maswali. Nikodemo alikuwa mtu mwenye nafasi katika jamii yake "Alikuwa anarejelewa kama mtu wa Mafarisayo, kiongozi wa Wayahudi {Yohana 3:1} na mkuu {au mwalimu; mwelekezaji} wa Israeli {Yoh. 3:10}. Tunaona Yeye anakamilisha sheria kama kiongozi wa dini katika Yohana sura ya saba aliposhiriki katika baraza la mkutano wa Mafarisayo {Yoh. 7:45-52] There is no record of Jesus publicly teaching before John chapter three, but it can be assumed that He did for He had gained a reputation of being “a teacher sent from God” and it was this reputation that one night drew a man named Nicodemus to ask Him questions. Nicodemus was a man of position in his community—he was referred to as a man of the Pharisees, a ruler of the Jews (John 3:1) and a master (or teacher; instructor) of Israel (John 3:10). We see him fulfill the role as a religious leader in John chapter seven where he participates in a council meeting of the Pharisees (John 7:45-52).</p>
<p>Wengi wanaamini Nikodemo alikuja kumtokea Yesu usiku kwasababu aliogopa mateso kutoka kwa marafiki zake viongozi wa dini {ulinganifu huu ni kweli pande zote mbili katika Yohana 7:50-51 na 19:39 ambayo ni wazi kwamba alimwamini Yesu, lakini bado alikuwa hajaweka maungamo wazi}, ingawa wengine alijiuliza yapata mwezi mzima muda ambayo akimwendea Yesu na wakati huo alikuwa akijificha usiku na alikuwa hajihusishi wakati watu wamemuona akiwa na Yesu au alienda pale tu akiwa na nafasina makutano wakiwa wamelala. Mara zote tatu wakati Nikodemo anatajwa katika Maandiko hii ni kweli kwamba alienda usiku kwa Yesu kama ilivyotajwa; hii inaongeza msisitizo kwa ukweli huu kuunga mkono kanuni kwamba aliogopa kuonekana kwa manufaa ingawa kanuni zingine zingewezekana. Most believe that Nicodemus came to Jesus by night because he was afraid of persecution from his fellow religious leaders (this coincides with the fact that in both John 7:50-51 and 19:39 that while it is clear that he believed in Jesus, he still did not make a clear public confession), though others argue that it was full moon at the time that he came to Jesus and thus he was not really hidden by the dark and was not concerned with whether people saw him with Jesus or not but that he only came at that time because he had opportunity while the crowds were away sleeping. All three times when Nicodemus is mentioned in Scripture this fact that he came by night to Jesus is mentioned; this added emphasis to this fact gives support to the theory that he did it out of fear of being seen rather than convenience, though the other theory is still possible.</p>
<p>; udhihirisho huu wa shauku yake ni kumjua Yesu. Alitambulisha kwake kwa heshima kwa kumwita Rabbi, maana yake ni mkuu wangu na na alitumia kama jina la heshima. Aliendelea mbele na kusema, tunajua kwamba wewe ni mwalimu unatoka kwa Mungu: hakuna mtu awezaye kufanya miujiza hii unayeifanya wewe, isipokuwa Mungu yu pamoja nawe {Yoh. 3:1}. Jambo hili alilolisema *Tu* badala ya *Ni* inaonyesha kwamba angalau mtu moja mwingine aamini kwa Nikodemo ambaye pia aliamini kwamba Yesu alikuwa mwalimu kutoka kwa Mungu {John Wesley anaamini kwamba inaweza kuwa hata kwa viongozi wengine na Mafarisayo}. Ingawa haijaelezwa katika Maaniko, inawezekana kwamba hawa watu wengine wangeweza kumchagu hata Nikodemo kuwa msemaji wa kutafuta ukweli wa Yesu. Nikodemo yawezekana alienda kwa hofu, lakini pamoja alienda hili jambo ni kweli--- aliweza kuja Nicodemus may have come in fear, but however he came this fact is true--he did come; this reveals his desire to know Jesus. He addressed Him with respect by calling Him Rabbi, which means my master and is used as title of honor. He continued on and said, “We know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him” (John 3:2). The fact that he said “we” instead of “I” indicates that at least one other person had confided with Nicodemus that they also believed that Jesus was a teacher from God (John Wesley believed that it might have even been other leaders and Pharisees). Although it is not explained in the Scripture, it is possible that these other people may have even elected Nicodemus to be the spokes person to find out if Jesus was real.</p>
<p>Nikodemo alijua kuwa Yesu anaweza kufanya miujiza "hii inavutia kwasababu mpaka kipindi hiki kuna habari moja tu ya muujiza mmoja ambayo Yesu aliufanya. Inawezekana kwamba Nikodemo aliwahi kusikia habari nzuri mno ya kile Yesu aliyofanya au pia alivyo wekewa Yesu ubatizo wa utukufu na shangwe hekalu kusafishwa kama muujiza uliofanywa kwake. Miujiza hii ilitosha kuthibitisha kukiri kwake kwamba Yesu alitumwa na Mungu. Jambo ambalo Nikodemo aliliamini kuwa Yesu alikuwa mwalimu aliyetumwa na Mungu haimaanishi kwamba alitambua kwamba Yesu ni Mwana halali wa Mungu; alikuwa anamlinganisha Yesu kwa hai
li ya juu au chini tu kwa nabii au miungu mingine ya Mungu. Ufahamu wake ulikuwa bado haujafunguliwa juu ya milki ya kiroho na hivyo alikuwa anajaribu kumfananisha Yesu ni mtu wa namna gani kulingana na uelewa wake wa asili. Yesu akajibu maneno ya Nikodemo yalikuwa, Amin, Amin, nakwambia, mtu asipo zaliwa mara ya pili, hawezi kuona ufalme wa Mungu.  Yesu alijua upofu wa Nikodemo kwa ulimwengu wa kiroho na kumwambia moja ya kitu na shauri pekee "kuzaliwa kiroho. Nicodemus knew that Jesus had performed miracles—this is interesting because until this time there is only record of one miracle that Jesus performed. It is possible that Nicodemus had heard exaggerated rumors of what Jesus had done or else he attributed Jesus’ glorious baptism and triumphant cleansing of the temple as miracles performed by Him. These miracles were enough proof for him to acknowledge that Jesus was sent by God. The fact that Nicodemus believed that Jesus was a teacher sent by God does not mean that he realized that Jesus was actually the Son of God; he was more or less only comparing Jesus to a prophet or other oracle of God. His mind had not yet been opened up to the spiritual realm and was thus trying to figure out who Jesus was according to what he understood in the natural realm. Jesus’ response to Nicodemus’ statement was, “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Jesus knew of Nicodemus’ blindness to the spiritual world and told him of the one and only remedy—spiritual birth.</p>
<h3Yesu na Nikodemo; "Dhamira kwa Dhamira 3:4-12.  Jesus &amp; Nicodemus—Mind to Mind 3:4-12</h3>
<p>Nikodemo aliambiwa maneno nhaya kwa fumbo; alifikiri kwamba Yesu anataka aingie tena tumboni kwa mama yake na kuzaliwa tena kimwili. Alikuwa sahihi kuwa mtu wa mwilini hawezi kuzaliwa tena, lakini ni nini hakuitambua kuwa yule mtu wa rohoni anaweza kuzaliwa tena "anaweza kukamilisha uongofu. Huu uongofu [kuzaliwa pili] inachukua nafasi tu kwa maji {Neno la Mungu "Zab. 119:9; efe. 5:26} na roho. Lazima uelewe kwamba kilichozaliwa na mwili ni mwili; na kilichozaliwa na roho ni roho; Ni kwamba, kuna tofauti kuu kati ya vile tunavyo viona katika ulimwengu wa mwilini na vile katika ulimwengu wa rohoni.  Nicodemus was puzzled by this response; he thought that Jesus wanted him to crawl inside of his mother’s womb and be born again naturally. He was right that the physical man could not be born again, but what he did not realize was that the spiritual man can be born again—he can be completely regenerated. This regeneration only takes place by the water (the Word of God—Psalm 119:9; Eph. 5:26) and the Spirit. You must understand “that which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;” That is, there is a significant difference between what we see in the physical world and that that is in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Sasa tunaona Yesu anampa Nikodemo maelezo mazuri katika mstari wa nane "huwezi kuelewa upepo uvumao, bali itii sheria na kuifuata; kwa mambo ya rohoni. Usiahirishe kuzaliwa upya kwasababu ya kupambana kisomi. Tii sheria ya upepo, na upepo utakutii wewe. Tii sheria ya roho, na utajua kuzaliwa upya. Kwa maelezo haya Nikodemo alionyesha kutokuamini kama alivyosema, Hivi vitu ni vya namna gani? Yeye alikuwa mtu ambaye alikuwa anafundisha njia zote za dini, ajuaye amri za sheria zote na manabii, walisikia ahadi zote za Mungu, na walikuwa wazuri sana kushika mistari yote katika vitu hivi alikuwa mwalimu wao lakini bado hakujua maana halisi kwa ujumla. Kama Yesu alivyosema, alipokealakini sio mashahidi wetu {3:11}.  Huu ni mfano safi kwamba dini pekee haiwezi kuokoa mtu. Yesu alitumia mfano hai wa asili wa upepo kuelezea maisha katika hali ya kiroho na Nikodemo hakuelewa;  Yesu alijua kwamba kama nikimwambia vitu vya mbinguni ndipo hatanielewa kwa kweli.  Now we see Jesus give Nicodemus a beautiful illustration in verse eight—You cannot understand the blowing of the wind, but you obey the law and gain its force; so it is with the Spirit. Do not postpone the new birth experience because of intellectual struggle. Obey the law of the wind, and the wind obeys you. Obey the law of the Spirit, and you will know the new birth. To this illustration Nicodemus again displayed unbelief as he said, “How can these things be?” He was a man that had been taught all the ways of religion, knew of all the commandments of the law and prophets, heard all the promises of God, and was well versed in all of these things enough to be a teacher of them and yet he still did not know the true meaning of it all. As Jesus said, he “receive[d] not our witness” (3:11). This is pure evidence that religion alone is not enough to save a man. Jesus used the natural illustration of wind to explain the life in the Spirit and Nicodemus did not understand; Jesus knew that if He outright told Him of heavenly things then he definitely would not understand.</p>
<h3>Yesu na Nikodemol "Moyo kwa Moyo3:13-21. Jesus &amp; Nicodemus—Heart to Heart 3:13-21</h3>
<p>Mwalimu mzuri hujaribu kusaidia wanafunzi wake kuelewa kile anachokisema hata kwa kutumia jitihada zake za ziada. Yesu alijua kuwa Nikodemo hakuelewa siri zote za mbinguni, na bado hakuwa na upendo aliendelea kumuelezea mpango wa wokovu akitegemea kwamba atatambua kuwa kitu kitakacho fungua ufahamu wake ni sawa na kile kilichomfanya akazungumza.  A good teacher will try to help His pupil to understand what he is saying even though it may take some extra effort. Jesus knew that Nicodemus could not fully understand the secrets of heaven, and yet out of love He continued to explain to him the plan of salvation hoping that Nicodemus would realize that the One that could open up his understanding was the same One to whom he was speaking.</p>
<p>Yesu anaelezea wokovu unakujaje kwa mtu --- sio kwa kazi au dini, ila unashuka kutoka mbinguni. Jesus explains how salvation comes to a man--it is not by works or religion, but it came down from heaven.</p>
<p>Kutokana na habari hii hatujaona Nikodemo anaambiwa nini mwishoni kuhusu mausia juu ya wokovu na Yesu, lakini mbele ya habari inayotajwa kwenye Yohana 7:50-51 na 19:39 ile mara zote imetulia kwamba Nikodemo angalau kwa sehemu ameishika kwamba Yesu ni alikuwa Mwana wa Mungu "Mwalimu wa KiUngu yeye peke yake ajuaye Maneno ya uzima wa milele. From this passage we do not see what Nicodemus’ final response was to Jesus’ exhortation on salvation, but from the afore mentioned passages of John 7:50-51 and 19:39 that it is quite obvious that Nicodemus at least partially grasped that Jesus was the Son of God—the Divine Teacher who alone knows the Words of eternal life.</p>
<h2>Kibali kutoka Yohana 3:22-36. Endorsement from John 3:22-36</h2>
<p>Baada ya Yesu kumtubisha Nikodemo aliondoka mjini Yerusalem katika yuda na alienda na Wanafunzi wake mpaka nyikani nje kidogo ya mji alipobatiza watu {ndipo wanafunzi wake walibatiza kwa amri yake na mamlaka na hakuwa Yeye mwenyewe "Yohana 4:2}; kwa wakati uleule, Yohana mbatizaji alikuwa akibatiza huko Aenon. Wanafunzi wa Yohana  {watu waliomfahamu Yohana, walimwamini huduma yake,  na walikuwa wanavutiwa na huduma yake} walikuja kwa Yohana na kuuliza kwake kuhusu Yesu. Tunajua wewe peke yako umemshuhudia Kristo na kumtangaza Yeye kuwa ni Mwana kondoo wa Mungu, na bado wanakuudhi kwamba Yesu alimwacha Yohana katika huduma ya ubatizaji. After Jesus’ conversation with Nicodemus He left the city of Jerusalem in Judea and went with His disciples into wilderness outside of the city where He baptized people (though it was actually His disciples that did the baptizing upon His command and authority and not He Himself—John 4:2); at this same time, John the Baptist was baptizing in Aenon. John’s disciples (men that knew John, believed in his ministry, and had been influenced by his ministry) came to John and asked him about Jesus. They knew that John bare witness of Christ and proclaimed Him to be the Lamb of God, and yet they were bothered that Jesus was moving into John’s ministry of baptism.</p>
<p>Yohana aliwatumainishwa kwamba kama Yesu hakupokea nguvu na mamlaka ya kubatiza kutoka mbinguni, Yeye asingeweza hayo yote. Yeye aliwahi kuwakumbusha kwamba {yawezekana wakati anaingia sio katika Yohana 1:20} ambaye hakuwa Kristo bali alikuwa mtangulizi wake. Yohana hakutia wasiwasi kwasababu Kristo alikuja na kuchukua nafasi ya huduma ya Yohana kwa niaba yake mwenyewe, lakini yeye alikuwa na furaha kiasi. alimwelezea kwa mifano ni jinsi mpambe katika harusi huwa na furaha wakati bwana harusi anakuja kwa bibi arusi yeye hajabadilisha mtazamo na umakini haupo kwao, bali ni furaha ya baraka kuu ile ya kujikuta wawili. Furaha ya Yohana inakamilika sasa kwamba Yesu atakuja.  a John reassured them that if Jesus had not received the power and authority to baptize from heaven, then He would not have it at all. He them reminded them that he had already told them (probably on numerous occasions and not just in John 1:20) that he was not the Christ but was only a forerunner of Him. John was not upset because Christ had come and was replacing John’s ministry with His own, but he was rather glad for it. He expressed it with an illustration of how the best man in a wedding is glad when the bridegroom comes for the bride—he is not upset that the focus and attention is not on him, but is rejoicing for the great blessing that has befallen the couple. John’s joy was fulfilled now that Christ had come; He was the One for whom John had spent his whole life looking and proclaiming and now he had come.</p>
<p>Yohana alimtambua kuwa yeye ni mwalimu anatakaye zungumza kuhusu Mungu, na yule Kristo alikuwa mwalimu ambaye alikuwa Mungu. Yohana alijua huduma yake ya ualimu ni ndogo si kama huduma ya Kristo atakaye kuja kukamilisha. Yesu alistahili nafasi hii ya muhtasari katika huduma kwani Yeye alikuwa mkuu kuliko wote yule ashukaye kutoka mbinguni. Yesu alikuwa mwalimu mkuu kuliko wote kama yasemavyo maneno ya Mungu kuwa mtu wa kwanza. Alikuwa hafundishi historia ya yale yaliotokea wala yeye hakutangaza filosofia ya kitakachoweza kutokea, bali yeye alitangaza Neno la Mungu safi lisilochanganywa "lile ambalo lilitokea kwa wakati muafaka. Alipewa vitu vyote mikononi mwake kuwapa watu, na kila mtu atakaye sikia na kuamini mafundisho yake, atapokea uzima wa milele.  John realized that he himself was a teacher who spoke about God, and that Christ was a teacher who was God. John knew his ministry of teaching had to decrease as the ministry of Christ came to fullness. Jesus deserved this place of epitome in ministry for He was the highest One—the One that came down from heaven. Jesus was the greatest teacher for He spoke the Words of God in first person. He was not teaching history of what had happened nor did He pronounce philosophy of what might happen, but He proclaimed the pure unadulterated Word of God—that which was at that very moment happening. He had “all things” given into His hands to give unto men, and if any man would hear and believe His teaching, they would receive eternal life.</p>
