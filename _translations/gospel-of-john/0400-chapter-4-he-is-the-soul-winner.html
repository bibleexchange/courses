<h1>Sura yaChapter 4: Yeye ni mshindi wa NafsiHe is the Soul Winner</h1>
<h2>Yesu alishinda nafsi ya mwanamke kisimaniJesus Won the Soul of the Woman at the Well 4:1-30</h2>
<p>Yesu na wanafunzi wake waliondoka Yudea na walifanya safari kwenda Galilaya.Jesus and His disciples left Judea and made a journey to Galilee. Njia pekee yakuchukuwa kwenye mazoezi juu ya safari hii ya upande wa kaskazini ilikuwa ni kupitia Nchi ya Samaria.The only practical path to take on this journey northward was to go through the country of Samaria. Wasamaria walikuwa ni mababu wa watu walikuwa wamewekwa kwenye hii Nchi na Esarhaddon, The Samaritans were decedents of people that were placed in this land by Esarhaddon, mfalme wa Ashuru kipindi cha utumwa wa Wayahudi huko Ashuru.the king of Assyria during the Assyrian captivity of the Jews. Watu hawa walioana na wayahudi waliokuwa wameachwa nyuma kutunza Nchi.These people intermarried with the Jews that had been left behind to care for the land. Umoja huu uliunda watu wasamaria watu ambao walikuwa nusu wayahudi nusu wamataifa.This union created the Samaritan people—a people that were half-Jew and half-Gentile. Matthew Henry huwarejea kama shotara wote katika damu na katika asili kwasababu wakati walipoachana na sanamu zao za zamani baada ya kuingia katika Nchi,kwa kujitenga tu waliiandikisha dini yao ya kiyahudi.refers to them as “mongrel Jews...both in blood and religion” because while they abandoned their old idolatry after they entered the land, they only partly adopted the Jewish religion. Hapakuwa na shaka ya kitu kigumu kwa ajili ya wayahudi kufanya safari kupitia Nchi hii ya maadui zao na inawezekana baadhi walifanya uchaguzi badala ya kwenda njia ndefu kuzunguka zaidi kuliko kupitia katika Nchi.Sio Yesu tu ambaye hakupita katikati ya Nchi hii kwa sababu ilikuwa ni njia ya kukutania,lakini yeye alijuwa kwamba kulikuwa na nafsi angezisaidia katika inchi hii ya kigeni.</p>
It was no doubt a hard thing for the Jews to have to make the journey through this country of their enemies and it is possible that some made the option instead to go the long way around the country rather than go through it. Jesus did not only go through this country because it was the most convenient path, but He knew that there were souls that He could help in this foreign country.</p>
<h3>Ombi la Yesu kwa ajili maji ya kimwiliJesus’ request for physical water 4:1-12</h3>
<p>Walipokuwa wamefika mji wa Sikari,wanafunzi wake walimwacha na kwenda mjini kununua chakula.Wakati walipokuwa wamekwenda,Yesu ambaye alikuwa ni mtu kamili,alikaa kwenye kisimani ilikupata kupumzika kutoka mchoko wa kimwili.Ijapokuwa alikuwa amechoka kimwili yeye alikuwa bado ana nguvu kiroho na alikuwa zaidi nashauku ya kuwafikia nafsi zilizo potea na kushinda nafsiWhen they came to the city of Sycar, the disciples left Jesus to go into the city and buy some food. While they were gone, Jesus, who was very much man, sat down on the well to get some rest from physical exhaustion. Though He may have been physically tired He was still spiritually strong and was more than eager to reach out to the lost and win a soul.</p>
<p>Mwanamke toka mjini alikuja kuchota maji na Yesu alimuuliza ampatie maji ya kunywa.Ombi hili lilimshangaza mwanamke,kwasababu wayahudi walikuwa kinyume na Wasamaria kwamba wao hawakuwaomba fadhila.Yesu alimwambia mwanamke kama yeye angalijua karama ya Mungu na ninani anayeongea naye angemuomba maji ya uzima.Mwanamke alifikiri kwamba yeye alikuwa anaongelea kuhusu maji ya asili,lakini hakujua kwamba Yesu alikuwa anaongelea kuhusu maji ya kiroho(7:37-39). Mwanamke alitaka kujua kwamba kwa jinsi gani yeye atayachukua maji kutoka kisimani bila chombo chochote cha kuchotea.</p>A woman of the city came to the well to draw water and Jesus asked her to give Him a drink. This request surprised the woman, because the Jews were so against the Samaritans that they did not ask them for favors. Jesus told the woman that if she only knew the gift of God and to whom she was talking to then she would ask Him for living water. The woman thought He was talking about natural water, but she did not know that Jesus was speaking about spiritual water (7:37-39). She wanted to know how He would be able to get the water out of the well without any kind of vessel.</p>
<h3>Ahadi ya Yesu ya maji ya kirohoJesus’ promise of spiritual water 4:13-30</h3>
<h4>Ahadi kwa mwanamke4:13-14</h4>
The Promise to the Woman 4:13-14</h4>
<p>Yesu alitaka mwanamke ajue kwamba maji ya kiroho aliokuanayo kwa ajili ya kumpa yalikuwa bora kuliko maji ya kimwili ambayo angeyapata toka kisimani.Kama tutakuwa watu wakutafuta vitu vya kimwili tu vya Dunia hii kuliko hatutakaa turidhike hatakama tuna nafasi kubwa,lakini kama tutapokea mambo ya kiroho,hayo yataridhisha nafsi zetu nakutufundisha kuridhika na kile tulicho nacho kwa asili(Waf. 4:11; Waebr. 13:5).Wakati Mungu anapotujaza,sio kana kwamba anatupa vitone vichache,bali hutupa mito ya maji ya uzima ikitiririka kutoka nafsini mwetu(7:37; ni. 58:11).</p>
 Jesus wanted the woman to know that the spiritual water that He had to offer was much better than the physical water that she could get from the well. If we only seek after the natural things of this world than we will never be satisfied even though we may have great possessions, but if we receive of the things of the Spirit, then they will satisfy our soul and teach us to be content with the things that we have in the natural (Phil. 4:11; Heb. 13:5). When God fills us, He does not just give us just a few drops, but He gives us rivers of living waters flowing from our soul (7:37; Is. 58:11).</p>
<h4>Ukiri wa mwanamke4:15-19</h4>
The Confession of the Woman 4:15-19</h4>
<p>Mwanamke alikuwa bado anafikiri katika asili na alidhani kwamba Yesu alikuwa na aina fulani </p>The woman was still thinking in the natural and she thought that Jesus hag some kind</p>
<p>ya maji ya kimazingaumbwe ambayo yangemfanya kamwe asione kiu tena.Mwanamke alimuomba haya maji naye alimwambia aende kumwita mme wake.Naye alimjibu Yesu kwamba hana mme.Yesu alimwambia mwanamke kwamba alikuwa sahihi katika kusema hivyo kwamba hana mme kwa wakati huo,lakini kwa wakati uliopita alikuwa na wanaume tano na sasa alikuwa anaishi na mtu ambaye walikuwa hawajaoana.</p>
.of magical water that would make her so she never got thirsty again. She asked Jesus for this water and He told her to go and get her husband. The woman told Jesus that she had no husband. Jesus told the woman that she was correct in saying that she had no husband at that time, but in the past she had fives husbands and now she was living with a man to whom she was not married.</p>
<p>Wakati Yesu alipo muuliza mwanamke kuleta mme wake Yeye alijuwa yote kumhusu.Yeye alikuwa sio kwamba anajaribu habari ya kuthibitisha kuhusu maisha yake,bali yeye alikuwa anatafuta ukiri wa dhambi zake--yeye alikuwa anaonyesha kwamba katika ukahaba.Kabla Mungu hajatusaidia katika dhambi zetu lakini tuikiri(Mith. 28:13; I Yoh 1:9).</p>
KWhen Jesus asked the woman to bring her husband He knew all these things about her. He was not trying to find out information about her life, but He was looking for a confession of her sin--she had to admit that she was living in adultery. Before God can help us with our sin we must first confess it (Pro. 28:13; I John 1:9).</p>
<p>Wakati mwanamke aliposikia yote ambayo Yesu alikuwa amemwambia kuhusu maisha yake,kisha alitangaza kwamba yeye alikuwa ni nabii.Ufunuo wakati ni kazi endelevu.Mungu aweza kukuonyesha sehemu ya kitu kwa wakati moja na kisha baadaye atakufunulia sehemu zingine.Huyu mwanamke alijuwa kwamba Yesu alikuwa Nabii(Mndo 3:19-24),lakini alikuwa bado haja tambua yeye alikuwa Mesiha.</p> When the woman heard Jesus tell her all about her life, then she proclaimed that He was a prophet. Revelation is sometimes a progressive work. God may show you part of a thing at one time and then later He will reveal to you the other pieces. This woman understood that Jesus was a prophet, which is true, for Jesus was the Prophet (Acts 3:19-24), but she did not yet realize that He was the Messiah.</p>
<h4>Hoja ya Mwanamke 4:20-24</h4>
The Argument of the Woman 4:20-24</h4>
<p>Kupitia mwanamke kutambua kwamba Yesu alikuwa Nabii,Alikuwa anajaribu katika ufahamu kupata jinsi gani huyu myahudi aweza kuwa mjumbe wa Mungu.Wasamaria walitumia mlima Grezim kama mahali pa kuabudia,wakati wayahudi waliabudu Yerusalem.Kulikuwa na dini zingine tofauti kati ya wayahudi na wasamaria,na huyu mwanamke alikuwa anashangazwa kwamba jinsi gani Mungu angelimtumia mtu ambaye anaamini kwa utofauti na kile ambacho yeye alifikiria kuwa ni sahihi.</p>Though the woman realized that Jesus was the Prophet, she was trying in her mind to figure out how this Jew could be a messenger of God. The Samaritans used Mt. Gerizim as a place of worship, while the Jews worshipped at Jerusalem. There were certainly other religious differences between the Jews and the Samaritans, and this woman was wondering how God could use a person that believed so differently from what she thought was right.</p>
<p>Yesu alimsaidia mwanamke kufahamu kwamba haijalishi wapi mtu anaabudu--mtu lazima amwabudu Mungu katika roho na katika kweli.Mtu lazima amwabudu Mungu toka moyoni mwake sio tu kutoka akilini hivyo lazima wamwabudu kulingana na ukweli unaopatikana katika Neno la Mungu.</p>Jesus helped the woman to understand that it did not matter where a person worshipped, but how a person worshipped--a person must worship God in spirit and in truth. A person must worship God from his heart and not only from his head and they must worship God according to the truth found in the Word of God.</p>
<h4>Utambuzi wa mwanamkeThe Realization of the Woman 4:25-30</h4>
<p>Mwanamke hakujuwa kihalisi kwamba ni nini cha kuamini kuhusu vitu ambavyo Yesu alikuwa amemwambia,yeye alijaribu kuweka mbali mawazo hayo mpaka baadaye.Yeye alifikiri kwamba siku fulani ya mbali huko mbeleni kwamba Mesiha angekuja na angekuja kufahamisha ukweli kuhusu mambo yote,ikiwa nipamoja na njia sahihi ya kuabudu.Watu wengi hawatafuti katika maandiko na kuomba kwa ajili ya ufunuo ili waweze kufahamu ukweli kuhusiana na mafundisho sahihi ya Biblia.Wanahisi kwamba vitu vingine vinawachanganya katika kuelewa na kwa tutafahamu ukweli tu tutakapo fika mbinguni na kuongea na Mungu ana kwa ana,lakini hatupaswi kusubiri kujifunza ukweli kuhusu mwalimu wa kiuungu aweze kutufunuliwa kweli zote sisi tunapaswa kuwa na juhudi kusikiliza sauti yake.</p>Yesu alimtangazia mwanamke kwamba yeye ni masiha ambae yeye alikuwa akimwongelea.Huyu mwanamke sio tu alikuwa amesikia mtetemo tu katika masikio yake Yesu aliposema,bali kuna kitufulani kiligusa moyoni mwake na kumwambia kwamba kuwa tangazo hili ni lakweli.Kama ilivyokuwa kwa Andrea na Philipo walipookoka,wakati mwanamke huyu aliposema na Yesu jambo la kwanza ambalo alilifanya alikimbia na kuwaambia wengine habari zake.</p>The woman did not really know what to believe about the things that Jesus said those things to her, and she tried to put off dealing with those ideas until a later date. She thought that someday in the far off future that the Messiah would come and He would make known the truth about all things, including the right way to worship. Many people do not want to search out the Scriptures and pray for revelation so that they can understand the truth about certain doctrines of the Bible. They feel that some things are too complicated for us to understand and that we will only know the truth when we get to heaven and speak to God face to face, but we do not have to wait to learn truth for the Divine Teacher can reveal to us all truths is we would only be diligent to listen to His voice.</p>
<p>Jesus proclaimed to the woman that He was this Messiah of whom she spoke. This woman did not only hear the vibrations in her ears when Jesus spoke, but something resonated in her heart that told her that this proclamation was true. Just like when Andrew and Phillip were saved, when this woman encountered Christ, the first thing that she did was run out and tell others about it.</p>
<h2>Yesu aliwataka wanafunzi kushinda nafsi4:31-38</h2>
Jesus Wanted the Disciples to Win Souls 4:31-38</h2>
<p>Wanafunzi walirudi kutoka kijijini wakati Yesu aliposema na huyo mwanamke</p>The disciples returned from the village as Jesus made this proclamation to the</p>
<p>woman. Yawezekana walikuwa wanafikiri vitu kinyume katika fahamu zao kwa sababu ya uraia wa mwanamke,lakini hakuna hata moja wao aliyedhubutu kuongea naye,mwanamke alipoondoka wanafunzi walimtia Yesu moyo kula chakula ambacho walikinunua.Yesu aliwambia kwamba yeye alikuwa na chakula ambacho wao hawakukijua.Yeye alikuwa hazungumzii chakula cha kimwili,bali alikuwa anasemea utoshelevu wake ni kuyafanya mapezi ya Baba.</p>
They were probably thinking negative things in their minds because of the nationality of the woman, but none of then dared to speak them. When the woman left, the disciples encouraged Jesus to eat the food that they brought. Jesus told them that He had meat to eat that they knew not of. He was not speaking about physical food, but He was saying that His satisfaction was doing the will of the Father.</p>
<p>Yawezekana wakati Yesu alipoinua macho aliwaona wasamaria wanakuja kukutana naye hivyo aliwambaia wanafunzi wake inueni macho yenu myaone mashamba; kwamba yamekuwa meupe tayari kwa mavuno.Yesu hakutaka wanafunzi wasubiri hadi wakati mwingine wa tarehe ya mbali kabla ya kuwafikia waliopotea,lakini kulikuwa na nafsi nyingi ambazo zilikuwa tayari kupokea injili kwa wakati huo huo.Yesu alijua kwamba kulikuwa na nafsi zaidi kuliko ambavyo wangefikiwa na wanafunzi kumi na mbili na aliwambia katika Matayo 9:38 kuomba kwamba Mungu aweze kutuma watendakazi wengi katika shamba la mavuno.Yesu hakuwambia walalamike kwa kuwa wengine hawa wasaidii,lakini zaidi waweze kuomba ilikwamba Mungu aweze kufanya kazi katika mioyo yao na kuwapa shauku ya kutoka na kusaidia kazi shambani.</p>It was possibly when Jesus looked up and saw the many Samaritans coming to meet Him that He told the disciples, “Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already unto harvest.” Jesus did not want His disciples to wait until some far off date before they reached out to the lost, but there were many souls ready to receive the Gospel right then. Jesus knew that there were more souls than could be reached by these twelve men and He told them in Matthew 9:38 to pray that God would send more laborers into the harvest field. Jesus did not tell then to complain because others were not helping, but rather to pray that God would work in their hearts and give them the desire to go out and help work in the fields.</p>
<h2>Yesu alishinda nafsi ya Kaisari4:39-42</h2>
Jesus Won the Souls of Sycar 4:39-42</h2>
<p>Kulikuwa na watu wengi waliokuja kwa Yesu kutoka mjini waliposikia ushuhuda wa mwanamke.Walipomsikia Yesu mwenyewe akizungumza waliamini zaidi maneno yake.Ushuhuda wa mwanamke uliwafanya wengi kuja kwa Kristo,lakini hakuwa maneno yake yaliyo badilisha maisha yao.Maneno yake yaliwaongoza kuja kwa Kristo,ambaye ni yeye tu awezaye kumgeuza mtu(4:42).</p>Yesu alishinda nafsi ya mtu mwenye cheo4:43-54</h2>
There were many people that came to Jesus from the city when they heard the testimony of the woman. When they herd Jesus Himself speak they too believed His words. The testimony of the women led many people to Christ, but it was not her words that changed their lives. Her words only led them to Christ, and He is the only One who can transform a man (4:42).</p>
<h2>Jesus Won the Soul of the Nobleman 4:43-54</h2>
<div class="highlights left">
<h1>#3 Bwana wa umbaliMaster of Distance</h1>
	<p>Wakati tunapohitaji kushughulikia shida,huwa inafaa sana sisi kuwa mahali shida ilipo.Mganga hawezi kumsaidia mgonjwa hadi awe karibu na kitanda.Yesu alidhibitisha kwa yeye hakuwekewa kikomo kwa mipaka iliowekwa na umbali aliwahi kumponya kijana ambaye hata hakukaribia mahali alipolazwa.</p>
</div>
When we need to deal with a situation, it is most beneficial for us to be where the problem is. A doctor cannot help a patient unless he is at his bedside. Jesus proved that He is not limited to the boundaries created by distance and healed the boy without ever even stepping in the house where he lay.</p>
</div>
<p>Baada ya siku zake mbili za kuwa samaria,mwishowe Yesu alifika mahali pa Kana ya Galilaya.Alipofika pale kulikuwa na watu tayari ambawo walimwamini kwa watu hawa ambawo walikuwa Yerusalemu wakati alipopindua meza za wabadilisha fedha.Kulikuwa na watu ambawo yamkini walisikia ushuhuda ambawo watu hawa waliwatea.</p>

After His two day detour in Samaria, Jesus finally reached His destination of Cana of Galilee. When He arrived there were already people that believed in Him for these people where at Jerusalem when He overthrew the tables of the money changers. There were other men that probably heard the testimony that these men brought back.</p>

<p>Moja wa watu hawa aliyemwamini Yesu alikuwa ni mtu mwenye cheo kutoka Kaperinaumu ambaye mwanawe alikuwa mahututi kwa ugonjwa.Alisafiri hadi Kana ilikuona kama Yesu angelikuja kumponya mwanawe.Yesu alimwambia mtu aende nyumbani kwakuwa mwanawe angakuwa hai.Na mtu aliamini maneno ya Yesu.</p>One of these men that believed on Jesus was a nobleman from Capernaum that had a son that was dying from a disease. He traveled to Cana to see if Jesus would come and heal his son. Jesus told the man to go home for his son would live. The man believed the words of Jesus.</p>
<p>Vs. 48—Sababu pekee ya Yesu kufanya miujiza ilikuwa kwamba watu waweze kuamini.Hawa walikuwa ni watu wengi walioponywa wakati wa huduma ya Yesu,lakini sio wote walioamini.Wakati kijana huyu alipoponywa,sio baba tu aliyeamini bali nyumba nzima iliamini.</p>

The only reason that Jesus performed miracles was so that people would believe. There were many people that were healed during Jesus’ ministry, but not all of them believed. When this son was healed, not only the father believed but the whole house did.</p>
