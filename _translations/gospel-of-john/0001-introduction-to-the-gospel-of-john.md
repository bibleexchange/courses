# Utangulizi

Ingawa kitabu hiki mara kwa mara hurejewa kama Injili ya Yohana,ingepaswa kufahamika kwamba ni bora kurejewa kama Injili ya Yesu kristo kama ilivyoandikwa Yohana kwa kuwa kitabu ni kuhusu Yesu na sio Yohana.Kitabu cha Yohana sio mafundisho mapya au wazo,bali  kinahusishwa na habari za wandishi wengine wa injili.Though this book is often referred to as the Gospel of John, it should be understood that it is better referred to as the Gospel of Jesus Christ According to John since the book is about Jesus and not John. John’s book is not some new doctrine or idea, but it corresponds with the records of the other Gospel writers.

## Mwandishi wa Injili.The Writer of the Gospel

Injili ya Yohana ilikuwa imeandikwa kati ya mwaka 85 na 90 A.D na Yohana aliyependwa,mwanafunzi wa Yesu.Alizaliwa Betsaida ya Galilaya kwa Zebedayo,mvuvi na Salome ambaye baadhi wanaamini kuwa alikuwa dada yake na Mariamu mama yake Yesu.Alikuwa na angalau kaka moja Yakobo, na wote walijiunga na baba yao katika biashara yake ya samaki.Ilikuwa walipokuwa wakifanya kazi na baba yao ambapo walijibu wito wa Yesu wa kuwafanya wavuvi wa watu na kuwa wanafunzi wake(Mat 4:18-22).Huyu Yohana asichanganywe na Yohana mbatizaji.Yohan hatumii jina lake mwenyewe wakati wa kuandika injili hii;badala yake hujirejea mwenyewe kama mwanafunzi mwingine au mwanafunzi aliyependwa.Kuna ushahidi wa kudumu ambao unaonyesha kwamba Yohana alikuwa mwandishi kama tunavyo weza kuona kutoka Yohana 21:24,25. The Gospel of John was written between A.D. 85 and 90 by John the Beloved, the disciple of Jesus. He was born in Bethsaida of Galilee to Zebedee, a fisherman, and Salome, whom some believe to be the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus. He had at least one brother, James, and they both joined their father in his trade of fishing. It was while they were working with their father that they answered the call of Jesus to be fishers of men and be His disciples (Matthew 4:18-22). This John is not to be confused with John the Baptist. John does not use his own name when writing this gospel; instead he refers to himself as “the other disciple” or “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” There is internal evidence that shows that John was the author as we can see from John 21:24, 25.

Kulingana na Irenos,mwanafunzi wa Polikapi,aliyekuwa rafiki na mwanafunzi wa Yohana,Yohana kwa mdomo alishirikisha injili kwa miaka sita baada ya kupaa kwa Yesu.Kwa wakati huo huo,Yohan alikuwa anahamishwa na Domitian mtawala kirumi,kwenda kisiwa cha patimo kama tendo la mateso ya kidini.Ilikuwa pale Yohana alipo pokea maono yanayo jumuishwa katika kitabu cha Ufunuo.According to Irenaeus, the pupil of Polycarp, who was a friend and pupil of John, John orally shared the Gospel for sixty years after the Acension. At some time, John was exiled by Domitian, the Roman emperor, to the Island of Patmos as an act of religious persecution. It was there that John received the visions included in the book of Revelation.

Irenio pia alisema kwamba baada ya kifo cha Domitian mnamo A.D.96 ambapo Yohana alirudishwa kutoka uhamishoni na kuhamia Efeso.Inaaminiwa kwamba hapo ndio pale ambapo kulikuwa na faraja ya marafiki na mongozo wa Roho Mtakatifu ulimsaidia kuandika injili hii ambayo alikuwa akiihubiri muda mrefu.Karibia kizazi baada ya injili zingine kuwa zimeandikwa,hii injili ilikuwa imeandaliwa,ambayo huonyesha kwamba maisha na kazi ya  Kristo kulikuwa wakati huu unajulikana sana kwa  wakristo.Katika wakati maalum mitume walikuwa wamehubiri injili,Petro na Paulo waliteseka kwa ajili ya imani,na mitume wote walikuwa wamepitia thawabu yao,Na Yerusalemu ilikuwa imeharibiwa na warumi.Clement wa Alexandria (c.150 - c. 215) husema mwisho wa yote,Yohana hushikilia kile ambacho injili za wengine vitu hivyo vilihusianishwa na yale yanayo husishwa na mwili wa Kristo,na kushawishiwa na rafiki zake,vile vile aliongozwa na Roho wa Mungu,aliandika injili ya kiroho. also said that after the death of Domitian in A.D. 96 that John returned from exile and settled in Ephesus. It is believed that it was there that the encouragement of friends and the direction of the Holy Spirit induced him to write this Gospel that he had so long been preaching. Nearly a generation after the other Gospels had been written, this Gospel was prepared, which shows that the life and labors of Christ were at this time well known to Christians. In the meantime, the apostles had preached the Gospel, Paul and Peter had suffered martyrdom, and all the apostles had passed to their reward, and Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans. Clement of Alexandria (c.150 - c. 215) says, “Last of all, John, observing that in the other Gospels those things were related that concerned the body of Christ, and being persuaded by his friends, also moved by the Spirit of God, wrote a spiritual Gospel.”

Irenio aliikubali hii na huu ni uhakika kabisa ambao Yustini mfia dini aliutumia pia.Ulikuwa umeunganishwa na vitabu vingine vya agano jipya katika mateso ya watatiani mnamo 170 A.D.Irenaeus accepted this Gospel and it is quite certain that Justin Martyr used it too. It was combined with the other books of the New Testament in the Diatessaron of Tatian about 170 A.D.

## Kusudi la InjiliThe Purpose of the Gospel

Kusudi la Yohana ni kuonyesha hisia za milele katika injli;John 20:30,31 huelezea kwamba injili ni hesabu ya ishara ambayo ilionyesha kwamba ni Yesu alikuwa ni masihi.Shabaha ya Yohana ilikuwa watu waweze kuwa amini kwa kusoma hesabu iliotoa pamoja na kurasa zake.The purpose of John is stated internally in the Gospel; John 20:30,31 explains that the Gospel is an account of signs that proved that Jesus was the Messiah. The goal of John was that men might believe upon reading the accounts given within its pages.

Kwenye kitabu tunapata mawazo matatu ya ufunguo yaliyo tolewa hapa katika Yohn 20:30,31; mawazo hayo ni ishara,kuamini na uzima.Tunaona ishara nyingi katika kitabu cha Yohana yanayo thibitisha kwamba Yesu alikuwa ni mwana wa Mungu,ishara hizi huzalisha imani(kuamini)katika yeye na kazi zake,na matokeo yalikuwa kwamba wote ambao wangeamini wapate uzima wa milele. Throughout the book we find the three key thoughts given here in John 20:30,31; those thoughts are signs, believing, and life. We see many signs in the book of John that prove that Jesus was the Son of God, these signs produced faith (believing) in Him and His work, and the result was that those that believed received eternal life.

### Injili ilikuwa imeandikwa ili kwamba watu waweze kuona ishaThe Gospel was written that men might see signs

Kupitia kitabu cha Yohana tunaona matukio mengi tofauti yenye nguvu ya asili yaliyotolewa kama ushahidi kwa watu kuamini katika Yesu na kazi zake.Yesu alisema katika Mark 16:17,Isipokua ninyi mnaona ishara na maajabu nanyi hamuamini na kwa hiyo yeye anatoa ishara nyingi kuwatia watu moyo kuamini.Wakati kunauwezekano watu kuamini bila kuona kwanza.Wakati mtu anapoona hizi ishara tendo linahitajiwa ama yeye lazima akubali na kuamini au zaidi lazima akatae na kushakia. Throughout the book of John we see many different supernatural occurrences that are given as evidence for men to believe in Jesus and His work. Jesus said in Mark 16:17, “Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe” and so He gives many signs to encourage men to believe. While it is possible for men to believe without seeing (John 20:29), the fact remains true that most men will not believe without seeing first. When a man sees these signs a action is demanded--either he must accept it and believe or else he must reject it and doubt.

Miujiza ilioandikwa ni ushahidi wa vitu vya kujengea kweli za kiroho.Kuna ishara tisa za kuahirishwa katika Yohana zinazo thibitisha kuwa Yesu ni Bwana vitu ambavyo tunakabiliana kila siku.Yesu alifanya ishara zingine nyingi(Yohana 20:30),Lakini kweli hizi zimechukuliwa kufundishia kweli za kiroho.The miracles recorded are material witnesses to underlying spiritual truths. There are nine distinct signs in John that prove Jesus to be Master of things that we face every day. Jesus performed many other signs (John 20:30), but these signs are hand-picked to teach a spiritual truth.

Ni nini kuhudumia divai kwenye harusi inayofanywa na huduma ya Yesu? nizaidi ya kuhudumia divai kwa ajili ya harusi bali nikuonyesha nguvu ya miujiza ya Mungu.Katika uwezo wake kugeuza masikitiko kuwa furaha pia na ubora wa kazi yake unaonyesha nia ya Mungu iliobora.Ushuhuda ambao mkuu wa karamu alikuwa nao juu ya divai,wewe umetunza divai njema mpaka sasa;What does supplying wine for a marriage have to do with Jesus&apos; mission? It is more than just supplying wine for a wedding, but it is showing the miraculous power of God. In His ability to turn sorrow into joy and also the quality of his work shows that God&apos;s way is best. The testimony that the governor of the feast had about the wine, &nukuuquot;wewe umetunza divai njema mpaka sasa;thou hast kept the good wine until now&quot;.

Ishara hizi humthibisha kuwa ni Bwana.These signs prove Him to be the Master.


### Injili ilikuwa imeandikwa ilikwamba watu waweze kuaminiThe Gospel was written that men might believe

Kuamini ni kutumaini na kibinafsi ni kujikabithi wewe mwenyewe kwa Kristo;au kujilaza kwa Yesu pamoja na kutiwa hatiani.Maneno ambayo yanahusishwa na kuamini(kama vile imani na amini yametumika mara 98 katika Yohana.Believing is to trust and a personally commit yourself to Christ; or relying on Christ with conviction. The words that involve believing (i.e. faith and believe) are used 98 times in John.

kutokuamini.Maandiko kamwe hayahitaji imani pasipo kutoa sababu ya kutosha kwa ajili ya dhamira.Yohana 11:40 inasema kama ungeamini ungeliuona utukufu wa Mungu.Yesu alimpa Marta na wanafunzi wote sababu nyingi za kuamini,ingawa zinaonyesha yeye ni nani kwa ishara nyingi.Bwana wa kila hali alionyesha utoshelevu wake kwa ajili ya dharura zote za binadamu.Ufufuo ulikuwa ni ishara kuu ya yote kwakuwa ulithibitisha kwamba Yesu sio tu alikuwa na uwezo wa kufufua watu wengine kutoka wafu, bali aliweza kujihuisha mwenyewe.The outcome of destiny is determined by belief and unbelief. The scriptures never demand belief without providing adequate reason for commitment. John 11:40 says, “If thou wouldest believe thou wouldest see the glory of God.” Jesus gave Martha and all the disciples many reasons to believe, though demonstrating who He is by many signs. The Master of every situation demonstrated fully His adequacy for all human emergencies. The Resurrection was the crowning sign of all since it proved that Jesus not only had the power to raise other men from the dead, but He was also able to revive Himself.

### Injili ilikuwa imeandikwa ili watu waweze kuwa na uzimaThe Gospel was written that men might have life

Zaidi ya  uzima wa asili,bali ni uzima wa kiroho--uzima wa Kristo.Uzima huu ulirudisha uhusiano kati ya Mungu na mtu(17:3)ambao ulipotezwa wakati Adamu aliposhindwa kumtii Mungu kwa kula tunda lililo katazwa.Kuna rejea nyingi kwa ajili ya huu uzima wa kiroho katika injili ya Yohana,kujumuisha 3:16; 3:36; 4:14; 5:24; 6:47; 8:12; 10:10; 11:25 and 12:25.
WWhen men see the signs and believe in them, then life is given. This life is more than natural life, but it is spiritual life--the life of Christ. This life is a restored fellowship between God and man (17:3), which was lost when Adam disobeyed God by eating the forbidden fruit. There are many references to this spiritual life in the Gospel of John, including 3:16; 3:36; 4:14; 5:24; 6:47; 8:12; 10:10; 11:25 and 12:25.

## Mtindo wa injiliThe Style of the Gospel

Mtindo wa injili ni rahisi,bali wazo ni la kushangaza.Ubunifu wake mkuu ni kupeleka mbele uungu wa Bwana wetu kama msingi wa imani,nakukutana na mahitaji ya kiroho,sio ya kiwango maalumu(kama vile.Wayahudi,Warumi,Wagirki),bali ni kwa watu wote tokea hapo inaitwa injili ya kiroho,na injili kwa ajili ya Kanisa.Gregory Nazianzen anasema (c. 329 – c.390) Matayo aliandika matendo ya ajabu ya Kristo kwa wayahudi,Marko aliandika kwa Warumi,Luka aliandika kwa Wagiriki,Yohana,mhubiri ambaye anafikia mbingu kabisa kwa ajili ya wote.The style of this Gospel is simple, but the thought is profound. Its great design is to set forth the divinity of our Lord as the basis of faith, and to meet the spiritual needs, not of a particular class (i.e. Jew, Roman, or Greek), but of all men and hence it is called “the spiritual Gospel,” and “the Gospel for the Church.” Gregory Nazianzen (c. 329 – c.390) says, “Matthew wrote the wonderful works of Christ for the Jew, Mark for the Roman, Luke for the Greeks, John, a herald, who reaches the very heavens for all.”

Tumesha kumbuka kusudi(bali haya yaliandikwa ili nyinyi mweze kuamini kwamba Yesu ni Kristo,mwana wa Mungu,na katika kuamini mweze kuwa na uzima kwa njia ya jina lake)na hili ni kusudi linalo onyesha mtindo wa injili.Mtazamo wake ni katika kuzalisha imani katika mioyo ya watu hii ndio sababu Yohana haandiki habari nyingi kuhusu maisha ya Kristo,bali zaidi anaangalia wokovu.Kwa mfano,hataji mambo yahusuyo kuzaliwa na maisha ya mwanzoni ya Yesu au ukoo wa familia,badala yake anatangaza mafundisho ya mfano,injili hii inachukua mazungumzo makubwa ya kiroho ambayo hayaonekani katika injili zingine tatu.We have already noted the purpose (But these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through His name) and this purpose shapes the style of the Gospel. It’s focus on producing faith in the heart of men is why John does not record many details of Christ’s life, but rather focuses on salvation. For example, he does not mention the facts concerning the birth and early life of Jesus or a genealogy of His family, but instead declares, “in the beginning was the Word.” This is also why instead of parabolic teaching, this Gospel contains the great spiritual discourses that do not appear in the Synoptic Gospels.
