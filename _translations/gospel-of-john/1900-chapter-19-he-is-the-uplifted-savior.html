<h1>Sura ya kumi na tisa: Yeye ni Mwokozi Aliyeinuliwa Chapter 19: He is the Uplifted Savior</h1>
<p>Katika sura hii tumemwona Yesu kuwa mtiifu hadi kifo, naam mauti ya msalaba. Angewezaweza kudhihirisha nguvu zake kirahi na kujiokoa mwenyewe siku hiyo, lakini kama agejiokoa mwenyewe pia agaelaumiwa kibinadamu. Alijua kwamba kifo chake ni njia pekee ya kulipa dhambi za wanadamu na kuwaweka huiru.  In this chapter we see Jesus become obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. He could have easily manifested His power and saved Himself that day, but if He saved Himself He would have also condemned humanity. He knew that His death was the only way to pay for the sins of men and set them free.</p>
<h2>Maamuzi 18:1-16 The Sentence 18:1-16</h2>
<h3>Mfalme wa Waytahudi ashitakiwa 18;1-6  The King of Jews Accused 18:1-6</h3>
<p>Aliadhibiwa: Yesu alidhihakiwa na kupigwa kwa mijaledi. Huu ulikuwa ukatili, adhabu ya kuumiza mno. Mjeleti ulitengenezwa kwa ngozi ya ugwe, angalau kamba mbili zilizosokotwa, zenye ncha kali au za kuchoma, ili kwamba ziweze kukata nyama kwa ndani. Mikono ya Yesu ilifungwa juu ya mti na walikivika taji kichwa chake. Ilikuwa ni desturi ya Kirumi kwa wafungwa viboko na viongozi hadi anapokaribia kufa { Wayahudi waliruhusia kupiga viboko arobaini tu}. Hapo awali, yawezekana, hakuna alichokifanya zaidi ya kulia machozi kimwili.   Scourging: Jesus was stripped and beaten with a whip. This was a savage, excruciating punishment. The whip was made of leather straps, at least two pieces made of rough lead, sharp bones or spikes, so that they would cut deeply into the flesh. Jesus' hands were tied to a post above His head as He was scourged. It was the Roman custom for the prisoner to be lashed by the presiding centurion until He was near death (Jewish trials allowed only forty lashes). Jesus' back was, of course, nothing more than an unrecognizable mass of torn flesh.</p>
<p>Askari wa Kirumi waliposikia kuwa Yesu alisema alikuwa ni Mfalme wa Wayahudi walitaka kumfanyia mchezo wa kumdhihaki. Walimvika taji ya miba na kumvika vazi la zambarau, ambaye ilikuwa ni rangi ya kifalme. Walimdhihaki na kumpiga wakamwita kwa dhihaka, "habari, mfalme wa Wayahudi1!" Nini hawaikutambua kuwa Yeye alikuwa mfalme wa Wayahudi kweli na zaidi Yeye alikuwa mfalme wa Wafalme { Dan.2:37; I Tim. 6:15; Uf. 17:14}. The Roman soldiers heard that Jesus was supposedly King of the Jews and they wanted to make some sport out of the claim. They made a crown out of braided thorns and put on Him a purple robe, which is the color of royalty. They mocked Him and hit Him as they cried in jest, “Hail, King of the Jews!” What they did not realize that He was in truth the King of the Jews and even more He was the King of Kings (Dan. 2:37; I Tim. 6:15; Rev. 17:14).</p>
<p>Pilato alimleta Yesu mbele ya watu na kutangaza, "Tazama mtu" Kusanyiko, yawezekana kulikuwepo na watu waliosikia Yesu alipokuwa akiongea au walimjua mtu fulani aliyeponywa na Yeye, sasa walimpazia sauti kuwa asulubishwe. Uchaguzi aliojaribu kuufanya ni kumuweka mikononi wa watu wachague watakavyomsulubisha. Pia walipewa uchaguzi...Wanaweza kumkataa au wanaweza kumpokea. Nini walichokifanya kwake?s   Pilate brought Jesus before the people and declared, “Behold the man!” The crowd, which probably consisted of people that had heard Jesus speak or knew someone that had been healed by Him, now cried out for Him to be crucified. The choice of what to do with Him had been put in the hands of the people and they chose to crucify Him.We have also been given a choice--we can reject Him or we can receive Him. What will you do with Him?</p>
<h3>Mwana wa Mungu alikataliwa 18:7-16  The Son of God Refused 18:7-16</h3>
<p>Wayahudi walimwambia Pilato kuwa alijitangaza kuwa ni mwana wa Mungu, na yale matendo ya kumkufuru Mungu kwanini Yeye alistahili kifo. Haya yalimwogopesha Pilato, kwa Yeye kujitangaza kuwa ni mfalme wa Wayudi-- ni kitu tofauti sana kujitangaza mwenyewe kuwa ni mwana wa Mungu. Alimleta Yesu tena katika jengo la hukumu na kumuuliza kama mashitaka ya Wayahudi ni kweli, lakini Yesu hakutoa jibu lolote. pilato alijaribu kumshawishi Yesu aongee kwa kumkumbusha kuwa Yeye ndiye wenye mamlaka ya kuchagua asulibishwe au aachiwe. Yesu alimjibu na kumwambia kuwa hana mamlkaka ya kufanya kitu chochote hata hayo aliyekuwa nayo amepewa na Mungu. Ni lazima tukumbuke kuwa mtukio yote yaliotokea usiku ule ni kwaajili ya mapenzi ya Mungu. Yesu anaenda kufa msalabani si kwasababu watu walichagua awe pale, bali ilitokea kwasababu ni mpango wa Mungu kwa Yesu kufa kwa ajili ya dhambi za wanadamu. The Jews told Pilate that Jesus proclaimed to be the Son of God, and that act of blasphemy was why He was worthy of death. This frightened Pilate, for up to this point he thought that Jesus only proclaimed to be King of the Jews--it was a much different thing to proclaim yourself to be the Son of God. He brought Jesus back into the judgment hall and asked Him if the accusations of the Jews was true, but Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate tried to threaten Jesus into speaking by reminding Him that He had the power to chose to crucify or release Him. Jesus answered and told him that he had no power to do anything unless it was given him by God. We must remember that all the events that happened that night were of the will of God. Jesus was going to die on the cross not because man chose to put Him there, but it happened because it was God’s divine plan for Jesus to die for the sins of man.</p>
<p>Pilato akamleta Yesu mbele ya Wayahudi zaidi ya mara moja kujaribu kuwashawishi kuwa hana hatia, lakini Wayahudi walimsisitiza Pilato kuwa hayuko vizuri katika msimamo wa Kaisari, kama utamwacha Yesu aende, Yesu atajifanya awe mfalme. Hii yawezekana ilimshitua Plato, lakini alikuwa bado akiwataka Wayuhudi kushusha hasira zao kuhusu Yesu. Aliwauliza kama kweli anataka kumsulubisha mfalme wao, walimjibu Kaisari pekee ndiye mfalme wetu. Pilato ukweli aliogopa kushitakiwa kama atajaribu kupindua mamlaka katika nchi ya Kirumi kama atajaribu Yesu zaidi, hivyo alimpeleka mbali asulubiwe. Pilato alimwamini Yesu vikubwa vinginevyo mapigano yasingetokea kiujumla, bali haikuwa imani ya kweli, mbali na hiyo asingejitoa sadaka nafasi yake ya utawala bali uhai wake pia. Pilate brought Jesus before the Jews one more time to try to get them to convince them of His innocence, but the Jews insisted that Pilate would not be in good standing with Caesar if he let Jesus go, for Jesus committed insurrection by making Himself a king. This probably shook Pilate, but he still tried to get the Jews to drop their charges against Jesus. He asked them if they really wanted to crucify their king, and the Jews responded that Caesar alone was their king. Pilate was surly afraid that he would be accused of trying to overthrow the Roman authority in the land if he tried to help Jesus any more, so he sent Him away to be crucified. Pilate believed in Jesus to an extent otherwise he would not have fought for Him at all, but it was not a true faith, for if it was, he would have been willing to sacrifice not only his position as governor, but also his life.</p>
<h2>Kusulubiwa 18:17-30  The Crucifixion 18:17-30</h2>
<h3>Maandishi juu ya msalaba 18:17-24  The inscription on the cross 18:17-24</h3>
<p>Pilato aliandika ishara juu ya msalaba ili kwamba watu wajue kuwa Yeye alikuwa nani na nini "kosa" alilolifanya. Haya maandiko yalisomeka, " Yesu wa Nazareti, Mfalme wa Wayahudi" na aliandika Kiebrania, Kiyunani, na Kilatini ili kwamba kila mtu aliyekuwepo aweze kusoma. Wayahudi waliudhika kwa alama hii na kwenda kwa pilato kumwambia kuwa tunasoma kitu ambacho kinamadhara ya "Yesu wa Nazareti, ambaye anajiita Mfalme wa Wayahudi" tangu hawajawahi kumwamini kuwa ni mfalme wao. Pilato alikataa kubadilisha na kuwaambia kile alichokiandika kitabakia pale. Hii yawezekana ilikuwa ni kwasababu ya imani dogo iliyokuwa kwa Yesu  Pilate wrote a sign to be hung on the cross so that people would know who He was and what “crime” he had done. This inscription read, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews” and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin so that it could be read by everyone present. The Jews were bothered by this sign and they went to Pilate and insisted that it should read something to the effect of, “Jesus of Nazareth, who called himself King of the Jews” since they did not believe that He was their king. Pilate refused to make the change and told them that what he wrote would remain there. This was probably because of the slight belief that he had in Jesus.</p>
<p>Baada ya askari kumvulia Yesu nguo na kumwangika juu ya msalaba, walichukua mavazi kama nyara. Waligawanya kanzu yake katika vipande nne kila askari alichukua aliyosaidia kumwangika msalabani. Ndipo walienda kuligawa vazi lake la nje, lakini hawakuligawanya kirahisi, walilitupa ili waone nani atakaye lichukua lote. Haya yalifanywa katika kukamilisha unabii uliotolewa katika Zaburi 22:18.  After the soldiers stripped Jesus and hung Him on the cross, they took his clothes as a spoil. They parted His robe into four pieces at the seams--one for each soldier that helped hang Him on the cross. They then were going to divide His outer coat, but since it had no seams to easily divide it, they chose to cast lots to see who would take the whole thing. This was done in fulfillment of the prophecy given in Psalm 22:18.</p>
<h3>Waombolezaji waliokuwa chini ya msalaba 18:25-27 The mourners at the foot of the cross 18:25-27</h3>
<p>Pembeni mwa msalaba, walikusanyika kundi kuomboleza kifo cha yesu. Kundi hili At the foot of the cross, there gathered a group to mourn to death of Jesus. This group</p>
<p>Alikuwepo Yohana mwanafunzi na wanawake kadhaa, akiwemo mama wa Yesu.  consisted of John the disciple and several women, including the mother of Jesus.</p>

Zechariah 12:10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, The spirit of grace and of supplications: And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, And they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, And shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.</blockquote>
<h3>Mwili ulihifadhiwa na rafiki zake 18:38-42 Body taken care of by friends 18:38-42</h3>
<p>Ulitolewa nje! Yusufu wa Arimathaya alikuwa mwema na mtu wa heshima na alikuwa mwanachama wa baraza la Kiyahudi, lakini hakukubali maamuzi yaliyofanywa juu ya Yesu {Luk. 23:50,51}. Yeye alimwamini Yesu na hakukubaliana na Wayahudi, hakuungama wazi imani hii ya Mwana wa Mungu kwasababu aliogopa kupoteza umaarufu wake na kuteswa na Wayahudi, Yusufu alijaribu kuwa mwanafunzi kwa siri, lakini ulifika muda walipotambua na kujitangaza wazi kuwa alikuwa mfuasi wa Kristo. alienda kwa mtawala kwa ujasiri na kuomba mwili wa Yesu. Kama unaenda kumtumikia Kristo, tuende tukayafanye wazi na kwa ujasiri mkuu haijalishi watu wengine wanatufanyia nini au wanatufikiriaje. ukimwonea aibu, naye atatuonea aibu {Mark. 8:38}.    The secret’s out! Joseph of Arimathaea was a good and honorable man and a member of the Jewish council, but he did not agree with the decisions that they made concerning Jesus (Luke 23:50, 51). Though he believed in Jesus and disagreed with the Jews, he did not openly confess this faith in the Son of God because he feared losing his reputation and being persecuted by the Jews. Joseph had tried to be a secret disciple, but now came a time when he realized that he had to make an open declaration of allegiance to Christ. He did it in the most conspicuous way as he went to the governor and asked for the body of Jesus. If we are going to serve Christ, we are going to have to do it openly and with full confidence no matter what others may do to us or think about us. If we are ashamed of Him, then He will be ashamed of us (Mark 8:38).</p>
<p>Nikodemo { yuleyule kama katika sura ya tatu na saba} kitu kingine kama ilivyo hapo juu kwenye pointi hii hawakujitangaza kumtumikia Yesu, na bado tunamwona yeye pia akiungana na Yusufu katika maandalizi ya kuuzika mwili. Alileta manukato yaliokuwa yanahitajika kuuandaa mwili, na Yusufu, aliulaza mwili kaburini. Kaburi lilikuwa pango lilochongwa mwambani ambalo lilikuwepo jiwe kubwa la duara lilovingirishwa mbele ya uwazi kuzuia watu kuuharibu mwili. Hili lilikuwa kaburi lake Yusufu aliyejiandalia mwenyewe siku yake atakapokufa, lakini  amelitoa kwa mtu yule aliyemwamini. { Mt. 27:60}.  Nicodemus (the same as in chapters three and seven) is another one that up to this point had not made an outright declaration to serve Jesus, and yet now we see him join in with Joseph in the preparation of the body for burial. He brought the spices needed to prepare the body and, with Joseph, he laid the body in the tomb. The tomb was a cave hewn out of a wall of rock that had a large round stone that would be rolled in front of the opening to prevent people from tampering with the body. This was Joseph’s own tomb that he had recently prepared for the day that he himself would die, but now he gave it to the One whom he believed (Matt. 27:60). </p>
