<h1>Chapter 15: He is the True Vine</h1>
<p>Yesu alianza sura hii kwa kujieleza mwenyewe kama fumbo la kuwa Mzabibu wa kweli na mwanadamu kama matawi. Sura hii inakumbusha kutoa maisha yetu ya asili kwa Yesu, mtu akikaa ndani ya Kristo, ndipo atakuwa na nguvu za uzima na ule uzima utaonekana na udhihirisho wa maisha yale utawaleta watu wengine kwa Kristo. Sio watu wote wakaao katika Kristo ni wa kweli hata kama wanakiri kile wanacho kifanya; hawa watu hawana faida na hawana sehemu kwa Kristo katika siku ya hukumu. Jesus begins this chapter with an allegory depicting Himself as the true vine and humanity as the branches. This chapter reaffirms to us the life giving nature of Christ; if a man is dwelling in Christ, then he will be full of life and that life will show and outward manifestation of that life that will bring other men to Christ. Not all men will truly abide in Christ even though they proclaim that they do; these men are unprofitable and will have no place with Christ on the Judgment Day.</p>
<h2>Mzabibu {Kristo} 15:1-6 The Vine (Christ) 15:1-6</h2>
<p>Yesu alitangaza katika kufungua fumbo hili kwa kuanza kusema Yeye ni ni mzabibu wa kweli na Baba yake ndiye Mkulima. Baba ni yule aliyebuni mpango wa wokovu... ni yule aliyepanda mzabibu hapa katika dunia hii hivyo kulikuwa na chaguzi kwa watu watakao kuambatana naye. Kazi ya Mungu hufanywa na watu wote waliotayari na kuunganishwa kwa uwezo wa Kiungu na katika moyo mmoja na akili moja. Kristo hakubuni hii kazi mwenyewe , bali aliifanya kwa utii mkamilifu wa mapenzi ya Mkulima {Yoh. 5:36,  17:34}.    Jesus declares in the opening of this allegory by stating that He is the true vine and that the Father is the Husbandman. The Father is the One that created the plan of salvation-¬the One that planted the Vine here in this earth so there would be an option for men to be attached to Him. The work of God made provision for all men to be united with the Godhead in one heart and one mind. Christ did not create this work Himself, but He acted in complete obedience to the will of the Husbandman (John 5:36; 17:4).</p>
<p>Ndipo Yesu alieleza kwa wanafunzi wake aina mbili ya matawi ambayo yanahusika katika aina za watu: Matawi yasiyozaa, ambaye ni wenye dhambi, na matawi yazaayo, ambaye ni watakatifu. Matawi yasiyozaa hukatwa na kuondolewa kwenye mzabibu, na matawi yazaavyo huyasafisha ili yaweze kuzaa matunda zaidi. Mungu atasafisha maisha yako kwa vitu ambavyo vinakutatiza katika kuzalisha matokeo. Dhambi katika maisha yetu huficha uwezo wa kushuhudia vile tulivyovipoteza, vivyo tunatakiwa kumruhusu Mungu ajithibitishe kwetu ndipo majibu ya yale yatatokea kwa kutubu. Kama tutaendelea kugeukia katika mikono ya Muumba, tutaendelea kukua imara zaidi na mwanga wetu utang'aa zaidi.   Jesus then explains to His disciples two types of branches that correspond to two types of people: the unproductive branches, which are sinners, and the productive branches, which are saints. The unproductive branches are altogether cut off from the vine, while the productive branches are pruned so that they will bring forth more fruit. God will purify your life of things that are hindering you from producing results. Sin in our lives will hinder our ability to witness to the lost, so we must allow God to convict us and then respond to that conviction by repenting. If we continue to be pliable in the hands of the Creator, we will continue to grow stronger and our light will grow brighter.</p>
<p Haya matawi yazaayo hayawezi kuzaa matunda nje ya uwezo wao wenyewe, bali yatazaa matunda kwasababu yameunganishwa na mzabibu. Matawi ambayo hayajaunganishwa kutoka kwenye mmea wa asili hautatoa matunda kwa matokeo yeyote, ukweli ni huohuo kiroho pia, hatutaweza, kuweza, usitazamie matunda ya kweli katika maisha haya, labda uwe umejiunganisha na Kristo. Lazima wakati wote tutunze mioyo yetu na nia katika kujipeleleza ili tusije tukakulia ujasiri wa uwezo wetu bali tuhakikishe kwamba tunamtegemea Mungu kwa kila jambo tunalolifanya.   These productive branches did not produce the fruit out of any ability of their own, but they produced fruit because they were connected to the vine. A branch that is disconnected from a natural plant will never bring forth any results, the same is true in the spiritual, for we can never, ever, expect to be truly productive in this life unless we are united with Christ. We must constantly keep our hearts and motives in check so that we never grow confident in our abilities and to ensure that we are depending on God in every thing that we do.</p>
<p>Kama tutabaki kwake, ndipo tutegemee kuzaa matunda. Watu wataona kazi nzuri na kumtukuza Mungu {Mat. 5:16}. Kama maisha yetu yanamtukuza Yesu kiukweli, watu watamwinua wokovu katika Kristo {Yoh. 12:32}. Nafsi zetu zitaokolewa kwa ushuhuda wetu kiliko kupata zawadi za mwilini. Pesa na vitu vingine wa kimwili vitapata kutu na kuisha, bali nafsi ya watu ambao wanaongozwa kwa Kristo wataishi milele na watakumbuka uzima wa mielel kwa imani zao. If we do remain in Him, then we can expect to bring forth fruit. Men will see our good works and glorify God (Matthew 5:16). If our lives are truly exalting Jesus, then men will be drawn unto salvation in Christ (John 12:32). Souls getting saved by our witness is better than any physical reward that we could gain. Money and other physical goods will soon rot and rust, but the souls of the men that we lead to Christ will live forever and will be an eternal memorial to our faithfulness.</p>
<p Yale matawi yasizaa yatakatwa kwenye mzabibu na na kukusanywa tayari kwa kuchomwa moto ili kuharibiwa. Watu hawawezi kukaa mbali na Kristo kwa muda mrefu mpaka wakose uelekeo wa maisha ya kweli. Watanyauka, ambaye ni, furaha na amani ambayo itajitenga kwenye maisha yao na watajulikana wako hatarini. Watu wengi watajaribu kujipata furaha, lakini watajikuta wamezama kwenye huzuni. Hatimaye watatupwa kwenye ziwa la moto la milele {ufu. 20:15}.    Those unproductive branches that have been cut off of the vine are soon withered are eventually cast into the fire to be destroyed. Men cannot live apart from Christ for too long until it will be quite noticeable that they have no real life. They will wither up, that is, the joy and peace will depart from their life and they will be known to be miserable. Many people may try to put on a facade of happiness, but deep down inside they know that there are unhappy. The eventual end of these sous are that they are to be cast forever into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:15).</p>
<h2>Matawi yanayozaa {Watakatifu} 15:7-17 The Productive Branches (The Saints) 15:7-17</h2>
<p>Sasa Yesu anaweka wazi azo lake la mzabibu wa kweli na matawi yanayozaa na yasiyozaa, aliendelea zaidi kwa kuwafafanulia watu wanaowakilisha pande zote mbili za matawi,akianza na lile lenye matunda. Now that Jesus briefly covered the ideas of the True Vine and the productive and unproductive branches, He then goes on by explaining the people represented by both types of branches, beginning with the fruitful boughs.</p>
<p>Kama tulivyokwisha kuyataja hapo mwanzoni, tawi lizaalo ni lile tuu lilounganishwa kwa Yesu. Tunatakiwa kumtegemee yeye kikamilifu kama anathamani yeyote katika maisha yetu. Kwa maana ndani yake yeye tunaishi, tunakwenda na kuwa na uhai wetu {Mdo. 17:28}. Vilevile kama mtoto amtegemeaye mama kwa kila kitu anayekihitaji, hata sisi tumtegemee Mungu, tuache kufanya mapenzi haya yenye matokeo fulani haya yale ya hatari. Kumb.30:20 na Yoh.14:6 inatueleza kuwa Mungu hatusaidii katika maisha yetu tuu, bali kwa kuwa Yeye ni maisha yetu.  As already mentioned earlier, the productive branches are only so because they are connected to Christ. We must fully depend upon Him if there is to be any value in our lives. We are hopeless without Him for in Him we live and move and have our being (Acts 17:28). Even as a child must depend upon its mother for everything it needs, even so must we depend upon God; to neglect to do this will certainly result in absolute disaster. Deuteronomy 30:20 and John 14:6 explain that God will not only help us in life, but that He is our life.</p>

<h3>Lazima tukae katika Neno lake 15:7, 8 We must abide in His Words 15:7, 8</h3>
<p>Sehemu ya kukaa katika Kristo ni Neno lake kukaa kwetu. Watu wengi walikiri kumfuata Yesu, na bado ni vigumu kulijua Neno lake, acha mimi nilitii. Yesu alisema kama tutakuwa ndani yake, na Neno lake litakuwa ndani ya sehemu ya maisha yetu. Tumeamuriwa tujifunze Neno {II Tim 2:15}. Litafakari {Yosh.1:8}, na likumbuke {Mith. 2:1, 5; Zab. 119:11}. Tunafanya haya si kama watu waliokufa bali uzima kwetu {Yoh. 6:63, 68}. Haitoshi kwetu kuwa na ufahamu wa maneno haya au hata kwa kuyaongea, bali kuyatii.  A part of abiding in Christ is for His words to abide in us. Many people proclaim to follow Jesus, and yet they hardly know any of His words, let alone obey them. Jesus was saying that if we are to be united with Him, the His Word had to be an integrated part of our lives. We are commanded to study the Word (II Tim. 2:15), mediate upon it (Josh. 1:8), and remember it (Proverbs 2:1, 5; Psalm 119:11). We are to do this so that it will be more than dead letters but life unto us (John 6:63, 68). It is not enough for us to just have an understanding of these words or even to speak them, but we must obey them.</p>
<h3>Lazima tukae katik pendo lake 15:9-17 We must abide in His love 15:9-17</h3>
<p>Ingawa ni muhimu kuzaa matunda ya kiroho, utii kwa sheria ya Mungu hautoshi wenyewe; utii lazima uwe pamoja na upendo. Utii wa kweli na upendo wa kweli ni mavazi mawili yasiyoonekana ambayo hayawezi kutenganishwa kila moja. Kama unampenda Mungu ndipo utatunza amri zake {Yoh. 14:15} Rum 13:8-10 inaeleza kuwa upendo ni utimilifu wa sheria kwasababu kama unaupendo juu ya mtu fulani, ndipo hautataka kumumiiza kwa njia yeyote; Yesu alisema kwa vitendo kitu kilekile, alisemea upendo kuwa "shika sheria yote na manabii" {Mat.22:37-40}.  Although it is essential to bearing spiritual fruit, obedience to the laws of God is not enough in itself; obedience must be coupled with love. True obedience and true love are a garment with no seem--the two cannot be absolutely distinguished from each other. If you love God, then you will keep His commandments (John 14:15). Romans 13:8-10 explains that love is the fulfilling of the law because if you have love towards someone, then you will not want to hurt them in any way; Jesus said practically the same thing when He said that on love “hang[s] all the law and the prophets” (Matthew 22:37-40).</p>
<p>Pasipo upendo wa Mungu, kazi zetu zote nzuri hazina faida {IKor 13:1-3}. waweza kufuata sheria zote za Mungu kwa barua, bado kama moyo wako na nia yako haiko sahihi hautaweza kuzaa tunda lolote. Without the love of God, all of our good works are in vain (I Cor. 13:1-3). You may obey all the commands of God to the letter, yet if your heart and motives are not right then you will never bring forth any fruit.</p>
<h2>Matawi yasiyozaa {wenye dhambi} 15:18-27 The Unproductive Branches (The Sinners) 15:18-27</h2>
<p>Hatuokolewi kwa kazi nzuri {Efe. 2:8, 9}, bali tunaokolewa mara moja tu, tunalazimika kufanya wokovu wetu kwa kazi nzuri. Mtu asyejali kutoa watu wengine katika shimo kwamba nataingia nayeye, tutamkuta ghafla nyuma katika shimo. Wale ambayo wanakuja kuwa sehemu ya mzabibu wa Kristo watajikuta ghafla na wenyewe wamejitenga ingawa waliweza kuzaa matunda.   We are not saved by good works (Eph. 2:8, 9), but once we are saved, we must maintain our salvation by good works. A man that cares not to pull others out of the same pit that he was once in, will soon find himself back in the pit. Those that have become a part of the vine of Christ will soon find themselves severed unless they bring forth fruit.</p>
<p>Kuna watu wengi wanakiri kuwa sehemu ya mwili wa Kristo, lakini bado hawana umoja naye kwasababu ya dhambi zao na uchoyo unaowafanya walele. Wengine hawajawhi kupandikizwa ukweli katika Kristo na bado wanazungumza kama ni kweli. Hizi aina mbili za watu wanajifanya kana kwamba wanamjua Mungu wanaenda kanisani na hata kuhuburi, lakini wanadanganya watu na wenyewe wanaamini kuwa huu ndio ukweli, Mungu hadanganywi. Katika siku ya hukumu ngano na magugu zitajitenga na waongo watatupwa hukumu ya milele. Matawi yote yaliyojitenga Hayatakuwa na udhuru katika sehemu ya Kristo bali watakuwa katika unafki. There are many men that proclaim to be a part of the body of Christ, yet they have long been disunited from Him because of their sin and selfishness that they let slip in. Others have never truly been engrafted into Christ and yet they speak as if they have. Both of these types of men will act as if they know God and will go to church and even preach, but though they may have deceived men and even themselves to believe that this is true, God is not deceived. In the Judgment Day He will separate the wheat from the chaff and will cast the false into eternal judgment. Other unconnected branches have never pledged to be a part of Christ and they will meet the same ending as the hypocrite.</p>
<h3>Watatuchukia kama walivyomchukia Yesu 15:18-20 They will hate us as they hated Jesus 15:18-20</h3>
<p>Yesu alionya kwamba haya matawi ambayo hayana faida yatatuchukia... sababu yake ya kusema hivyo? kama wanamchukia Yeye, hakika watamchukia kila mtu akimfuata Yeye kweli. Luka 6:26 Yesu aliwatangazia kuwa haitakuwa kitu jambo zuri kama watu wote wangezungumza vema kwa maana hiyo pasingekuwa na kitu chochote kingethibitisha dhambi zao na kugeukia kwa Mungu. Jesus warned that these unprofitable branches will hate us--His reason for saying so? Because if they hated Him, then they will surely hate anyone that is truly following Him. In Luke 6:26 Jesus proclaimed that it would not be a good thing if all men spoke well of you for that means that there is nothing in you that is convicting them of their sin and compelling them to turn to God.</p>
<h3>Walimchukia Yesu  watamchukia na Baba 15:21-27 They hate Jesus even as they hated the Father 15:21-27</h3>
<p>Hawakufikiri kuwa wanamchukia Baba, bali walifikiri vinywa vyao havikusema chochote kwa Mungu, mioyo yao ilikuwa mbali na Naye {Isay 29:13}. Kama wangemjua Baba kweli, pia wangemkubali na Yesu alipokuja.  They did not think that they hated the Father, but though their mouths drew nigh to God, their hearts were far from Him (Isaiah 29:13). If they had truly known the Father, then they would have accepted Jesus when He came.</p>
