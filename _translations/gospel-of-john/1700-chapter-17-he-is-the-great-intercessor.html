<h1Sura ya kumi na saba. Yeye ni muombezi mkuu  Chapter 17: He is The Great Intercessor</h1>
<p Sura hii hasahasa inarejea kama ile ya "maombi ya Kuhani mkuu" ya Kristo kwasababu katika yake, Kristo alisimama kati ya Mungu na mwanadamu kama vile Ukuhani wa Walawi katika Agano la kale walivyofanya. Mawazo makuu ya maombi haya, ambaye ni marefu sana ya Yesu yaliyoandikwa ni umoja; Kristo alisimama kwa wanadamu na alifanya daraja ili kwamba mwanadamu awe pamoja na Mungu.  This chapter is commonly referred to as “The High Priestly Prayer” of Christ because in it, Christ intercedes between God and man even as the Levitical priests in the Old Testament did. The main thought of this prayer, which is the longest recorded prayer of Jesus, is unity; Christ has interceded for mankind and has formed a bridge so that man can be one with God.</p>
<p>R. J. D. Utley alisema Wapenzi Wanafunzi kumbukeni na Nyaraka:  Injili ya Yohana, I, II, na III, "Hii sura ni ngumu kuigawanya katika masomo kwasababu visa vinavyofanana vinatajwa kwa kujirudia tena na tena. Ni kama sinema yenye muundo wa kujirudiarudia. Maneno ya ufunguo ni "utukufu", 'toa', 'kujua,' 'tuma,' 'jina,' 'ulimwengu,' na 'umoja,'. R. J. D. Utley said in The Beloved Disciple's Memoirs and Letters: The Gospel of John, I, II, and III John, “This chapter is difficult to divide into subjects because the same motifs are mentioned over and over again. This is like a tapestry of recurrent patterns. The key words are ‘glory,’ ‘give,’ ‘know,’ ‘sent,’ ‘name,’ ‘the world,’ and ‘one.’”</p>
<h2>Yesu alijiombea mwenyewe 17:1-5 Jesus Prayed for Himself 17:1-5</h2>
<p>Sehemu ya mwanzo ya maombi haya ni kwa Kristo Mwenyewe. Ni shauku yake katika saa hii ya mwisho ya dhiki hii kubwa kwa kuwa hatafuata mapenzi yake mwenyewe bali mapenzi ya Baba yafanyike na kwa kuwa Yeye atatukuzwa. The beginning section of this prayer is for Christ Himself. It is His desire that in this last hour of great tribulation that He would not follow His own will but that the will of the Father be done and that He would be glorified.</p>
<h3>Yesu aliyainua macho yake juu mbinguni 17:1a Jesus lifted His eyes towards heaven 17:1a</h3>
<p>Yesu hakupungua Uungu wowote kuliko Baba alivyo, bali alikuwa nayo na wakati wote alikuwa mtiifu kwake. Tumeona hapa ameinua macho yake mbinguni na kuomba Baba afanye kazi katika saa hii ngumu ya ukumbusho.  Jesus was not any less God than the Father was, but He aways has and always will operate in submission to Him. We see Him here lifting up His eyes towards heaven and He petitions the Father to work in this monumental hour.</p>
<h3>Saa imefika 17:1b The hour is come 17:1b</h3>
<p>Yesu mara zote alitenda kazi kulingana na jedwali la wakati wa Mungu. Tumeona mistari kadhaa katika kitabu cha Yohana wakati wa kusulubiwa haikuwa kwa bahati mbaya bali ulikuwa ni mpango wa Mungu na Kristo alijua {Yoh.2:4; 4:21; 7:30; 8:20; 13:1.   Jesus always operated according to the timeframe of God. We see from several verses in the book of John that the timing of the crucifixion was not haphazard but it was planned by God and known by Christ (John 2:4; 4:21; 7:30; 8:20; 13:1).</p>
<h3>Huu ni uzima wa milele 17:2,3 This is life eternal 17:2, 3</h3>
<p>Fahamu Yesu hakuwa sehemu ya uzima, bali ni uzima {Yoh. 14:6; Flp. 1;21; IYoh. 5:12}. Kwahiyo hatulegei; bali ijapokuwa utu wetu wa nje unachakaa, lakini utu wetu wa ndani unafanywa upya siku kwa siku {II Kor. 4:16}. Knowing Jesus is not merely a part of life, but it is life (John 14:6; Phil. 1:21; I John 5:12). So often we allow God to move from the focus of our hearts and He is crowded out by religion and formality, but we need to keep the flame of His life burning in us everyday (II Cor. 4:16).</p>
<h3>Utukufu 17:4, 5 The glory 17:4, 5</h3>
<p>Hili neno "utukufu" ni moja ya neno linaloeleweka kwetu kama wasomaji wa kitabu cha Yohana. Lilitumiwa katika utangulizi wakati tunanasema kwamba, "Tutazame utukufu wake, utukufu kama wa mwana pekee wa Baba" { Yoh. 1:14}. Neno utukufu limetumika mara 12 katika kitabu cha Yohana na ufafanuzi wa kutukuza umetumika mara 21.  This term “the glory” is one that has been very familiar to us as we have studied the book of John. It was used in the prologue when it says that, “We beheld His glory, the glory as the only begotten of the Father” (John 1:14). The word glory is used 12 times in John and variations of glorify are used 21 times.</p>
<p>Kwetu, kutukuza maana yake kufanya kuu, lakini kwa Yesu inamaana kujifunua kwa wanadamu ukuu wake. Kwa ujumla inazungumzia kwetu udhihirisho wa Uungu na nguvu ya Kristo na sana sana inazungumzia kwetu ya kusulubiwa. Kristo mara zote aliangalia msalaba akiwa na maana ya kumtukuza Mungu {Yoh. 12:23}. Paulo pia aliona utukufu kwenye msalaba {Gal. 6:14}.  To us, to glorify generally means to make great, but to Jesus it meant to reveal to humanity His greatness. Generally it speaks to us the manifestation of the divinity and power of Christ and it specifically speaks to us of the crucifixion. Christ always looked upon the cross as a means of glorifying God (John 12:23). Paul also saw glory in the cross (Gal. 6:14).</p>
<h2>Yesu aliombea Wanafunzi wake waliokuwepo 17;6-19 Jesus Prayed for His Current Disciples 17:6-19</h2>
<p>Japo alianza maombi yake kwa akijihusisha mwenyewe, hakuchua muda mrefu kubaki pale. tumeona kuwa maombi yake mengi ni kwa wengine. Tunaweza kujifunza kwa mfano wake badala ya kutafuta msaada kwa mahitaji yetu wenyewe tunatakiwa kutumia muda mwingi wa maombi yetu tuombe kwa ajili ya mahitaji ya wengine. Tunampata Ayubu tuu katika dhiki yake akiwaombea marafiki zake { Ayub. 42:10}.   While He began His prayer focused on Himself, He did not long remain there. We see that the majority of His prayer is for others. We can learn from His example and instead of always seeking for help for our own needs we should spend much of our prayer time interceding for the needs of others. Job found relief to his tribulation only when he prayed for his friends (Job 42:10).</p>
<p>Hatuna nakala hii tu ya Yesu akiwaombea Wanafunzi wake, kwani tumeona akimwambia Petro katika Luka 22:32 kwamba atamwombea. Haikujalisha hata kama alikuwa kimwili duniani, bado alikuwa akifanya maombi kwa wafuasi wake { Rum. 8:34; Ebr. 7:25}.  This is not the only record we have of Jesus interceding for His disciples, for we see Him tell Peter in Luke 22:32 that He prayed for him. Even though He is no longer physically on this earth, He is still making intercession for His followers (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25).</p>
<h3> Maombi kwa kujilinda 17;6-12 A prayer for protection 17:6-12</h3>
<p>Yesu alitambua kuwa Wanafunzi watapokea na kulihifadhi neno alilowapa. Alikuwa na ujasiri kwamba sasa wameelewa yale maneno aliyowaambia zaidi kuliko walivyofikiri au falsafa nzuri, bali walitambua kuwa ni maneno ya Mungu. Yesu alitaka wabaki katika sehemu hii ya kuamini na kumtegemea Mungu na atamwomba Mungu awalinde baada ya kuwaacha kimwili duniani. Jesus recognized that the disciples had received and cherished the words that He had given them. He was confident that they now understood that the words He spoke were more than positive thinking or good philosophy, but they realized they were the words of God. Jesus wanted them to remain in this place of believing and trusting in God and He prayed that God would keep them after He physically left the world.</p>
<h3>Maombi ya kuwatuliza 17;13-15 A prayer for satisfaction 17:13-15</h3>
<h4> Wawe na furaha 17:13 That they have joy 17:13</h4>
<h4>Wawe na Neno 17:14 That they have the Word 17:14</h4>
<h4>Wawe na amani 17:15 That they might have peace 17:15</h4>
<p>Yesu hakuomba kuwa watolewe katika ulimwengu wa mwovu, bali awalinde  Jesus did not pray that they would be taken out of this evil world, but that they would</p>
<p>Wawe na amani na walindwe watakapokuwa katika ulimwengu.  have peace and be kept while they were in this world.</p>
<h3>Maombi ya utakaso 17:16-19  A prayer for sanctification 17:16-19</h3>
<p>Yesu alikuwa na shauku kuwa ataondoka ulimwenguni na kutengwa na Mungu huduma yake. Njia pekee kwa wanafunzi wake kutakaswa na ile kweli, au kutengwa, ni kwa kupitia kweli ya Neno la Mungu. Inatuonyesha maagizo ya sheria, ambaye yanatuambia tujitenge kutoka dhambini, na inatuambia kuhusu ahadi ya neema na jinsi gani tutaunganishwa na Yeye. Jesus had a desire that they would come out of the world and be separated unto God and His service. The only way for the disciple to truly be sanctified, or set apart, is through the truth of the Word of God. It shows us the commandments of the Law, which tell us to separate from sin, and it tells us of the promises of grace and how we can be united with Him.</p>
<h2>Yesu aliwaombea Wanafunzi wa baadaye 17:20-26  Jesus Prayed for His Future Disciples 17:20-26</h2>
<p>Yesu alijua kutakuwa na watu zaidi ambao watakuwa wafuasi badala ya wale kumi na mbili. Kutakuwa na Wayahudi wengi watakao mwona Yeye ni Mesia wa kweli. Zaidi, kitambo wengi watatambua kuwa wokovu kwa Mataifa na siyo kwa Wayahudi tuu wengi watkuwa viungo wa mwili wa Kristo. Ni ajabu kufikiri kwamba  Yesu aliomba yale maombi akiangalia mbele na alituombea na sisi tunayeishi leo. Jesus knew that there would be more people that would become His followers besides the twelve disciples. There would be many other Jews that would see Him as the true Messiah. Moreover, soon many would realize that salvation was to the Gentile and not only the Jew and many would join the body of Christ. It is wonderful to think that while Jesus prayed that prayer that He looked ahead in time and prayed for us that live today!</p>
<h3>Aliwaombea waweze kuwa na umoja 17:20, 21. He prayed that they might be united 17:20, 21</h3>
<p>Daima alikuwa na mpango na shauku ya Mungu awe na ushirika na mwanadamu. Alimuumba Adamu ili aweze kutembea naye siku za upweke na bado Yeye anashiriki ule umoja pamoja nasi It has always been the plan and desire of God to have fellowship with man. He created Adam so that He could walk with him in the cool of the day and He still desires to share that union with us.</p>
<h3>Alituombea namna tuwezavyo kuunganishwa 17:22-26 He prayed how they would be united 17:22-26</h3>
<p>Kuungana na Mumgu ni zaidi kuliko kukiri utii kweke, bali kila tabia za maisha yetu lazima tushinde pamoja naye. Kama alivyofunga haya maombi, Yesu aliomba maisha yetu yote yamtafute Yeye. Lazima tukumbuke kwamba jinsi tuendavyo katika maisha yetu si kwa nguvu zetu wenyewe na uwezo wetu utupayo ushindi, bali maombi ya mwombezi na Kristo kujitoa sadaka ya kifo itutunzavyo kiroho. Being united with God is so much more than just proclaiming allegiance to Him, but every aspect of our lives must be intertwined with Him. As He closed His prayer, Jesus asked that our whole lives would be found in Him. We must remember that as we go through life that it is not our own ability and might that brings us victory, but it is the intercessory prayer and sacrificial death of Christ that keeps us spiritually well.</p>
<p>Yesu hakuwaombea wale tu walioungana naye na Baba, bali wale watakayoungana na wengine. Watu wengi waliokiri kuwa wakristo wasijitenge na wakristo wengine. Kama tunaenda kuwa kweli wamoja na Mungu, ni lazima tuwe wamoja kila mmoja wetu  Jesus not only prayed that we would be united with Him and the Father, but that we would be united with each other. Many people that proclaim to be Christians cannot get along with other Christians. If we are going to be truly united with God, we must also be united with each other.</p>
<h4>Katika utukufu 17:22, 23 In glory 17:22, 23</h4>
<p>Chanzo cha umoja ni utukufu wa Mungu, utukufu mkuu ambaye Yesu mwenyewe ameumiliki. The source of unity is God's glory, the very glory which Jesus Himself possessed.</p>
<p>Ni utukufu wa Mungu waliopewa waumini wale walioungana na kufanya umoja wa Kristo.  It is the glory of God given to believers that unites believers and makes them one with Jesus</p>
<p>na Baba yake atakuwa na umoja na kila mmoja. Wakati huo waumini watafahamu utukufu wake and His Father and one with each other. When believers experience the glory of God they</p>
<p>Wawe na sifa moja, na kusudi  become one in character, and purpose.</p>
<h4>Katika nafasi 17:24 In position 17:24</h4>
<p>Yesu alitamani kuwa tuwe nayeye alipo tuwepo. Kuwa wamoja na Yesu ni lazima tumfuate kweli katika hatua zake na tuende aendako. Kama tutafuata uelewa wetu wenyewe tutajikuta wenyewe tuko mbali naye na kujitenga na Mungu. Si lazima tumfuate katika mifano yake aliyoifanya vizuri, bali tuwe pia tayari kuteswa kama alivyoteswa Yeye. Jesus desired that we would be with Him where He was. To be united with Jesus we must truly follow in His steps and go where He goes. If we follow our own understanding we will find ourselves far from Him and disunited from God. We must not only follow in His example of well doing, but we must also be ready to suffer even as He suffered (Matthew 10:38).</p>
<h4>Katika ufahamu 17:25  In knowledge 17:25</h4>
<h4> Katika upendo 17:26 In love 17:26</h4>
<p>Maisha yetu si yetu wenyewe; ni maisha yake ndani yetu. Maisha yake na upendo wake aliyatoa kwetu kutusaidia Our lives are not our own; It is His life in us. His life and love are given to us to help</p>
<p>Tupendane love one another. </p>
