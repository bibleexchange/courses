The Problem 5:1-5</h3>
<p>Yohana sura ya tano inafungua kurudi kwa Yesu Yerusalemu na kuhudhuria kwenye sikukuu ya wayahudi.Inafikiriwa na wengi kwamba hii ilikuwa Pasaka,lakini hakuna ushahidi aidha kwa kuthibitisha au kutothibitisha nadharia hii.Ilikuwa ni safari hii kwenda mji mtakatifu ambao Yesu alitembelea katika kisima cha kuogolea kiitwacho betsaida,ambalo lilikuwa karibu na lango la kondoo(imetafasiriwa kama soko la kondoo katika KJV,bali inakaribia kwa hakika kurejea katika lango lililojengwa na Eliashib na familia yake wakati Yerusalemu ilipojengwa mara ya pili kama ilivyosemwa katika Nehemia3:1). Bwawa hili lilikuwa na simlizi nyuma yake ambayo kwa wakati sahihi katika mwaka malaika hushuka toka mbinguni na kuyatibua maji;mara moja maji yakiguswa mtu wa kwanza aingiaye majini aliponywa ugonjwa wote aliokuwa nao.Tukio hili halikuwa rahisi kama hadithi ya mazingaumbwe au utapeli bali ni mwandishi aliyevuviwa kimungu wa andiko lililoandika ukweli,na inawezakana kwamba yeye alikuwa anamjuwa mtu fulani kibinafisi ambaye alikuwa ameponywa kwa miaka iliopita kwa kuingia tu mara ya kwanza katika hilo bwawa.Jina betisaida humaanisha nyumba ya huruma na lifanana na jina lake kwa sababu ya huduma ya kimiujiza ya mahali hapo kwa huruma ya Mungu.</p>John chapter five opens up with Jesus returning to Jerusalem to attend &ldquo;a feast of the Jews.&rdquo; It is thought by many that this &ldquo;feast&rdquo; was the Passover, but there is no evidence to either concretely prove or disprove that theory. It was during this trip to the Holy City that Jesus visited the pool named Bethesda, which is by the sheep gate (it is translated sheep market in the KJV, but it almost certainly referring to the gate built by Eliashib and his family when Jerusalem was rebuilt as told in Nehemiah 3:1). This pool had a legend behind it that at a certain time in the year an angel would come down from heaven and stir the water; once the water was troubled the first person that got into the water was healed of any diseases they possessed. This occurrence was not simply a fairy tale or hoax, but the divinely inspired writer of the Scripture wrote it as a fact, and it is possible that he had known someone personally that had been healed in years past by making it first into the pool. The name Bethesda means &ldquo;house [or place] of mercy&rdquo; and is likely named so because of all the miraculous cures wrought there by the mercy of God.</p>
<p>Chini ya matao matano yaliyozunguza bwawa hili yalikusanya kundi la watu walioathiriwa na magonjoa yenye kufikirika.Watu hawa wote walitaka kuponywa kwa wakati wakutibuliwa kwa maji kwa hakika wote kwa uchoyo kila moja alisukumiza na kupigana na kujaribu na kumata thamani iliotamaniwa ya ufufuo.Ilikuwa katikati ya kusanyika la wanaichi hawa muhimu ambalo walimlaza mwenyeji wa hapo ambaye alikwisha kuwa mgonjwa kwa miaka thelthini na minane.Hatujui ni ugonjwa gani alikuwa nao au hatujui nikwa mda gani ugonjwa ulimtupa kitandani,lakini tunajuwa kuwa Yesu alipokuja katika bwawa ambalo yeye hakuweza kujipeleka bila msaada wa mtu mwingine.</p>
Underneath the five porches that surrounded this pool there gathered a multitude of people vexed with every disease imaginable. These people all wanted to be healed and at the time of troubling of the water they certainly all selfishly pushed and fought to try to capture the coveted prize of rejuvenation. It was in the midst of this crowd of impotent folk that there lay a certain man that had been sick for thirty-eight years. We do not know what disease he had or for how long the disease had rendered him bedridden, but we do know that when Jesus came to the pool that he was unable to move about without the help of another man.</p>
<h3>AhadiThe Promise 5:6-9</h3>
<p>Pamoja na kiasi kikubwa cha watu kusubiri kuponywa,ningumu kwa akili kufikiri kwamba kwanini Yesu alichagua mtu huyu moja kumponya badala ya kuponya mkutano wote.Yawezekana kabisa Yesu alijua kwamba wengine hawangeweza kuitikia amri rahisi ya imani na kwamba walikuwa wamefunikwa na mshangao wa muujiza huu wa mwaka wa ndovu kumla mwanawe kufaa pamoja na kitu kingine zaidi.Watu wengi bado wako kwenye njia hii;wanatazamia mikutano maalumu na miguso wakati kuna mwendo mkubwa wa Roho mtakatifu na bado hawatambui kwamba wanaweza kupokea msaada kwa wakati wowote endapo tu wataitikia Neno la Mungu.</p>With the vast amount of people waiting to be healed, it is hard with the natural mind to figure out why Jesus singled out this man instead of healing the whole crowd. It is quite possible that Jesus knew that the others would not respond to a simple command of faith and that they were too wrapped up in the wonder of this sensational yearly miracle to be bothered with anything else. Many people are still this way; they look forward to special meetings and conventions when there is great moving of the spirit and yet they do not realize that they can receive help at any time if they would only respond to the Word of God.</p>
<pKwa sababu yeye ni mwana wa Mungu ajuaye yote,Yesu hakulazimika kuhojiana na mtu kupata historia yake,bali alikuwa tayari anajua yote kumhusu na ukweli wa jinsi gani alipata kuwa mgonjwa kwa miaka thelathini na minane.Kwa kumuona mtu Yesu alimuuliza je!wataka kuwa mzima?hii iliweza kuonekana kama swali la kigeni,kwa nini tena mtu adanganye kuwa kuna mwaka baada ya mwaka ikiwa yeye hakutamani kuponywa?mtu aliitikia kwa jibu zuri sana angeweza kulitoa kutoka akili ya kimwili,bwana sina mtu,wakati maji yanapotibuliwa,wakunitupia katika maji:buli ninapokuja mtu mwingine hunitangulia mbele yangu. .&rdquo;</p>Because He is the omniscient Son of God, Jesus did not have to interrogate the man to find out his history, but He already knew all about him and the fact of how that he had been sick for thirty-eight years. Upon seeing the man, Jesus asked him, &ldquo;Wilt thou be made whole?&rdquo; This might have seemed like a strange question, for why else would the man lie there year after year if he did not desire to be healed? The man responded with the best answer he could give from his carnal mind, &ldquo;Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yesu alimpa ahadi ambayo inazidi majaribu yote ya sababu za kibinadamu;zilizo inuka.Alikuwa anamwambia kwamba sasa yeye angefanya kitu ambacho hakuwahi kufanya kabla--na ilikuwa hivyo kwa kuwa Yesu alilisema neno.Sauti ileile ambayo iliumba ulimwengu bila ya kutumia chochote sasa inasema kuumba mara ya pili sehemu za mwili wa mtu ambao ulikuwa umeharibiwa.</p>Jesus gave him a promise that surpassed all attempts of human reasoning; that was &ldquo;Rise.&rdquo; He was telling him that he now could do the thing he couldn’t do before--and it was all because Jesus had spoken the word. The same voice that was able to create the world out of nothing now spoke to recreate the parts of this man’s body that had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Yesu aliendelea kusema;Jitwike kitanda chako na uende.Hii ilikuwa changamoto kwa mapenzi ya mtu kuinuka na kutenda kitendo.Alipaswa kuitikia kibinafisi kwa kile Yesu alichosema.Alipaswa kutembea yeye mwenyewe;alikuwa hapaswi kuhitaji mtu wa kumbeba.Msingi wa muujiza nikufanyia mazoezi mapenzi ya Mungu. </p>Jesus proceeded, &ldquo;Take up thy bed and walk.&rdquo; This was a challenge to the man’s will to arise to action. He had to personally respond to what Jesus said. He had to walk for himself; he was to no longer expect another man to carry him around. The basis of a miracle is the exercising of the will. </p>

<h1>#4 Bwana wa wakatiMaster of Time</h1>
	<p>Mara kwa mara tunaweka frem kwenye vitu na kusema kwamba Mungu hufanya kazi kwenye vitu hivyo au vitu vingine havitafanya kazi sawa (kama vile Martha katika Yohn 11:21),lakini Yesu alithibitisha kwamba ingawa mtu yule alikuwa mgonjwa kwa takribani miongo minne,ilikuwa bado kuna wakati kwa ajili yake kuponywa.</p> Often we put time frames on things and say that God HAS to work in them or else things will not work out right (such as Martha in John 11:21), but Jesus proved that though this man had been sick for nearly four decades, there was still time for him to be healed.</p>
</div>
<h3>MatesoThe Persecution 5:10-13</h3>
<p>Wayahudi walikasirishwa sana kwa sababu Yesu alimponya huyu mtu siku ya sabato,kwasababu kulingana na sheria,kazi hazikuruhusiwa siku ya sabato(Kut. 20:8-11).Adhabu kwa ajili ya kuvunja sheria hii ilikuwa ni kifo (Kut. 31:14-17)na wayahudi walitaka kutekeza hukumu hii(4:16).</p> The Jews were very upset because Jesus healed this man on the Sabbath day, because according to the Law, no work at all was to be done on the Sabbath (Ex. 20:8-11). The punishment for breaking this law was death (Ex. 31:14-17) and the Jews wanted to execute this judgment (4:16).</p>
<p>Kile ambacho wayahudi hawakukijuwa kilikuwa ni kwamba sabato ilikuwa imetolewa kama sehemu ya sheria ya sherehe,ambayo ingetimilizwa katika Kristo(Col. 2:16, 17). Yesu ni sabato kwa ajili ya nafsi zetu(Waeb. 4:9-11)na kanuni nyuma ya sababu ilikuwa ni kwa ajili watu kupunguza kazi kwa ajili ya kupata mapumziko katika utoaji wa Mungu.</p>
 What the Jews did not understand was that the Sabbath was given as a part of the ceremonial law, which was fulfilled in Christ (Col. 2:16, 17). Jesus is the Sabbath for our souls (Heb. 4:9-11) and the principle behind the Sabbath was for men to cease from their own labor and rest in the provision of God.</p>
<h3>The Precept 5:14-18</h3>
<p>Moja ya vitu vya kwanza mtu aliyeponywa baadaye aliingia hekalu kumwabudu Mungu.Wakati Mungu anapotusaidia na kufanya kazi katika tabia zetu,tunapaswa kumpa shukurani.</p>One of the first things the man did after he was healed was to go to the temple to worship God. When God helps us and works on our behalf, we need to give Him thanks.</p>
<p>Yesu alimkuta mtu hekaluni na kumwambia,tazama umekuwa mzima:Usitende dhambi tena lisije jambo baya likakupata.Mungu anaweza kutusaidia kuirudisha nyuma nguvu ya Iblisi kutoka maisha yetu,lakini kama tukitenda dhambi,hakuna kizuizi kwamba ile nguvu ya giza haitarudi katika maisha yetu kama tuta rudi nyuma na kufanya dhambi.Wakati Mungu anapotuokoa,hutuweka huru toka nguvu za dhambi,lakini bado tunauhiari na kama tuna tamani kurudi nyuma kwenye kifungo cha dhambi Mungu hatatuzia.</p>Jesus found the man in the temple and said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, thou art made whole: Sin no more Lest a worse thing come unto thee.&rdquo; God can help us and drive back the power of the devil from our life, but if we sin, there is no guarantee that that power of darkness will not return to our lives if we go back and sin. When God saves us, He frees us from the power of sin, but we still retain our free will and if we desire to go back to the bondage of sin God will not stop us.</p>

<h2>Maelezo juu nguvu ya uponyaji wa YesuThe Explanation of Jesus’ Healing Power</h2>

<p>Sura hii inashughulika na kipindi cha mabishano.Katika sura hii,Muujiza wake unashambulia na Uungu wa Mwokozi unashambulia.</p>This chapter is dealing with a period of controversy. In this chapter, His miracle is attacked and the Divinity of the Saviour is attacked.</p>

<h3>Mamlaka nyuma ya nguvu ya Yesu 5:19-30</h3>
The authority behind Jesus’ power 5:19-30</h3>

<h4>Mamlaka yaliyotolewa na Mungu 5:19-23</h4>
Authority given by God 5:19-23</h4>
<p>Yesu alijuwa kwamba kama asingelikuwa na nguvu alizopewa Mungu,hangeweza kufanya miujiza kama hiyo.Hakufanya kitu chake mwenyewe,bali kama alivyokuwa na umoja na Roho na Baba na yeye alifanya vitu ambavyo baba angefanya.</p> Jesus knew that unless He had power granted to Him from God, then He could not perform such miracles. He did not do His own thing, but He as united in mind and spirit with the Father and He only did the things that the Father would do.</p>
<h4>Mamlaka ya thibitishwa na ufufufo 5:24-30</h4>
Authority proven by resurrection 5:24-30</h4>
<h3>Ushuhuda wa nguvu za Yesu5:31-47</h3>
The witnesses of Jesus’ power 5:31-47</h3>
<p>Yesu alijuwa maneno pekee sio misingi yakutosha kwa ajili ya mtu kuamini katika nguvu zake na mamlaka kwa hiyo alisema,kama nitatoa ushahidi wangu mwenyewe,ushahidi wangu sio kweli.Sheria za kiebrani zilihitaji angalau mashahidi wawili kwa ajili ya jambo kuthibitishwa(Kumb. 19:15);Yesu aliendelea kuwapa angalau shahidi nne ambazo zilithibitisha nguvu zake na mamlaka ambayo yalimpa haki ya kimungu kuponya mtu hata siku ya sabato.</p> Jesus knew that His words alone were not enough grounds for someone to believe in His power and authority, so He said, &ldquo;If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.&rdquo; Hebrew Law required at least two witnesses for any matter to be established (Deut. 19:15); Jesus continued to give them a list of four witnesses that established His power and authority that gave Him the divine right to heal the man even on the Sabbath.</p>
<h4>Yohana mabatizaji 5:31-35</h4>
John the Baptist 5:31-35</h4>
<p>Kwa kurudiarudia Yohana mabatizaji alikuwa amewambia wayahudi kwamba Yesu alikuwa ni mwanakondoo wa Mungu.Yesu alisema kwamba wao walikuwa na hiari ya kufurahia kwa ajili majira katika nuru yake,lakini wao wakuwa na hiari ya kuendelea katika ile nuru.</p><h4>Matendo ya Yesu5:36 Ukweli ambao Yesu angeliweza kufanya miujiza ya kuponya ilikuwa ni ushahidi kwamba yeye alikuwa ni mwana wa Mungu.Mtu yeyote angesema kwamba wao wangemponya mtu,lakini inahitaji nguvu za Mungu kufanya muujiza kama huo.</h4>
Repeatedly John the Baptist had told the Jews that Jesus was &ldquo;the Lamb of God.&rdquo; Jesus said that they at first &ldquo;were willing for a season to rejoice in his light,&rdquo; but they were not wiling to continue in that light.</p>
<h4>The works of Jesus 5:36 The fact that Jesus could even perform miracles of healing was evidence that He was the Son of God. Anyone could say that they could heal a person, but it takes the power of God to perform such a miracle.</h4>
<h4>Mungu BabaGod the Father 5:37-44</h4>
<p>Labda ushahidi mkubwa wa nguvu ya Yesu ilikuwa Mungu mwenyewe.Shida ilikuwa,wayahudi hawakuwa na mawasiliano na Mungu;kama wangekuwa nayo,wangeweza bila shaka kujua kwamba Yesu alikuwa ndiye yule aliyejisema.</p>Perhaps the greatest witness of Jesus’ power was God Himself. The problem was, the Jews did not have any open communication with God; if they did, they would then without a doubt know that Jesus was whom He said He was.</p>
<h4>Musa mleta sheria 5:45-47</h4>
Moses the Lawgiver 5:45-47</h4>
<p>Yesu aliwapa ushahidi moja wa mwisho--magombo ya sheria na manabii ambayo wao walijifunza sana.Yeye alisema,mwayachunguza maandiko na ndiyo yanayonishuhudia.Waebr 10:7 inasema kwamba,katika sauti ya kitabu imeandikwa habari za [Yesu]na Yesu aliwambia kwamba siku ambayo walikuwa wamemwamini Musa na maneno yake kwa mioyo yao,kisha wangemwamini na yeye kwa ajili ya habari yake ilioandikwa na Musa.Kwa kurudia rudia katika Pentatuki kuna aina ambazo humwonyesha Yesu(i.e.  kondoo dume alishikiliwa katika kichaka,nyoka wa shaba,hema ya kukutania na zaidi)kama wangetafuta kujuwa haya kwa mioyo safi,Mungu angefunua fahamu zao kwa bila shaka wangejua kwamaba Yesu alikuwa kweli.</p>

Jesus gave them one last witness--the scrolls of the Law and Prophets which they studied so much. He said, &ldquo;Search the scriptures...they are they which testify of me.&rdquo; Hebrews 10:7 says that, &ldquo;In the volume of the book it is written of [Jesus]&rdquo; and Jesus told them that day that if they had believed the words of Moses with their hearts, then they would believe on Him for Moses wrote of Him. Repeatedly in the Pentateuch there are types that point to Jesus (i.e. the ram caught in the thicket, the brazen serpent, the tabernacle, and many more) and if they sought to understand these things with a pure heart, God would have opened their understanding so that without a doubt they would know that Jesus was real.</p>
