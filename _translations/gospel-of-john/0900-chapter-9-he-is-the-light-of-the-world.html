<h1>Sura ya 9: Yeye ni Nuru ya Ulimwengu Chapter 9: He is the Light of the World</h1>

<p>Tangia utangulizi wa Injili ya Yohana katika sura ya kwanza, tunaona ulimwengu kabla ya Kristo ulitajwa kuwa katika giza kuu la kiroho {Yoh. 1:5} na kwamba Yesu alikuja kuleta nuru kwa watu {1:4,9}. Hapa katika sura ya tisa tunaona Yesu anatoa maelezo kuthibitisha kuwa alitia vitu nuru na kuwafungua watu macho waliokuwa wamezaliwa vipofu. During the introduction of the Gospel of John in chapter one, we see that the world before Christ was alluded to as being in great spiritual darkness (John 1:5) and that Jesus was the light that came to bring a new day to mankind (1:4,9). Here in the ninth chapter we see Jesus give an illustration to prove that He could illuminate mankind by opening the eyes of a man that had been born blind.</p>

<h2>Mtu kipofu anaponywa 9:1-7 The Blind Man Healed 9:1-7</h2>

<divdaraja="onyesha yalioachwa" class="highlights left">
	<h1>#7 Mkuu wa msiba  Master of Misfortune</h1>

	<p> Si kwasababu mtu kipofu alifanya dhambi wa wazazi wake walikuwa wenye dhambi, bali taabu yake ilikuwa tu kwasababu kulikuwa na dhambi katika ulimwengu. maisha yasipokuwa ya maana, Yesu ni mkuu wa taabu zetu! Yeye anaweza kuchua hali mbaya na kuigeuza. It is not because the blind man sinned nor that his parents were specially sinful, but his misfortune was merely because there was sin in the world. When life doesn't make sense, Jesus is the Master of our misfortunes! He can take a bad situation and turn it around.</p>
</div>

<p>Siku ya Sabato Yesu alikuwa bado yuko Yerusalemu baada ya siku kuu ya vibanda, alipitia kwa mtu huyu kipofu jinsi alivyokuwa anakaa, akipenda kuomba sadaka kama mwanzoni ili kwamba akidhi mahitaji yake. Wanafunzi walipomwona, walimuuliza Yesu, Mkuu, yupi mwenye dhambi, mtu huyu, au wazazi wake, waliomzaa kipofu? Mara nyingi kinapotokea kitu fulani kibaya katika maisha ya mtu, watu wanadhani haraka ni hukumu ya Mungu kwa mtu mmoja mmoja ambaye alifanya dhambi. Wengi wanahisi kuwa kama mtu ni maskini na kuteswa, wale ni wenye dhambi, na kwa wakati huo huo, mara moja tunalinganisha utajiri na afya kwa baraka za Mungu. Hii ni namna gani Ayubu hakusikia wafaraji katika moyo wake na kwa kuwa walikumsema Ayubu; hakika kama Ayubu alikuwa mwenye haki ndipo uovu usingeanguka kwake {Ayb. 4:7; 8:20}. Ni kweli Mungu hufanya kwa wakati hutumia mwili kuhukumu juu ya watu {i.e Elima mchawi, aliye kuwa kipofu kwasababu ya dhambi zake, angalia Matendo 13:8-11} na pia aliwabariki baadhi ya watu, kama Ibrahim, kwa mazuri ya kimwili kama zawadi ya kuwa mtiifu. Lazima tutambue kuwa watu wote waliopa taabu siyo lazima waliadhibiwa na Mungu, wala siyo watu wote matajiri wamebarikiwa na Yeye. Tumeangalia vitu vyote viwili utajiri na afya za watuambayo ni ubaya na umaskini na watu wenye ugonjwa waliokuwa na haki "hali ya kimwili haina kiashirio cha ndani. Wanafunzi walidhani vibaya kuwa ni kwasababu ya mtu yeyote kati yao amefanya dhambi ndio huyu mtu amezaliwa hana uwezo wa kuona.  On a Sabbath day while Jesus was still in Jerusalem after the Feast of Tabernacles, He passed by this blind man as he sat, likely begging for alms just so that he could survive. When the disciples saw him, they asked Jesus, “Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?” Many times when something bad happens in a person’s life, people are quick to assume that it is the judgment of God on that individual for something that they did wrong. Many feel that if a person is poor and afflicted, then they are a sinner, and at the same time, we often equate prosperity and health with the blessing of God. This is how Job’s “comforters” felt in their hearts and expressed to Job; surely if Job were righteous then no evil would befall him (Job 4:7; 8:20). It is true that God does at times use physical judgment upon men (i.e. Elymas the sorcerer, who became blind because of his sin, see Acts 13:8-11) and He also blesses some men, such as Abraham, with physical goods as a reward for being obedient. We must realize though that all men that are being afflicted are not necessarily being punished by God, nor are all prosperous men being blessed by Him. We have seen both rich and healthy men that are wicked and poor and sickly men that are righteous—physical condition is no indicator of inward condition. The disciples were wrong to assume that it was because of any man’s sins that this man was born without the ability to see.</p>
<p>Yesu alidhihirisha kuwa siyo kwasababu ya dhambi zake, wala dhambi za wazazi wake kufanya azaliwe kipofu, bali ilikuwa katika hali ya kuwa kazi ya Mungu idhihirike. Yesu alifafanua zaidi kuwa ulikuwa ni muda wake kuzifanya kazi hizi,  kwani usiku waja hakuna mtu awezaye kufanya. Alijua kuwa punde atatiwa watu wa dunia na lazima afanye haraka kumtii Baba na kufanya kile anachotakiwa kukifanya. Jesus clarified that it was neither because of his sins, nor the sins of his parents that he was born blind, but he was in that condition that “the works of God should be made manifest in him.” Jesus further explained that then was the time for Him to perform these works, for the night was coming when “no man can work.” He knew that soon He would no longer be physically on the earth and so He had to be quick to obey the Father and do what He wanted Him to do.</p>
<p>Ndipo Yesu alipoeleza kuwa Kama mimi nilivyokuwa Ulimwenguni, nilikuwa nuru ya ulimwengu. Yesu mara zote atakuwa ni nuru ya pekee ya ulimwengu, Huyo hakuwa ile nuru bali alikuja ili aishuhudie ile nuru, ni zamu ya wakristo kutoa habari ya ile nuru na wao kuwa nuru wenyewe kuudhihirisha utukufu wa Mungu {Yoh. 1:8; Math. 5:14} Jesus then made the statement, “As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” Jesus will always be the only true light of the world, but now that He is now longer physically walking among men, it is the Christians’ duty to bear record of the light and thus be lights ourselves to manifest the glory of God (John 1:8; Matt. 5:14).</p>
<p>Baada ya mongozi hayo, Yesu aliwaagiza tena wawe na nguvu kuangazia watu. Aliteme mate juu ya ardhi na kufanya udongo, ambayo aliweka kwenye macho ya mtu na kumuamuru aende kwenye bikira la Siloamu na kuosha udongo ulioko kwenye macho yake. Kwa wakati huu Yesu hajamwahidi mtu kuona, bado mtu alienda kwa utii na kufanya kama Yesu alivyo mwamuru. Udongo ulipoondoka, ilikuwa ni moja ya tukio kwa wakati huo kwa mtu yule, kwani alipata kuona! Sio udongo uliomponya mtu macho, wala sio maji yaliyo kuwa katika birika, bali ilikuwa imani ya mtu iliyokuwa kwa neno la Yesu lililomponya mwili wote.   After He had spoken, Jesus again set forth to reveal that He had to power to illuminate mankind. He spat on the ground and made clay, which He put on the idle eyes of the man and then commanded him to go to the pool of Siloam and wash the clay of from his eyes. At this time Jesus had not promised the man sight, yet the man went forth in obedience and did as Jesus commanded. When the clay was removed, it was one of the most eventful moments for that man—for he could now see! It was not the clay that healed the man’s eyes, and neither was it the water of the pool, but it was the man’s faith in Jesus’ word that made him physically whole.</p>
<h2>Mtu kipofu aliulizwa 9:8-23.  The Blind Man Questioned 9:8-23</h2>
<p> Uponyaji wa mtu kipofu ulisababisha ghasia maeneo ya Yesrusalemu. Majirani wanaoishi karibu naye na wasafiri waliokuwa wakipitia kwake wote walishangaa kama kweli ni mwenyewe aliyekuwa mgonjwa waliomzoea. Uchunguzi walioufanya wao ni kuwapata watu bora kati yao kwenda kuuliza watu alipataje kuponywa. Wakati watu wakisimulia uponyaji wake, watu walimuulizia Yesu yuko wapi; labda kulikuwa na wengine walitaka waponywe, au walipenda kwani alikuwa mtu mgeni hivyo walitaka kufahamu yote kuhusu matukio yasiyo ya kawaida. Mtu yule hakuweza kuwajibu maswali yao, hajawahi kuona wakati alipokutana na Yesu na hivyo hakujua alikoelekea na hakumpa maelezo yake.  The healing of the blind man caused much commotion around Jerusalem. The neighbors that lived around him and the travelers that passed by him all wondered if this really was the same invalid to whom they were so accustomed. Their curiosity got the best of them and they outright asked the man how he had been healed. When the man recounted his healing, the people asked where Jesus was; perhaps there were others that wanted to be healed, or likely it was just the curiosity of humans to want to know all they can about unusual events. The man was not able to answer their questions, since he could not see when he encountered Jesus and thus did not know which direction He was heading and nor could he even give them a description of Him.</p>
<p>Ilikuwa siku ya Sabato, wakati ule mtu akipata uponyaji, baadhi ya watu walifikiri kuwa viongozi wa kidini lazima wajue kuhusu ule ubaya ndipo walimpeleka kwa Farisayo, ambaye walimuuliza yule mtu alipataje kuponywa. Mafarisayo walipomsikia Yesu walikubali kile alichokifanya na walitangaza kuwa Yeye hakuwa mtu wa Mungu hajawahi kuona siku ya kupumzika. Kulikuwako wengine ambaye hawakukubaliana na uongozi huu, hakuna mtu anayeweza kufanya miujiza ile haijalishi Yeye ni mtu wa Mungu. Since it was the Sabbath day when the man got healed, some of the people thought that the religious leaders should know about the offense and thus brought the man to the Pharisees, who also asked the man how he was healed. The Pharisees were angered when they heard what Jesus had done and they declared that He could not be a man of God since He did not observe the holy day of rest. There were others that disagreed with this ruling, for they felt that no man could perform such miracles unless He was a man of God.</p>
<p>Mazingira yote yale yalieleweka jinsi gani mtu huyu alivyoponywa, Mafarisayo walitaka kujua kuhusu mtu yule aliyemponya kipofu, kwa kipi kipofu alichodai kuwa Yesu alikuwa nabii. Wayahuhudi hawakuamini kukiri kwake kuhusu Yesu, wala hawakuamini ukweli kuwa mtu huyu ndiye aliyekuwa kipofu kweli, hivyo waliwaita wazazi wake kuja kwa mahojiano. Walitaka kujua kama huyu alikuwa kijana wao kweli, kama kweli alikuwa kipofu, na kama ni yeye alikuwa kipofu, namna gani alipata kufumbua macho yake.  Now that all parties understood how the man had been healed, the Pharisees wanted to know about the man that healed the blind man, to which the blind man asserted the Jesus was a prophet. The Jews did not believe his proclamation about Jesus, nor did they really believe that this man had really been blind, so they called for his parents to come for interrogation. They wanted to know if this was really their son, if he had really been blind, and if he was blind, how he received his sight.</p>
<p>Tunaye kabla ya kutajwa kuwa alikuwa anaogopa Waebrania ulioko Yerusalemu kuongea kuhusu Yesu na hasahasa kumshuhudia kuwa alikuwa Kristo kwasababu ya wale viongozi wa kidini wangesema au kutendw lolote. Ilikuwa ni kwasababu ya hofu hii wazazi wake waliogopa kusema kujibu, na walipothitisha kuwa ni kweli mwanawe, hatukupata habari yeyote kuhusu kuponywa kwake. Waliridhia kuwa amekuwa mtu mzima, yeye anaweza kueleza mwenyewe.    We have before mentioned that there was fear amongst the Hebrew people around Jerusalem about speaking about Jesus and especially about testifying that He was the Christ because of what the religious leaders would say or do to them. It was because of this fear that the parents vaguely answered the questions, and while they confirmed that this was truly their son, they did not give any information of how he was healed. They asserted that since he was a full-grown man, he was then able to testify for himself.</p>
<h2>Mtu kipofu anashitakiwa 9:24-34 The Blind Man Accused 9:24-34</h2>
<p>Mara ya pili wale Mafarisayo wakaongea na yule mtu kipofu hawkumuuliza yeye unafikiri nini binafsi kwa Yesu, lakini walimwamumrisha ampe Mungu utukufu na kukubali kuwa Yesu alikuwa mwenye dhambi kwani aliponya siku ya sabato. Basi yule mtu hakuthibitisha matakwa yao, na, akajibu kuwa, yeye ni mwenyedhambi sijui, najua neno moja tu kuwa mimi nilikuwa kipofu sasa naona.    The second time that the Pharisees spoke with the former-blind man they did not ask him what he personally thought of Jesus, but rather they commanded him to “Give God praise” and confess that Jesus was a sinner since He healed on the Sabbath day. The man would not conform to their wishes, and, while he admitted that he did not know the condition of Jesus’ soul, he also confessed that he knew one thing—namely, he was bind, but now he could see.</p>
<p>Mafarisayo walimuuliza tena jinsi gani alivyopata kuponywa na watu wakaitika kwa ari zaidi alivyosema hivyo, nimekwisha kuwaambia, hamkunisikia: mbona mnataka kisikia tena? Mnataka kuwa wanafunzi wake? Mafarisayo waliwasha moto tena kwa kudhaniwa kuhusishwa kuwa wanafunzi wa Yesu ndipo walidharau na kurudisha maneno makali kwamba mtu anaweza kuwa na wafuasi kutoka hapa kwa Walilaya, bado hatatokea mtu yeyote kuwa na wanafunzi badala ya Musa.  The Pharisees again asked him how he was healed and the men responded with more vigor this time as he said, “I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?” The Pharisees were ignited by the thought of even considering becoming a disciple of Jesus and they haughtily retorted that the man may become a follower of this Galilean, yet they would never be anyone’s disciple besides Moses.</p>
<p>Tunajua kutoka kwenye Maandiko kuwa Musa alisikia toka kwa Mungu, bali walisema kuwa hawjui hata Yesu alitoka wapi {hata kama urudie kuwaambia kwamba Yeye alikuwa si waulimwengu huu} They knew from the Scriptures that Moses heard from God, but they said that they did not know where Jesus even came from (even though He repeatedly told them that He was not of this world).</p>
<p>Yule mtu kipofu alijiuliza kuwa haijalishi kwamba hawajui historia au ukoo wa Yesu, lakini ukweli ni kwamba yule aliniyeponya nathibitisha ni wa Mungu. Alijua kwmba Mafarisayo wanaamini kuwa Mungu hawezi kusikia maombi ya watu wenye dhambi, kwanini hawakuamini katika kazi ya miujiza yake ile iliyobarikiwa na Mungu? Aliishia kwa kujilinda kwake kwa kutangaza kuwa, kama mtu huyu hakuwa wa Mungu, asingefanya chochote. Mafarisayo walikasirishwa kwa maungamo haya, wakamtangaza kuwa ana dhambi, na kumtenga kutoka hekaluni. The blind man argued that it should not matter that they did not know the history or genealogy of Jesus, but the fact that He healed Him should prove that He is of God. He knew that the Pharisees believed that God would not hear the prayer of a sinful man, why then would they not believe in this miracle worker that was obviously blessed by God? He ended his defense by declaring that, “If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.” The Pharisees were angered by this confession, proclaimed the man to be a sinner, and excommunicated him from the synagogue.</p>
<h2>Mtu kipofu aliongoka 9:35-41 The Blind Man Enlightened 9:35-41</h2>
<p>Yule mtu kipofu walimtoa nje kati ya watu, lakini hawakuwa na maana kuwa Mungu alikuwa juu yake. Yesu alimwendea na kumuuliza maswli ya kupeleleza moyoni, Wewe wamwamini Mwana wa Mungu? Mtu aliyekuponya ndio unaongea naye kuwa hata humfahamu kuwanMwana wa Mungu alikuwa nani, lakini kama wangejua na wangeamini. Yesu alimwambia kuwa yeye alikuwa ni mmoja wa waliosimama mbele yake na kuongea naye. Kwa imani alisema, Bwana, naamini! akaanza kumsujudia Kristo.   The man may have been an outcast among men, but that does not mean that God gave up on him. Jesus found him and asked him a heart-searching question, “Dost thou believe on the Son of God?” The man implied by his response that he did not even know who the Son of God was, but if he did know, then he would believe. Jesus told him that He was the One that was standing before him and talking with him. The man responded in faith and said, “Lord, I believe!” and he began to worship Christ.</p>
<p>Alipata kuona kimwili mapema wakati alipoosha kwenye birika la Siloamu, lakini sasa akapata kuona kiroho. Hiyo ni sababu kuwa Yesu alikuja ulimwenguni kufungua macho ya watu, roho ambazo zilizopofushwa na dhambi. Mtu anaweza kuingia katika milango ya mbinguni kwa upungufu wa kimwili, lakini kama kuna lawama yeyote katika nafsi yake ndipo hawezi kukanyaga mji wa thamani/ dhahabu.  He had received his physical sight earlier when he washed at the pool of Siloam, but now he received his spiritual sight. That is the reason that Jesus came into the world—to open the eyes of a man’s soul that had been blinded by sin. A man can enter the gates of heaven with a physical defect, but if there is any blemish on his soul then he will never tread the golden streets.</p>
