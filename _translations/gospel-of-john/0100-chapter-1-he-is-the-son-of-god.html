<h1> i Sura 1:Yeye ni mwana wa MunguChapter 1: He is the Son of God</h1>
<h2>YaliyotanguliaThe Prologue 1:1-18</h2>
<p>Mistari kumi na nane ya mwanzo unaweka mgawanyo wa kiufundi unaojulikana kama Yaliyotangulia.Yaliyo tangulia ni yamegawanyika katika sehemu mbili;ya kwanza inashughulika na Kristo alivyofunuliwa kama neno(mstr 1-14)nayapili inashughulika Kristo alivyotangazwa na Yohana mbatizaji(mstr wa 15-18).Mistr hii 18 ya mwanzo kimsingi ni uwakilishi wa utu wa Kristo pamoja na mstr kumi nanne ya mwanzo juu ya jinsi alivyo onekana kwenye macho ya mwandishi,Yohana aliyependwa,na mstr miine ya mwisho juu ya alivyoonekana mbele ya macho ya Yohana mbatizaji.The first eighteen verses constitute a division technically known as the prologue. The prologue is divided into two sections; the first deals with Christ revealed as the Word (vs. 1-14) and the second deals with Christ proclaimed by John the Baptist (vs. 15-18). These first 18 verses are mainly a presentation of the Person of Christ with the first fourteen verses on how He is seen through the eyes of the writer, John the beloved, and the last four verses on how He is seen through the eyes of John the Baptist.</p>
<h3oKristo alifunuliwa kama NenoChrist Reveled as the Word 1:1-14</h3>
<p>Mhula huu,Neno,lilitajwa mara nne katika mistari miwili mara tatu katika mstr moja na mara moja katika mistr 14.Katika Kigriki ni neno Logos katika(strong namba 3056)ambayo humaanisha kitu kinachoongea,kusema,habari,usemi.Logos pia haijatumika katika maana ya mazingira ya usemi wa asili,ila katika hali fulani,(kama vile hapa kwa Yohana 1:1-2)Inamaanisha usemi wa kiMungu au akili ya juu ya Mungu na inarejea kwa Kristo,ambayo ni nafsi ya uungu ambayo huwasiliana na mwanadamu na kufunua jinsi Mungu alivyo(Yohana 1:18); Luka 10:22).Urejeo huu wa Kristo kama Neno ni hau( msemo usio na maana ya maelezo kutoka kanuni za kisarufi za jumla ya lugha) na ni maalumu kwa maandishi ya Yohana <kufunga nukuu>Hapo mwanzo kulikuwa na Neno hii ni kuzungumzia kuhusu mwana wa Mungu au Kristo sio jina la Yesu ambalo lilitolewa kwa mwana wa Mungu alipouchukuwa ubinadamu.Neno (ni mwana wa kiungu wa Mungu)alikuwa na uwepo katika utimilifu wake wa utukufu wake kabla ya ulimwengu kuumbwa.(Zabr.90:2;Dan 7:9,13,22;Yohana 6:62; 8:58; 16:28; 17:5; 17:24; 1Petr.1:20; Ufunuo.13:8)This term, the Word, is mentioned four times in two verses—three times in verse one and once in verse 14. In the Greek it is the word Logos (Strong’s Number 3056), which means something said; speech; talk; tidings; treatise; utterance. Logos is not only used in contexts meaning natural speech, but in some situations (i.e. here in John 1:1-2) it means the Divine Expression or the uttered mind of God and is referring to Christ, who is the person of the godhead that communicates with man and reveals who God is (John 1:18; Luke 10:22). This reference of Christ as the Word is an idiom (an expression whose meaning is not predictable from the general grammatical rules of the language) and is peculiar to the writings of John (1 John 1:1, 5:7; Rev. 19:13).</p>
<h4>The Word and Deity 1:1-2</h4>
<blockquote>In the beginning was the Word&hellip;</blockquote>
<p>This is speaking of the Son of God or Christ, and not Jesus, which is the name given to the Son of God when he took on humanity. The Word (the divine Son of God) had existence in the fullness of His glory before the world was created. (Ps. 90:2; Dan. 7:9,13,22; John 6:62; 8:58; 16:28; 17:5; 17:24; I Pet. 1:20; Rev. 13:8)</p>
<p>Katika mstari huu tunaona mpango uliofanywa kati ya Baba(Mungu) na mwana (Neno)kwa kundi la maneno lisemalo Neno alikuwa pamoja na Mungu,kwa wakati huo huo haikani uungu wa Kristo bali zaidi inathibitisha katika kifungu kinachofuata na Neno alikuwa Mungu.Kristo ni sehemu ya uungu,na yeye sio ukamilifu wa uungu na yeye sio kiumbe duni au kiumbe bali ni sawa na Baba aliyeitwa kwa jina lile lile,misimamo ileile,hufanya kazi zile zile,heshima ileile,na wao wako sawa katika uwezo,ambayo ni uwezo wao na utukufu. nIn this verse we see a distinction made between the Father (God) and the Son (the Word) by the phrase “the Word was with God,” while at the same time it is not denying Christ’s divinity but rather affirms it in the next phrase “and the Word was God.” Christ is a part of the godhead, but He is not the entirety of the godhead and He is not an inferior being or creature but equal with the Father called by the same name, same attributes, performs same works, same honor, and they are the same in substance, which is their power and glory.</p>
<h4>Neno na uumbaji Kristo sio tu alikuwako kwenye wakati wa uumbaji,bali yeye alikuwa mtendaji wa kazi ya uumbaji1:3(Ef. 3:9; Col. 1:16 Mwanzo 1:1 inatumia jina la uwingi Elohimu(iliotafasiriwa Mungu)kwasababu sio tu inarejea kwa Baba,bali pia mwana na Roho,ambao wote walishirikiana katika kazi ya uumbaji(kumbuka matumizi ya viwakilishi vya jina "sisi"na "yetu"katika Mwanzo 1:26).Inaposema kila kitu kilifanywa na Yeye hiyo hairejei tu kwenye kila kifaa cha kiulimwengu, bali pia utaratibu wa sheria ambayo inatawala vifaa hivyo. The Word and Creation 1:3</h4>
<p>Christ was not only existent at the time of Creation, but He was also active in the works of creation (Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:16). Genesis 1:1 uses the plural noun Elohim (translated God) because it is referring to not only the Father, but also the Son and the Spirit, who both shared in the work of creation (notice the use of the pronouns us and our in Genesis 1:26). When it says, “all things were made by Him,” it does not refer only to every material object of the universe, but also the system of laws that govern those objects.</p>
<h4> Neno na Uzima 1:4-9 The Word and Life 1:4-9</h4>
<p>kristo {neno} sio pekee aliyoumba vitu vyote, lakini yeye ni mmoja aliyetupa nafsi hai. Christ (the Word) not only created all things, but He is the one that gives a living soul</p>
<p>Kwa mwanadamu. Adam alikuwa wa kwanza kuumbwa kimwili, lakini alikuwa bado mpaka Mungu alipompulizia pumzi akawa nafsi hai ambayo ikawa na ukaribu na Mungu {Mwanz.2:7; Ayub 33:4}. Adamu alipofanya dhambi, maisha yake ya kimwili hayakufa, lakini nafsi yake ya kiroho ilikufa. Ni Kristo ambaye anatukumbusha haya maisha ya kiroho kwa mwanadamu na kutuangazia nafsini mwake. to mankind. Adam’s physical body was first created, but it was not until God breathed into him that he became a living soul that could have fellowship with God (Gen. 2:7; Job 33:4). When Adam sinned, his physical body did not instantly die, but his spiritual soul did. It is Christ that restores this spiritual life to mankind and “enlightens” his soul.</p>
<p>Uzima ni nuru ya wanadam. Nuru inatumika kama ishara ya uzima kwa kupitia maandiko {Zab. 18:28; Mith. 24:20; Yoh. 8:12} lakini pia mwanga unarejelewa kama haki{ Yoh. 3:19-20; 12:25} na ufunuo wa maarifa {II Kor. 4:6}. Wakati Yesu alipokuja kwa maisha ya mwanadamu alibadili roho zilizo kuwa gizani kwenye dhambi kuwa mpya, viumbe hai ambavyo vimejawa haki na maarifa ya Mungu. “The life is the light of men.” Light is used as a symbol for life throughout scripture (Ps. 18:28; Prov. 24:20; John 8:12) and it also refers to righteousness (John 3:19-20; 12:25) and a revelation of knowledge (II Cor. 4:6). When Christ comes into a man’s life He transforms a soul that is dark with sin into a new, living creature that is full of righteousness and knowledge of God.</p>
<p>Na nuru hung'aa gizani; na giza hautauweza. Mwonekano wa Kristo katika ulimwengu unatupa nafasi kwa nuru kung'aa kwa kila mtu, lakini si kila mtu ataipokea kwasababu matendo yao ni maovu. {Yoh. 3:19}. hawakuweza kutofautisha nuru au hata kupeleka nuru kufifia, lakini wasingechanganya, na kufanya hivyo.  “And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.” Christ’s appearance into the world brought the opportunity for light to shine in the souls of every man, but not every man would receive it “because their deeds were evil” (John 3:19). They were not able to extinguish the light or even make it go dim, but they could refuse it, and they did.</p>
<h4>Neno na Ulimwengu 1:10  The Word and the World 1:10</h4>
<p>Neno la kiingereza ulimwengu limetumika mara 70 katika Injili ya Yohana katika KJV na linatumika kuelezea pande mbili katika mazingira ya kawaida ya mtu kiroho na kimwili.  The English word “world” is used 70 times in the Gospel of John in the KJV and it is used to describe both the physical and spiritual environments that man inhabits.</p>

<p>Neno kudharauliwa na walimwengu " Ulimwengu haukumjua Yeye. The Word ignored by the world– “The world knew Him not”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ulimwengu na watu 1:11-13. The Word and Men 1:11-13</h4>
<p>Wakati Yesu alipokua dunian kama Mesia aliye subiriwa kwa muda mrefu hakupokewa kwa vifijo kukaribishwa na watu wa Uyahudi kama ilivyo tegemewa, mbali na hivo hawakumpokea kabisa {Math. 21:33-46; 26:3-4; Luk4:28-29}. Pengine ndio walikuwa kama watu wake lakini kwa ujumla hawakumpokea, kulikuwa na baadhi ya Wayahudi, ambaye walimkubali Yeyena wengine toka mataifa mengine kama vile Wasamaria,{Yoh. 4} na Wayunani{Yoh. 12:20-21} ambaye walimwamini Yeye.    When Christ came into the world as the long-awaited Messiah he did not receive the warm welcome from the Jewish people as we might have expected, but rather “His own received Him not” (i.e. Matt. 21:33-46; 26:3-4; Luke 4:28-29). While His own people as a whole did not receive Him, there were some Jews that did accept Him as well as some people from other nationalities such as Samaritans (John 4) and Greeks (John 12:20-21) that did believe on Him.</p>
<h4>Neno na Kutwaa utu 1:14.  The Word and Incarnation 1:14</h4>
<p>Kutwaa utu ni tendo la kuuvaa mwili hai kwa haliya kiungu au kroho, na ndipo Kristo alichukua hali ya mwanadam na kuzaliwa kwake ni katika udhaifu wa chini sana huko Bethlehem. Japo hesabu ya kuzaliwa kwake katika Mathayo na Luka inahusu kutoka duniani kuangalia juu Mbinguni, Katika Yohana hapa anamhesabu anamhusisha anatoka Mbinguni kuangalia chini duniani; Mathayo na Luka wanaangalia zaidi asili yake ya kawida japo Yohana aliangalia umilele wa kiroho na hakumtaja mama yake, Safari ya kwenda Bethlehem, au nguo za kumfungia mtoto. Yohana hajalenga ni namna gani atakuwa mwanadam, bali ni kwanini Yeye alibadilika kuishi na watu na kuufunua kwao utukufu na mamlaka ya Mungu. Incarnation is the act of a living being embodying a deity or spirit, and it is thus Christ taking on the form of a man and being born in that lowly stable in Bethlehem. While the Nativity accounts in Matthew and Luke deal with it from earth looking up to Heaven, the account here in John deals with it from Heaven looking down to earth; Matthew and Luke look at it more from a natural perspective while John looks at it entirely spiritual and does not mention His mother, the journey to Bethlehem, or the swaddling clothes. John does not focus on how He became incarnate, but rather on why He became incarnate—to dwell among men and reveal to them the glory and power of God.</p>
<h4>Kristo alitangazwa na Yohana 1:15-18. Christ Proclaimed by John 1:15-18</h4>
<p>Katika siku zile kabla ya kuja kwa Bwana, kulikuwa na sauti ya ngurumo ya nabii ikisikika katika nchi ikilia kwa ajili ya kiburi cha kidini, kinyume na tamaduni za watu na kinyume na taratibu za dini zilizoko badala ya kuabudu Mungu wa kweli. Hii sauti sio tofauti na ile ya Yohana Mbatizaji, ambaye alitumwa na Mungu {1:6} kuwa mtangulizi wa Kristo. Yohana hakujitangaza mwenyewe au mawazo yake au dini, bali aliongea yale ambaye Mungu aliongea naye [Luka 3;2], ambaye ulikuwa ujumbe wa kutubu kwa kuonekana kwa Mesia {Mathayo 3;1-3}. Ujumbe wa ubatizo wa kumpandisha Kristo ulikaa vizuri kwa akiba iliyotolewa hapa katika Yohana kuliko hata ile kumbukumbu ilioko kwa Mathayo, Marko au Luka, kwa hapa hatupati kumbukumbu yeyote ya huduma ya Yohana Mbatizaji au ujumbe wake wa  toba, bali tunaona hotuba ya mleta habari  wa Mesia hotuba zake zote zinamhusu Yeye. In those days just before the coming of the Lord, there was a thundering voice of a prophet heard in the land crying out against religious pretense, against the traditions of men, and against the religion of form that had substituted the true worship of God. This voice was none other than that of John the Baptist, who was sent by God (1:6) to be a forerunner of Christ. John did not proclaim himself or his ideas or religion, but he spoke that which God spoke to Him (Luke 3:2), which was a message of repentance to prepare for the appearance of the Messiah (Matthew 3:1-3). The Baptist’s message of uplifting Christ fits well with the account given here in John even more so than the accounts in either Matthew, Mark, or Luke, for here we do not find any record of John’s baptism ministry or of his message of repentance, but we only see a heralding of the Messiah—all his speech revolves around Him.</p>
<p>Japo imefupishwa sana, ushuhuda ule uliotolewa na Mbatizaji hapa katika Yohana 1:15-18 unafanana sana na ule uliokwisha tolewa tayari katika mstari 1-14.  Though much condensed, the witness that the Baptist gives here in John 1:15-18 is very similar to that already given in verses 1-14.</p>

<h2>Kumbukumbu ya Yohana 1:19-34 The Record of John 1:19-34</h2>
<p>Baada ya maneno machache ndipo maelezo yenye nguvu kuhusu Uungu wa Yesu, kuwako kwake mbele na kuvaa utukufu, Injili ya Yohana sasa inamtambilisha Yesu kipekee katika utangulizi wake na ubatizo wa Yohana Mbatizaji. After brief but powerful statements about the deity of Jesus, His pre-existence, and incarnation, John’s Gospel now introduces Jesus in person by His introduction and baptism by John the Baptist.</p>
<h3>Nukuu ya Yohana alikuwa nani 1:19-28 The Record of Who John Was 1:19-28</h3>
<pHuduma ya Yohana Mbatizaji haikuwa ya kimya, haikuwa ya ubishani na hivyo ilikuwa ya kuvuta umakini kwa Wayahudi wakati anawaonya Mafarisayo na Masadukayo{ Mathayo 3:7} watoza ushuru {Luka 3:12}, na hata askari wa Kirumi {Luka 3:14}. Viongozi wa kidini walishangazwa kwa ujasiri wake na kutuma wajumbe kutafuta alikuwa ni nani ulimwenguni aliyekuwako na kwanini alikuwa  na mamlaka ya kusema vitu kama hivi.   >The ministry of John the Baptist was not a quiet, uncontroversial one and so it attracted the attention of the Jews when he rebuked the Pharisees and Sadducees (Matt. 3:7), publicans (Luke 3:12), and even Roman soldiers (Luke 3:14). The religious leaders were amazed at his boldness and sent messengers to find out who in the world he was and why he felt he had the authority to say such things.</p>
<p>“Ni nani huyo? walimuuliza Yohana, lakini hakuwajibu jibu la moja  kwa moja swali lao, bali aliwaambia nani alikuwa bado. Yeye hakutaka kuwahusisha mawazo yao, lakini majibu yao yote yalilenga kwa Kristo. lakini mwishoni alikija kuwaambia alikuwa nani, alikuwa bado katika mahusiano na Kristo "Kulikuwa na sauti iliyotumwa kutengeneza njia ya Bwana. Ikiwezekana njia ni hii, Yohana alikuwa na Ushuhuda huu ambayo hata Makuhani na Walawi waliojua Yohana alikuwa nani, lakini Mungu alifanya" mtu akatumwa kutoka kwa Mungu kutoa ushuhuda.  Who art thou?” they asked John, but he would not directly answer their question, but rather told them who he was not. He was not concerned what they thought about him, but all his answers pointed to Christ. When he finally did tell them who he was, it was still in relation to Christ—he was a voice sent to prepare the way of the Lord. It can be said this way, John had this testimony that not even the Priests and Levites knew who John was, but God did – a man sent from God to bear witness.</p>
<p>Baada ya kutambua yeye alikuwa nani { tena zaidi , hawakutambua alikuwa nani} walimuuliza yeye kwanini yeye alijihisi anahaki ya kubatiza watu {Wayahudi walimuuliza maswli kuhusu ubatizo, kwasababu watu wa Uyahudi mara kwa mara walisisitizwa kanuni za sherehe}. Yohana akapitia tena mara moja mawsali yao na kuwapa majibu yaliyo husiana na Kristo "alifanya kitu kidogo {kubatiza kwa maji} kulinganisha na kile Yesu alichokifanya {kubatiza kwa moto" Angalia Math. 3:11} When they realized who he was (or more, who he wasn’t) they asked him why he then felt he had the right to baptize people (the Jews asked the question concerning baptism, because Jewish people often often emphasized ceremonial methods). John once again bypassed their real question and gave them an answer that related to Christ—he was doing a small thing (baptizing with water) compared to what Jesus would do (baptize with fire—see Matt. 3:11).</p>
<h3>Nukuu kuhusu Yesu ni nani 1:29-31 The Record of Who Christ Is 1:29-31</h3>
<h4>Yohana alitambua makusudi ya Yesu 1:29 John Recognized Christ’s Purpose 1:29</h4>
<p>Siku baada ya haya maswali tumeona Yesu amemwedea Yohana, ni kipi kilicho fanya Yohana utangazaji wake kuwa maarufu, Tazama Mwana kondoo wa Mungu! Kichwa hiki cha habari kilimfunua Yohana kuwa alikuwa nabii kutoka upande wa Mungu kuhusu Kristo wamjue Yeye ni mfano wa Pasaka ya Mwana kondoo. Alijua kwamba Yeye hatakuwa kiongozi wa siasa amaye Wayahudi walimtafiti, bali alikuwa kama Mwana kondoo achinjwaye kwa ajili ya dhambi ya wanadamu wote,  na kwa njia hiyo alichukua dhambi ya ulimwengu.  The day after this interrogation we see Jesus come to John, at which John made his famous proclamation, “Behold the Lamb of God!” This title reveals that John had prophetic insight from God concerning Christ for he knew that He would be the antitype of the Passover Lamb. He knew that He would not be the political leader for whom the Jews were searching, but rather He would be as a lamb slain for the sins of all humanity, and thus take “away the sins of the world.”</p>
<h4>Yohana alimtambua Kristo kiUngu 1:30 John Recognized Christ’s Divinity 1:30</h4>
<p>Kwa Ufunuo toka kwa Mungu, Yohana alijua kwamba Yesu alikuwa zaidi kuliko jemedari, lakini Yeye alijua kwamba mtangulizi {Yeye ajaye nyuma yangu ambaye amenitangulia} "Yeye alikuwa Mwana wa Mungu aliyevalishwa vazi la mwili kibinadam. By revelation from God, John knew that Jesus was more than a mere mortal, but he knew that He was preeminent (He that cometh after me is preferred before me) and that He was eternal (for he was before me)—He was the Son of God robed in human flesh.</p>
<h4>Yohana  alitambua ofisi ya Kristo 1:31 John Recognized Christ’s Office 1:31</h4>
<p>Yohana hakujua kwamba atakuja kuwa binamu yake alipokuwa anatangaza wakati anaanza mahubiri, Lakini alijua kwamba kuna mtu atakuja kujifunua mwenyewe punde kwa Waisraeli kama Mesia. Yohana alimtambua na kumtangaza kwamba Yesu alikuwa hakika ni yule aliyekuwa anasubiriwa. John did not know that it was to be his cousin that he was announcing when he started preaching, but he did know that someone would come soon and reveal himself to Israel as the Messiah. John realized and proclaimed that Jesus was indeed the One for whom he had been waiting.</p>
<h3>Habari za Kristo Mbatizaji1:32-34. The Record of Christ’s Baptism 1:32-34</h3>
<p>Kumbuka , mawzo ya ufunguo ya Injili ya Yohana ni ishara, imani, na uzima na hapa tunaona yale mawazo yanayofanya kazi katika maisha ya Yohana Mbatizaji. Hakuambiwa na Mungu ni nani atakuwa Mesiz kwa jina, bali aliambiwa kwa ishara ambayo zitajifunua Mesia atakuwa ni nani. Ishara hizi ndizo ambazo Yohana alizoona Roho ya Mungu ikashuka kutoka Mbinguni na kumngojea kila mtu na wale watu waliokwisha kubatizwa kwa Roho Mtakatifu.   Remember, the key thoughts of the Gospel of John are signs, believing, and life, and here we see those ideas working in the life of John the Baptist. He was not told by God who the Messiah would be by name, but he was told a sign that would reveal who the Messiah would be. This sign was that John would see the Spirit of God descend from Heaven and abide on an individual and that man was to be the One who would baptize with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Pamoja hatuoni hapa thamani ya matokeo ya kawida ya Yesu Mbatizaji, tunaona thamani katika Injili zingine{kama vile. Math. 4:13-17}, ambayo kinakubaliana na kile kinachosemwa hapa katika Injil ya Yohana. Wakati Yohana anaona Roho inashuka juu ya Yesu kama hua aliamini kwamba Yesu alikuwa Mwana Mungu, nani alikuwa chanzo cha uzima ambaye Yohana alimtafuta.  While we do not see here an account of the actual occurrences of Jesus’ baptism, we do see detailed accounts in the other Gospels (i.e. Matt. 4:13-17), which agree with what is said here in the Gospel of John. When John saw the Spirit descending on Jesus “like a dove” he believed that Jesus was the Son of God, who was the source of life for whom John had been seeking.</p>
<h2>Kujiandikisha kwa Wanafunzi wa Yesu 1:35-51. The Enlistment of Disciples 1:35-51</h2>
<h3>Andrea 1:35-39 Andrew 1:35-39</h3>
<p>Yohana mbatizaji sasa anajua kwamba yesu alikuwa Mesia na pia alijua kwamba huduma yake mwenyewe imekaribia kuja. Siku baada ya Yesu kumbatiza Yohana alisimama na wanafunzi wake wawili {mmoja tunamjua ni Andrea na mwingine hakujulikana ni fulani}, Yesu aliwaacha, na Yohana akasema maranyingine tena, Tazama Mwana Kondoo wa Mungu! Huu ulikwa ujumbe wa Yohana kwa Wanafunzi kwamba huyu alikuwa ni mtu yule tuliyekuwa tunamzungumzia na hivyo tuanze kumfuata Yeye. Wanafunzi waliitika haraka na ghafla walimfuata Yesu bila mwingine kupinga  John the Baptist now knew that Jesus was the Messiah and he also knew that his own ministry was soon coming to a close. The day after Jesus’ baptism John was standing with two of his disciples (one we know is Andrew and the other’s identity is uncertain), Jesus passed by, and John proclaimed once again, “Behold the Lamb of God!” This was John’s message to his disciples that this was the man that he had been talking about and that they should start following Him. The disciples were quick to respond and immediately started following Jesus without any other prodding.</p>
<h3>Simioni Petro 1;40-42 Simon Peter 1:40-42</h3>
<p>Tunamwona Andrea amekwisha kuhesabiwa kwa Yesu naye akafanya haraka kumtafuta ndugu yake Simoni Petro akampa ujumbe, Tumempata Mesia {mpakwa mafuta} Kristo! na akampeleka kwa Yesu. Hiki ndicho tunacho hitaji kukifanya kama Wakristo 'Tumempata Mesia na tunatakiwa tutoke kwa msisimko na kuwaambia wengine kuhusu Yeye na kuwavuta kuja kwake.  We see Andrew coming out of his encounter with Jesus and hurrying away to find his brother Simon Peter and gave him the message, “We have found the Messiah (the anointed One)-- the Christ!” and then brought him to Jesus. This is what we need to do as Christians— we have found the Messiah and we need go out with excitement and tell others about Him and compel them to come unto Him.</p>
<h3>Filipo 1:43-44.  Philip 1:43-44</h3>
<p>Yesu alisafiri kwenda Galilaya alipoenda kumpata Filipo na kumwita amfuate. Filipo anajulikana katika Matendo 21:8 kama mwinjilisti, na alionekana kweli pale alipotajwa toka mwanzo wa uanafunzi wake, mara baada tu ya kumfuata Yesu alikimbia kumtafuta Nathanaeli na kumwambia habari zake, ambaye katika sheria za Musa, na manabii, walimwandika Yesu wa Nazareti. Jesus travelled to Galilee where He found Philip and compelled him to follow Him. Philip is known in Acts 21:8 as an evangelist, and he held true to that title from the beginning of his discipleship, for soon after encountering Jesus he ran to find Nathanael and tell him about “Him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth.”</p>
<h3>Nathanaeli 1:45-51.  Nathanael 1:45-51</h3>
<p>Nathanaeli ni kama hakufanya haraka kama wanafunzi wengine kuamini kuwa Yesu alikuwa Mesia. Mwitiko wake wa kwanza kwa matangazo ya Filipo ya Mesia alikuwa moja wa wale waliokuwa na shaka, laweza neno jema kutokea Nazareti? Mathayo Henry anasema mwitiko wa Nathanaeli kwamba, mashaka yake yalijitokeza kutokana na dharau.... kama alimaanisha kuwa Mesia, kwamba jambo kubwa zuri, haliwezi kutokea Nazareti, hivyo alikuwa sahihi {Musa, katika sheria, alisema kwamba lazima litatoka Yuda, na manabii walitabiri Bethlehem sehem yake alikozaliwa}; pale ndipo alipodharau ukweli wa mambo, kwamba Yesu huyu alizaliwa Bethlehem.  Nathanael was not as quick as the other disciples to believe that Jesus was the Messiah. His initial response to Philip’s proclamation of the Messiah was one of doubt, “Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Matthew Henry says of Nathanael’s response that, “His objection arose from ignorance.... If he meant that the Messiah, that great good thing, could not come out of Nazareth, so far he was right (Moses, in the law, said that he should come out of Judah, and the prophets had assigned Bethlehem for the place of his nativity); but then he was ignorant of the matter of fact, that this Jesus was born at Bethlehem.”</p>

Jesus gave him such a sign of His omniscience by revealing that He knew about his character and also about his physical location at the time when Philip came to him. These signs led Nathanael to believe and Jesus told him that if he continued to believe that he would “see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.” This speaks to us of the fullness of God’s power—the fullness of life.</p>
