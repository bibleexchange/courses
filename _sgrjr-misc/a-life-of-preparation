TITLE: When God Makes Experience Speak

TEXT: Proverbs 16:31

## INTRODUCTION

**Pr 16:31** ¶ The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness. <beautiful, honor, majesty>

**1 Timothy 5:17** -- **Let the elders** that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

ELDERS: older, senior

**THEME:** Each generation is in great need of those who have lived a life of preparation for a God given season of power. We want to be effective and influence for God and right, but remember it's God's plan and not ours.

A Life of Preparation for a God-appointed Season of Power.

## Examples of Prepared Lives (Lives leading up to a season of power and influence)

- Joshua under Moses
- Elisha under Elijah
- Isaiah 6 1) the coal 2) go and tell
- Esther

> Esther 4:14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and **who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?** 

## A Season of Power

- Jesus' public ministry was only 3 1/2 years
- Two Witnesses Revelation 11:3-13 

> **Revelation 11:3** And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. (3.5 years)

## Consider the journey thus far...

1) God Has Called You (Have you answered?)

How do you know me? Nathaniel, I saw you when you were under the fig tree.

2) God Has a Message for You to Deliver (only you will be able)

There have been alot of things about ME that hinder the flow of the Spirit of God. **But if I Consecrate my life to God**. Two Flames: The Man, The Message. God uses life with all its twists and turns to bring together the "man and his message" as one.

**"MADE OUT OF THE FRAGMENTS"**
A famous violinist once ordered a manufacturer to make for him the very best instrument his skilled fingers could produce. But when the violin was delivered, its tone did not please the sensitive artist. In indignation he smashed it.
The disheartened dealer tried to atone for his failure. Carefully gathering the broken pieces, he remade the violin and sent it back to the fastidious musician. This time the master was charmed with the tone, and was surprised to learn that the violin was the very one he had broken to bits.
"I have made it out of the fragments," revealed the proud manufacturer.

**Heavy, Hard to Process, Out of place?**

**WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH BEING USEFUL TO GOD?**

Illustration:** Rev. E.P. Scott, a missionary to India** tells of a time when he was trying to reach a savage tribe in the Indian subcontinent. Ignoring the pleadings of his friends, he set off in the dangerous territory. Several days later he met a large party of warriors who surrounded him and pointed their spears dangerously close to his heart. Expecting to die at any moment, Rev, Scott took out his violin, breathed a prayer, closed his eyes and began to sing, “All Hail the Power of Jesus’ Name.” When he reached the words, “Let every kindred, every tribe on this terrestrial ball, to Him all majesty ascribe and crown Him Lord of all,” he opened his eyes. There stood the warriors, some with tears in their eyes, every spear lowered. Rev. Scott spent the next two years sharing the love of Christ with the tribe.

## CONCLUSION

> Romans 8:28 And we know that **all things work together** for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

**When the scars of ALL THINGS are taking our focus**, remember glory in God and allow him to glorify himself in your life. There's crowd in the desert, somewhere GRATEFUL that Someone came prepared.

John 6:9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
