# The Study of the Word of God

> Jeremiah 3:15&mdash;And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

The ministry of the preacher is to feed the people with the truth of God’s Word. The preacher needs to be able to help people to understand the Bible. The preacher must first understand the Word for himself before he can preach to others. Nehemiah read from the book of the law, and then he explained the meaning to the people so they could understand God’s Word for themselves. This is what preaching is all about: proclaiming the Word of God in such a way that people can understand and receive the Word and then be encouraged to act on the Word. The goal of this class is to help the student learn how to study the Word. There is no set way of study; every preacher will develop their own style of studying the Scriptures. The preacher should develop a habit of reading the Bible every day. The preacher must know the Word before he can preach the Word.

## The preacher should understand the meaning of the passage

> II Peter 1:20&mdash;…no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.

### There is only one correct meaning of a Bible passage

The Bible is God’s message to man, and God knew what He meant when He gave man His Word. The Holy Spirit will help man understand the Word (John 16:13). Man will not receive the full understanding of the Word all at once. As the preacher prays, studies, and learns more of the Word, God will help him to understand more. The preacher should at least have an understanding of the passage he intends to preach.

### A key to correct Biblical interpretation is to understand a passage within context

Context is how a word or sentence fits in relation to the whole sentence or passage. The best way to understand the meaning of a word is to see how that word is used in the sentence.

### A dictionary can help the preacher gain a better understanding of the Scripture

There are reference books available such as the _Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible_ and the _Vine’s Expository Dictionary_ to help us understand the original Hebrew and Greek of the Scriptures. These books give the meaning of words in the original languages. The use of a common language dictionary like Webster’s can also help in understanding the meaning of words in the Scripture. For example, the word “servant” in Romans 1:1 is doulos in the original Greek language and it means “a love servant” or “one who chooses of his own free will to be a servant.” Paul is saying he is a servant by choice and love and not driven as he was under sin. Looking up the meaning of the word “servant” helps us to understand the right meaning of the passage.

## The preacher should compare Scripture with Scripture

> I Corinthians 2:13&mdash;Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

A Bible study method is to compare Scripture with Scripture. The Bible instructs us to compare spiritual things with spiritual things. By comparing verses with each other the Bible will be better understood. The Word of God will fit together like the pieces of a puzzle. One Scripture will interpret another Scripture. The Bible is in complete harmony with itself. There are no contradictions in the Bible. What God has written in Genesis will be in agreement with what God has written in Revelation.

### Compare Scripture texts on the same subject

A concordance is a book that lists the words in The Bible and shows were they are located in The Bible. Use a concordance to find Scriptures on the same subject. This will give you a better understanding of the subject being studied. For example if the subject of fasting has been chosen; you would look up Scriptures that contain the word fasting, fast, or fasted and read these Scriptures which will explain about fasting. This will give the preacher a Biblical understanding on the subject and give him a source of material to use in the pulpit.

### Compare how the same word is used in different Scriptures

A good way to understand the meaning of a word is to see how that word is used in the context of different Scripture passages. For example, see how “the Word” is used in John 1:1 and 1:14 and you will understand “the Word” refers to Jesus.

### The Scripture will explain itself as Bible verses are compared

The Word of God is in perfect unity in relation to itself. The verses in one Book of the Bible will support the same truths found in other verses of the Bible. One verse can help explain the meaning of another verse. For example:

> I Corinthians 12:13&mdash;For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body.

> Ephesians 1:22-23&mdash;And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church Which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.

Ephesians explains that the church is the body of Christ; also, by comparing these verses with I Corinthians 12 we understand that the “Body” is referring to the “Church” in both of these verses.

## The preacher should make notes on what he has studied

### Write down the meaning of new or unfamiliar words

Everyone will develop their own way of learning new words. Some Bible words have a different meaning in the original language than what the meaning is of those words today. One method is to keep a notebook of new words and Bible definitions; this will help you to be able to memorize these definitions. The more the preacher understands of the Word; the more that God can use in the pulpit.

### Keep the notes simple, direct and to the point

You don’t need to write a book to take good notes. Organize your notes into topics or subjects. Make a list of key Scripture verses that relate to your subject. If you use notes in the pulpit they should not contain all the material you have studied. Sermon notes should be very concise and organized. In this class you will learn how to prepare a simple outline of the sermon to use in the pulpit.

### Write down a thought or sermon topic as soon as you can

If you don’t write down something when you receive it you may not be able to remember it later. God may show you something in prayer or while you are reading the Word; these truths should be written down and kept so they can be studied and used later.

### It can be helpful to separate a Scripture into its main thoughts

A good way to study a Scripture is to break it down into the main phrases of the text. You can then study each main thought of the text separately. The goal of the preacher is to share one portion of truth at a time. Separating the Scripture into parts will help you to preach one part of the Scripture and then go on to the next part and build the sermon on the whole Scripture one piece at a time. For example John 3:16 can be separated into its main thoughts:

| Scripture Part                      | Topic to Study                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| For God so loved the world          | the **great love** of God—Loves ALL           |
| that he gave his only begotten Son, | the **great cost** of our salvation—the cross |
| that whosoever believeth in him     | the **great requirement**—faith               |
| should not perish                   | the **great escape**—no condemnation          |
| but have everlasting life.          | the **great reward**—heaven                   |

Looking at this verse part by part and studying it will help you to better understand the verse. This will also help you to preach this verse in workable pieces, one portion at a time. You will learn how to share truth in sections and build one step at a time.
