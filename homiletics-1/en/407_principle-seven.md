## PRINCIPLE SEVEN: THERE ARE NO CONTRADICTIONS IN THE BIBLE

God's Word is without error, it cannot be self contradictory. Where there seems to be contradiction, truth has not yet been found. Keep looking. There is perfect and unbroken unity from Genesis to Revelation. When interpreting a portion of Scripture, we must study its context. Not only the verses before and after it, but Scripture from Genesis to Revelation. My interpretation of that portion of Scripture must not disturb this perfect unity and harmony of Scripture. Let Scripture be its own interpreter. Remember, we are fully dependent on the Spirit of God to understand His Word (John 16:13; I Cor. 2:6â€“14). Ask God to show you His truth (James 1:5).

When establishing one doctrine from a passage, you must never displace any other doctrine of Scripture.
