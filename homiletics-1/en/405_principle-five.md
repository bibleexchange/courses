## Principle five: context is the greatest key to interpretation

This fifth principle is pretty much "all encompassing." Context takes in all the individual parts of the whole. The context of Scripture involves the placement of a verse within its particular chapter and book. Each verse of Scripture is profoundly important, but its importance can onlybe understood by considering its role in the paragraph, chapter, book, or even the Bible as a whole.

## We cannot properly study a small portion of anything without carefully considering the whole and the sum of its parts. Imagine how incomplete your understandingof airplanes would be if you were not educated in the natural laws. The flight of an airplane would forever be a mystery until you studied the airplane in the"context" of its natural environment wind, gravity, air pressure, et

Context is how a word or sentence fits in relation to the whole sentence or passage. The best way to understand the meaning of a word is to see how that word is used in the sentence.

EXAMPLE 1: Is it wrong to harass someone? We could not possibly correctly define the rightness or wrongness without MORE CONTEXT.

EXAMPLE 2: We know Hebrews 13:5 says Christ promised us, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake the" So, What did Jesus mean "I go away" in John 14:2If all we do is consider verse 28 and ignore its context, we will forced to conclude there is a contradiction found herBut, if we carefully include its context in our study, we will discover a clear and simple meaning. The manner in which Christ was with them (physically present) was going to change (present spiritually).

## A great key to correct Biblical interpretation is to understand a passage within its context. A complete understanding of the book the text is taken from is best.

A text taken out of context is pretext. A "pretext" is used to disguise the real motive and intention. Using Scripture as a pretext is using Scripture to say what you want it to say and not what God has to say. A text taken out of context is an abuse of Scripture.

The Bible contains an inspired account of events that occurred and statements that were made. For example the Book of Job records the conversations between Job and his friends. The conversation is recorded accurately as it took place, but the council of Job's comforters is not good council and should not be regarded as such.

The temptation of Jesus found in Matthew 4: 1--11 records the devil quoting Scripture to Jesus in vs. 6. The devil twisted the meaning of Ps. 91:11â€“12 to tempt Jesus to jump off of the temple. Jesus refuted the devil's misuse of theScripture by responding with another Scripture: Thou shalt not tempt theLord thy God Deut. 6:16

Daniel 3:29 ---Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.

Webster's definition of context. CONTEXT, noun. The general series or composition of a discourse; more particularly, the parts of a discourse which precede or follow the sentence quoted; the passages of scripture which are near the text, before it or after it. The sense of a passage of scripture is often illustrated by the context.

Webster's definition: CONTEXT, noun. The general series or composition of a discourse; more particularly, the parts of a speech which precede or follow the sentence quoted; the passages of scripture which are near the text, either before it or after it. The sense of a passage of scripture is often illustrated by the context.

"Taking portions of Scripture out of context and trying to piece them together is not a proper way of correct Biblical interpretation. For example the Bible tells us that Judas went out and hung himself (Mt. 27:5) the Bible also contains the words go ye and do likewise (Lk. 10:37) If someone were to try and piece these two Scriptures together the results would obviously not be good."

The context of how the chapter or passage fits in relation to the book being studied should also be considered.
