# The Theme & Thesis

## Introduction: The importance of a single idea

### FORMING AN IDEA

The word idea is from the Greek EIDO , which means to see and therefore to know . A synonym for idea is concept , which comes from the verb: to conceive. One definition for conceive is to create a mental image . Thoughts and ideas must be expressed in words. Preaching involves the communication of a Biblical concept. That means of communication is obviously the spoken word.

### EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION DEMANDS A SINGLE THEME

The theme refers to the main subject of the sermon. It is the main thought or idea that is to be communicated to the people. You will learn in this class that the use of one main theme was the Biblical pattern for the prophets and preachers. The prophets had a message from God; they declared God’s message with authority and precision. The sermons in the New Testament contain one single theme. The preacher must have a message from God. There is a difference between a preacher that simply picks a sermon to preach and a preacher that has a message from God. God is a God of order and timing. God has a message for the people; you need to know the message of God for the time that you will preach.

YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THE MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE.

The message will have one main thought or theme; the one point that God wants to impress upon the people that day. This is not about just trying to be intellectual or an orator. It is about receiving a message from God and then preaching that message to the people. The purpose of this class is to help the preacher deliver the message from God to the people. The message is expressed in words.

## What is Meant by the Term _Theme_?

### The subject upon which the preacher plans to speak

The subject will answer the question: “WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?” The theme or subject is simply what the sermon is going to be about. What is the message that God has for the people? This one message or subject is what is called the theme.

The subject of a sermon should never be only one word. Single words are too vague to form a complete subject. Single words like worship, faith and love are too broad for a sermon subject. The subject needs to be clearly expressed to form a complete thought. For example, there are so many aspects of love that could be preached in a sermon. You need to know what part of love you intend to preach for one sermon.

The theme should come from the passage of Scripture which the preacher has chosen for his text. As a rule the text naturally suggests the theme. The text is the portion of Scripture that is read before the sermon is preached. Remember that you are preaching the Word. The theme should flow naturally from the Scripture. The text should not need to be flung on the rack and tortured before the theme can be extracted from it. The theme should also be evident in the text as one of its ruling ideas. During the delivery of the sermon it is effective to frequently use the words of the text. Remember to preach the Word because your authority comes from the Word. “It is foolish to be lavish in words and niggardly in truth."&mdash; Spurgeon.

<!--NOTE: Webster's Tenth Edition defines the word 'niggardly' “to be grudgingly mean about spending or granting".  The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology traces the origins of 'niggardly' to the 1300's, and to the words 'nig' and 'ignon', meaning "miser" in Middle English.  (Nowhere in any of these references is any mention of racial connotation associated with the word 'niggardly'.)-->

### The theme expresses the purpose the preacher has in mind

The preacher should always have a purpose. There needs to be a target in view. You should not be shooting buckshot, hoping to hit something. Preaching should have the precision of a sharpshooter. If you aim at nothing you will hit nothing.

A clear purpose will insure only one theme in the sermon. There may be more than one theme in the text, but there should not be more than one in the sermon.

## The advantages of having a theme

### The theme insures arrangement in the sermon

A sermon should not be a collection of thoughts that have little or no relationship to each other. This class will teach you how to break the sermon into workable portions which will be preached one part at a time. These parts will be referred to in this class as the points of the sermon. This can be compared to preparing a meal and then serving it one course at a time.

The points of the sermon should always relate to the theme and progress like steps taken on a journey. You are building upon the theme one step at a time. You will advance the theme one point at a time with each point always referring back to the theme.

The theme should be kept in mind when preparing the sermon.

### The theme promotes unity in the sermon

Let the sermon be the one message that God has for the people. You are preaching one sermon and not several little sermons.

Let the theme be evident throughout the sermon. Would a late-comer be able to determine the subject of the sermon? Could the hearers answer the question: What is the preacher talking about? The theme should remain the final and ruling impression on the hearer's mind.

### The theme helps to give clearness of thought to the sermon

The preacher must clearly define his theme if he wants his sermon to be clearly understood. Do not aim at more than what can be discussed in the time given. “He grasps at the stars and sticks in the mud."&mdash;John Wesley

Narrowly define the subject to be preached. The thesis statement is the term used to refer to a complete sentence that clearly defines the sermon to be preached. This will be dealt with later. Keep the theme within practical limitations, deal with one aspect of truth at a time and try to save something for next time.

## Biblical precedent for a theme

### The Old Testament prophets’ messages were clear messages from God 

They had a complete message that contained one theme at a time. There was a specific purpose for each of the messages. The specific purpose was to persuade the people to return to God by warning the people of coming judgment and other prophecies of future events.

### Jesus preached well organized discourses and He is the supreme example of the preacher

A central theme is evident in the sermons of Jesus.

### The sermons of the NT apostles were proclamations of a single idea

The example set by the NT apostles demonstrated the importance of one major theme. The sermons were directed toward a particular audience and contained a singular message.

### Each book of the Bible expresses a unified theme

For example, Psalms is not incoherent and painfully random, but over and over again it expresses the vital elements of worship.

## The characteristics of the theme

### The theme should narrowly define the subject to be preached

It should not be too broad of a subject to be covered in one sermon. In a single sermon, one concise concept should be addressed.

### The theme should be expressed with clearness of thought

Use plain, simple speech while you are preaching. The theme should be easily understood by the congregation.

### The use of one theme is helps the congregation understand the truth of the Word

One main theme is easier to retain than many unrelated thoughts. If you establish a reputation for maintaining a singular theme, the hearers will rightfully assume each thought presented is related and better comprehend the message in its entirety. If the hearers think you are off-track or detoured from your theme, most of the time they will not fully listen but impatiently wait for you to get back to your subject. They will lose focus and interest if they think you are lost!

## The thesis statement

### What is the thesis statement?

The term thesis statement is used to refer to the one complete sentence that will define the subject to be preached. It is a way of expressing what the sermon is going to be about. It is the entire sermon described in one complete sentence. It is to let the people know where you are going so they can follow you. It is the theme expressed in a clear, complete and concise sentence—a sentence that will give direction to the sermon. The thesis statement will narrow broad subjects.

### The thesis statement completes the subject

A subject cannot stand alone. A subject needs a complement to be complete. A complete sentence needs both a subject and a predicate. This statement will add a predicate to the subject. You need to know what you are going to say about your subject.

* The subject answers the question: What am I going to say?
* The thesis statement answers the question: What am I going to say, about what I am going to say?

For example, a possible thesis statement for a sermon preached from Romans 10:17 could simply be: True faith requires a Word from God and then obedience to act upon that Word. This answers the question: what am I going to say about faith? The complete sentence (thesis statement) gives a focus for the sermon.

### The thesis statement is of great value

The thesis statement allows you to know exactly what the sermon is to be about. Put the message that you have received from God into one sentence. It lays a foundation for the entire sermon and will help you introduce the sermon. In one sentence, you will be able tell the people what you intend to preach. The people will know where you are going so they can easily follow you. It helps the people to retain the main subject of the sermon and answer the question: “What was the sermon about?” Since people are able to recall from memory a fraction of what they hear, a thesis statement packages the message into a memorable size so they can take the truth home with them.

### Examples of Thesis Statements Taken from Scripture Texts

* TEXT: Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus (Phil. 2:5)  
	THESIS: The believer must allow his thoughts to be in line with the mind of Christ.
* TEXT: Jesus wept (John 11:35)  
	THESIS: The unbelief of man grieves the heart of God.
* TEXT: How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him (Heb. 2:3)  
	THESIS: Those who do nothing concerning their soul are in fact rejecting the greatest gift and will not escape eternal judgment in hell.
