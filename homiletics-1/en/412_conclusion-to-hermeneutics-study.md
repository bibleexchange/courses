## CONCLUSION TO HERMENEUTICS

The preacher should make notes on what he has studied.

### Write down the meaning of new or unfamiliar words

Everyone will develop their own way of learning new words. Some Bible words have a different meaning in the original language than what the meaning is of those words today. One method is to keep a notebook of new words and Bible definitions; this will help you to be able to memorize these definitions. The more the preacher understands of the Word; the more that God can use in the pulpit.

### Keep the notes simple, direct and to the point

You don’t need to write a book to take good notes. Organize your notes into topics or subjects. Make a list of key Scripture verses that relate to your subject. If you use notes in the pulpit they should not contain all the material you have studied. Sermon notes should be very concise and organized. In this class you will learn how to prepare a simple outline of the sermon to use in the pulpit.

### Write down a thought or sermon topic as soon as you can

If you don’t write down something when you receive it you may not be able to remember it later. God may show you something in prayer or while you are reading the Word; these truths should be written down and kept so they can be studied and used later.

### It can be helpful to separate a Scripture into its main thoughts

A good way to study a Scripture is to break it down into the main phrases of the text. You can then study each main thought of the text separately. The goal of the preacher is to share one portion of truth at a time. Separating the Scripture into parts will help you to preach one part of the Scripture and then go on to the next part and build the sermon on the whole Scripture one piece at a time. For example John 3:16 can be separated into its main thoughts:

| Scripture Part                      | Topic to Study                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| For God so loved the world          | the **great love** of God—Loves ALL           |
| that he gave his only begotten Son, | the **great cost** of our salvation—the cross |
| that whosoever believeth in him     | the **great requirement**—faith               |
| should not perish                   | the **great escape**—no condemnation          |
| but have everlasting life.          | the **great reward**—heaven                   |

Looking at this verse part by part and studying it will help you to better understand the verse. This will also help you to preach this verse in workable pieces, one portion at a time. You will learn how to share truth in sections and build one step at a time.
