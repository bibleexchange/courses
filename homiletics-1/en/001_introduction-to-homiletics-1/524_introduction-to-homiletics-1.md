# Introduction to Homiletics I

Homiletics is the art or science of religious discourse or preaching. A homily is a sermon and the power of a sermon rests in its preparation. This class will help the student learn how to prepare sermon outlines and to preach. This class will not make you a preacher; only God can make a preacher. This class will help those who have been called by God to prepare for the ministry of preaching the Gospel.

You will learn how to organize what you have studied into one central theme or subject. The sermons recorded in the Bible have one central theme. The theme is the one main subject or thought which will be the main focus of the sermon. The preaching of one central theme is a **Biblical pattern**. This method makes it easier for the congregation to comprehend and therefore receive what has been preached. Good homiletics helps the preacher stay focused on the message that God has for the people.

## What is preaching?

### God's Method

Preaching is the spoken communication of Divine truth with a view to persuasion—to persuade and convince men of their need. The dictionary defines preaching as: _proclaiming or putting forth in a sermon_.

To truly preach is not just to talk about the Bible, but to produce a decision in the hearts of men. The salvation of souls is one of the main aims of preaching. Preaching is the method God has chosen to reach the souls of men. God chose to use man to reach man with the Gospel. Sinners will not come to God by the wisdom of man, but by the preaching of the Gospel.

> I Corinthians 1:21—For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

### God's Word

In the key verse of this class (II Timothy 4:2), Paul told Timothy to preach the Word. The preacher is called to proclaim the Word of God. The Word of God is the final authority. The preacher must settle every question with The Word of God; he must rest in the absolute authority of Scripture.

> 2 Timothy 4:2&mdash;Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

God's Word has the power to change men's lives and the preached Word is needed to produce that change. Man's ideas will not change lives. The preacher must use the Word of God as the foundation of his sermon. There is life in the Word.

> Romans 1:16&mdash;For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

The authority of the preacher is found in the authority of the Word of God. The preacher must understand the Bible is not the words of men, but is the inspired Word of God. The word inspired means God breathed. God inspired the writers of the Bible; that is, God breathed through them the Word of life. The Bible does not only contain the Word of God, but it is the Word of God.

> II Peter 1:21&mdash;For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

### God's Call

#### The ministry of preaching is a calling of God

Every man is not called to be a preacher, and sadly many trying to preach are not called of God. A preacher must be called of God.

> Ephesians 4:11&mdash;And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

#### Only God can make a preacher

This class will not make you a preacher. This class will help you to learn how to study the Bible, prepare a sermon, and preach what you have studied. All these tools will still not make you a preacher. Effective preaching is not just presenting many facts and truths of Scripture, but is a work of the Holy Ghost through a prepared vessel.

## Why Study?

> II Timothy 2:15&mdash;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

The preacher needs a right understanding of the Word for himself, so that he can proclaim the truth to others. This class will help the student learn how to study the Word and to understand the meaning of Scripture. The power of a sermon rests in the preparation. The preacher needs a message from God. The Scripture text should be chosen with much prayer and consideration. Once the text has been chosen the preacher needs to study the Scripture passage. The goal is to know where you are going before you get to the pulpit.

This class will teach how to prepare a basic sermon outline. An outline is a simple way of taking notes on the Scripture that has been studied. The outline is simple notes which make a framework for the sermon. A well organized outline will aid in the preaching of the sermon.

Every preacher will develop his own style of preaching and note taking. Some preachers will preach with no notes at all; others write out the text of their entire sermon. This class will suggest a simple method of notes for use by the preacher. Some preachers may use the notes only for their personal study and not use them in the pulpit at all. _Whatever method the preacher uses, he will need to study the Scriptures_.
