# The Text

## The use of the text

### The teaning of the term text

#### The term Text usually refers to the Scripture read by the preacher at the beginning of the sermon

It is the portion of Scripture that will be expounded upon.

#### The text may include more than is actually read

The sermon may be built upon an entire passage or chapter. The preacher may chose to read only portions of a lengthy text, or read through it as he progresses through the sermon.

#### The text is the Scriptural foundation upon which the sermon is built

The Word of God is the preacher’s authority (I Tim. 4:2). The Word of God is the final authority.

> II Timothy 3:16&mdash;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

#### The Latin word textus means the product of weaving or the web

The text is the fabric of the sermon. The sermon is woven around the text.

### The Reasons for the Use of a Text

#### There are Biblical examples of reading Scripture before exhortations

##### The Book of the Law was read prior to exposition (Neh. 8:8)

##### Jesus read from Isaiah before He taught the people (Lk. 4:16-20)

##### The Apostles used Scripture as a foundation for their sermons

###### Peter quoted from Joel on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:16-21)

###### Paul used Scripture in his preaching (Acts 13:16-42)

###### Timothy was admonished to Preach the Word (II Tim. 4:2)

#### There is historical precedent for reading Scripture before sermons are preached

##### The Synagogue setting consisted of reading a portion of Scripture followed by explanation and exhortation of the Scripture

##### The early church preachers read Scripture texts before they preached

##### Effective preachers of the great revivals expounded upon Scripture texts read before the sermon

#### The preacher’s authority is founded upon THE WORD OF GOD

##### The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation (Rom. 1:16)

##### God’s Word will not return void (Is. 55:11)

##### The philosophy of man will not save souls

### The Selection of the Text

#### The text should be chosen with careful consideration

Pray for the direction of The Holy Spirit when selecting a text. Also, consider the appropriateness of the text for the congregation to be addressed. For example, Song of Solomon 1:13 would not be an appropriate text for preaching to children.

#### Realize the needs of the congregation when selecting a text

Have there been recent personal tragedies that would make certain subjects very delicate? Remember, you are trying to help and not hurt. Sometimes you have to hurt someone to help them, but just because you are hurting someone does not mean you are helping. Much damage has been done by preachers abusing people with the Word of God.

#### Involve the Christian Church calendar when you select a text

On Resurrection Sunday people expect to hear a sermon about the resurrection of Christ. On Christmas, the day set aside to celebrate the birth of Christ, you can select a text that deals with the birth of Christ.

#### Current events can be taken advantage of in the selection of a text

National disasters can cause people to realize God’s power. You can show how Bible Prophecy is being fulfilled.

### The advantages of using a text

#### A text conforms the elements of preaching to truth and promotes attachment to the Bible

The text gives the preacher opportunity to explain Scripture. The text guards against un-Scriptural topics.

#### A text guards against rambling

The text will hold the message on track. The text will keep the preacher from wandering and getting lost. A good key to remember when you lose your place preaching or preparing is to go back to the text.

## The structure of the text

### The text should form a complete sentence

#### If not a complete sentence, the text must include at least a complete truth to be expounded

A proper text is never a phrase taken out of context. Portions of texts can be used to say almost anything. Correct Biblical interpretation is essential to properly using only a portion of a verse as a text.

For example, if a portion of Matthew 18:17 was used as a text:“If he neglect to hear the church, let him…”. This fragmented text could be used in a very wrong way.

“Verses of scripture should not be mutilated for the sake of obtaining a striking or sensational text.”

#### Keep in mind, one complete truth is to be expounded upon

The context in which the text appears must always be considered. This will guard against error. This will insure proper interpretation of the Scripture.

Examples of useable fractional texts:

* …the blood of the everlasting covenant… (Hebrews 13:20)
* …Whose I am… (Acts 27:23)
* …reconciled to God… (Romans 5:10)
* …unsearchable riches… (Ephesians 3:8)
* …thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece… (Zechariah 9:13)
* Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine… then that which is worse, but thou… (John 2:10)

### The length of the text is determined by the theme

#### Be certain the theme is expressed from the chosen length of the text

Not so short as to not clearly explain the theme. Not so long as to give more than necessary to naturally suggest the theme.

#### Short texts arrest attention

They are easier for the congregation to remember.

Be careful not to use a text excessively short that does not form a complete thought.

#### Long texts give fullness and authority

A complete foundation for the sermon. An opportunity to relate Biblical accounts to the congregation.

### Texts may be drawn from more than one passage

#### Complementary texts

The word complement means something that completes, makes up a whole, or brings to perfection. Complement is not compliment which is an expression of praise. Texts which corroborate or work together to explain a complete truth are complementary texts.

Examples of complementary texts:

* EXAMPLE 1:
	* “I am the door of the sheep” (John 10:7)
	* “We have access by faith” (Romans 5:2)
	* “We both have access by one Spirit” (Ephesians 2:18)
	* “Enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus” (Hebrews 10:19)
* EXAMPLE 2:
	* “A Faithful minister of Christ” (Colossians 1:7)
	* “I Paul am made a minister” (Colossians 1:23) (A minister of the Gospel)
	* “A minister of the church” (Colossians 1:24-25)
* EXAMPLE 3:
	* “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee:” (Isaiah 26:3)
	* “And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:7)

#### Contrasting texts

The word contrast means to compare as to point out the differences. Texts which reveal more than one side or aspect of a subject are contrasting texts. It is important to note that these texts are contrasting and not contradicting!

Examples of contrasting texts:

* EXAMPLE 1:
	* “for our God is a consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:29)
	* “for God is love” (I John 4:8)
* EXAMPLE 2:
	* “let us fall now into the hands of the LORD; for his mercies are great:” (II Samuel 24:4)
	* “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” (Hebrews 10:31)
* EXAMPLE 3:
	* “I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,” (Exodus 20:5)
	* “The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father,” (Ezekiel 18:20)

#### Parallel texts

The word Parallel means side by side, extending in the same direction, similar or corresponding. To compare is to show how things are alike. Texts of the same words used in various ways could be called parallel texts.

Examples of parallel texts:

* EXAMPLE 1:
	* The “ifs” of the eleventh chapter of John stand up like the successive peaks of a mountain range (John 11:9, 10, 12, 21, 40).
* EXAMPLE 2:
	* C.H. Spurgeon preached a sermon on the words “I have sinned”:
	* The hardened sinner Pharaoh (Exodus 9:27)
	* Double-minded Balaam (Numbers 22:34)
	* Insincere King Saul (I Samuel 15:24)
	* Remorseful Achan (Joshua 7:20) (Sorry he was caught, but not repentant)
	* Agonizing Judas (Matthew 27:4)
	* Job, overwhelmed by the righteousness of God (Job 7:2)
	* The repentant prodigal (Luke 15:21)

## The treatment of the text

### The textual sermon

#### Divisions

The prominent words of the text form the divisions of the sermon. Follows closely the words of the text, clause by clause. The text is taken apart into manageable portions, for the purpose of a thorough examination of the text. The text is not taken apart with a club, as a child might break up a watch. The text is taken apart with the precision of a watchmaker.

#### Success

The success of the textual sermon. Dependent upon the selection of the text. Certain texts are better suited to textual treatment. Other texts are best treated in a topical manner. Many texts can be treated in a variety of different ways.

#### Analysis

A proper analysis of the text. 

> **Analysis** separating, or breaking up of anything into its constituent elements; analyze - to take to pieces; to examine critically part by part.
> &mdash;Webster

#### Precise language

Division of the text in its precise language. At clear, natural breaking points within the text. A correct interpretation of the words of the text. The meaning in the original language (Strong’s, Vine’s). Considering the context of the word within the verse. Considering the context of the verse within the entire passage.

#### Distinguishing characteristics of this type of sermon

##### It should be natural and easy to develop a flowing of thought to thought

Do not force divisions at awkward breaking points. 

##### There should be a distinct advancement in thought

Each division should carry the theme one more step towards the climax. It is not always necessary to divide the words of the text as they occur, as long as there is advance of direction within the sermon itself.

<!--### The Textual-Topical Sermon

#### Divisions. The divisions of the sermon are expressed topically, but treated textually. The text itself still provides the natural divisions of the sermon. (Treated textually). The thought contained within the divisions is explained using words that expound upon the topic. (Expressed topically). The thought rather than the words of the text is made prominent.

#### Success. The success of the textual-topical sermon is dependent on a balanced union of two elements: 1) Proper analysis to determine the divisions of the text and 2) The theme (topic) of the divisions should be expressed in clear concise language . “It’s (the textual-topical sermon’s) success depends on the union of the analytical and synthetical elements in the mind of the preacher.” – James Pattison.

#### The word synthesis means a combination or putting together; combining of parts into a whole ; the opposite of analysis .Take apart the segments of the text with the purpose of putting the analyzed parts back together. There should always be an advancement of thought.

#### Distinguishing Characteristics. The textual-topical format ensures freshness and variety in the sermon. The preacher is held to the words of the text—guaranteeing a solid Biblical foundation—but is also allowed freedom of thought. Never forget that the preacher’s authority comes from The Word .

### The Textual-Inferential Sermon

#### Divisions. The theme is found in the words of the text. The divisions of the sermon are determined by the text. (Textual treatment). A series of inferences is drawn naturally from the words of the text. An inference is what could be implied by the text and also what could be concluded based on the words of the text. Some inferences drawn from Revelation 3:20 could be:

> Re 3:20— Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

Christ is on the outside, but has not abandoned His Church. He has not left her, but stands knocking. “ Behold, I stand at the door and knock …”

Christ is speaking something that the Church needs to hear, but as a whole will not listen. They have shut him out so He makes his appeal to the individual. “… if any man hear my voice …”

Christ will reveal Divine truth that will enable the individual to overcome and receive the promise of verse 21. “… will sup with him,…”

> Revelation 3:21— To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

#### Success . The success of the textual-inferential sermon is dependent on the choice of a text that lends itself to this type of treatment.“The text must be one from which a series of logical propositions can be drawn; and the sermon must preserve faithfully the spirit, and even where possible the very words of the text.” - Pattison.

#### The inferences must be clear, logical, and easily followed by the congregation. Proper Biblical inferences are not mere speculation without logical evidence. Any proper inference will not contradict any other Biblical truth in that verse or any other verse of the Bible. Textual inferences should have distinct culmination of thought. Simply, each inference must be meaningful and expressive of the intent of the context.

#### A lot of the success of the Textual-Inferential format is dependent on the mental capacity of the preacher. The preacher must have the ability to adequately present the facts. An argumentative and analytical mind is best suited to this type of preaching. This kind of sermon is very effective “at the same time analytical, synthetic, argumentative, and rhetorical, it commands respectful hearing.”- Pattison.-->

### The topical sermon

#### Divisions

The topical sermon is founded on the theme or topic of the text, rather than on the words of the text. The theme is most-prominent in a topical sermon. The divisions of the sermon are formulated by the preacher (which should be based on the theme.) The text should naturally suggest the theme even though the theme can actually be chosen first. The treatment style of the text will be rhetorical—clearly expounding on the theme. The topical sermon should be a thorough presentation of a topic.

#### Advantages of the topical sermon

##### It allows for rhetorical perfection 

##### It allows for a thorough examination of the theme 

##### It trains the mind to breadth of view—to look at the whole picture

##### The topical sermon greatly encourages considerations of THE WHOLE COUNCIL OF GOD

#### Distinguishing characteristics

##### Illustrative

This sermon type provides opportunity for illustrations and stories.

##### Climactic

The topical Sermon rises to successive climaxes reaching a well-defined conclusion.

##### Persuasive

The element of argument should be found in every sermon. Logic should never be sacrificed for rhetoric.

##### Progressive

The points are indicated, reached and reviewed. Plain direct application should be found in every sermon.

#### Success

The success of the topical sermon is dependent on the rhetorical ability of the preacher. He must be a student of the Word and able to give a well organized presentation of truth. The strength of this sermon type lies in keeping with the topic at hand. An acceptable topical sermon will be an exhaustive presentation of the theme where every facet of the gem is held to the light.

### The expository sermon

The expository sermon is a thorough examination of the text. This type of sermon is covered extensively in Homiletics III and will not be covered at this time.
