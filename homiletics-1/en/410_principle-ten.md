## A dictionary is a helpful tool to better understand the meaning of words.

### Looking up the meaning of words in a dictionary can help the preachergain a better understanding of the Scriptures.

### "The KJV is a pure translation of the Bible. The chosen English words are an accurate rendering of the original languages. One of the best tools to know the meaning of words is a dictionary. An older version of Webster's is a good choice since it holds true to the English meanings of the KJV."

## A concordance is valuable to find where Scriptures are located.

### Concordances such as the Strong's give the original language word in the Hebrew or Greek.

### "A word of caution: Some of Strong's definitions reflect his personal philosophy and opinions. Always consider word meaning within the context of the Scripture. Most of the definition sections of concordances give a list of possible meanings and uses of the word. Some preachers will pick the choice that best accommodates them without regard to context. This is not good hermeneutics. Use reference materials as a source, but not as the final authority."

### "A concordance is a good tool to locate Scriptures on the same subject.This will give you a better understanding of the subject being studie Remember the Bible is in perfect harmony with itselg. The use of other Scriptures will help you to gain a Biblical perspective on the passage orsubject you are studying."
