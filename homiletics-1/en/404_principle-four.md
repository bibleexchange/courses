## Principle four: read from the author's point of view

All Scripture must be taken from the author's point of view (2 Tim. 3:16). Consider details like, who was the author's target audience? Who wrote it? Paul, Peter, John the Beloved, Moses, or Mark? All of these people had different writing styles and different purposes for writing. The context of Scripture involves the personalities and characteristics of the authors. We would judge a record written by an eye witness different from a record written by someone with second-hand information.

### What was the historical context?

The context of Scripture involves the historical details influential at the time a passage was written. Paul wrote Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon from prison! Also, Paul was born in Tarsus the capital of Cilicia and home to one of only three great universities of the ancient world Athens andAlexandria are the other two. Paul was trained in Jerusalem under Gamaliel the great teacher of Jewish Law. Paul received the best education possible in hisday. He was no uneducated fool.

### What is the genre of the passage?


Meaning is Genre Dependent. The consideration of the many different Biblical genre text is so important to meaning. Epistles, Gospel, Apocalyptic, Prophetic, Parabolic, Poetic, Historical cannot all be treated in an identical manner because each is governed by a different purpose.
