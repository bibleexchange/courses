The Seventieth Week
Or
The Seven Years of Tribulation
Daniel 9:24

Seventy Weeks of years were determined upon the Jewish Nation.  Sixty nine of those weeks of years have already been fulfilled.  There is yet one week of years that must be fulfilled.  Seven years that God will again deal with the nation of Israel.  In between the sixty-ninth and seventieth week there has been a period of Grace in which God has dealt with all the world.

According to what I understand from prophetic truth there will be another world war in which God will fight for the Nation of Israel, as He did in the Old Testament, and this will be the ushering in of the Seventieth week of years.  As is often referred to as the Seven Years of Tribulation.  Before this World War the Bride of Christ (the overcomer) will be translated as is painly revealed in the scripture.  In Luke 21:36 “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to Escape all these things that shell come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.”  The Bride of Christ will be translated in the First Watch of the Night that is followed by the dark night of tribulation.  Where in the Church that has been sleeping will be awakened by persecution during this first three and a half years.  Matthew 25:5-6; Luke 12:35-38. “While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.  And at midnight there was a cry made.  Behold the Bridegroom cometh; to ye out to meet Him.”

I.	The Bible Teaches that Within this Seven-Years of Tribulation Several Things Will Take Place:

1.	The Antichrist will arise – II Thess. 2:3

Seals – Trumpets – Vials – Rev. 6:1 – 8:1; 8:2 - 11; 16:1 – 17
7.	The Wrath of God – II Thess. 1:7 – 8; Rev. 6:1 – 17

II.	The Bible Teches that there are Three Major sections to the Seventieth Week (The Tribulation).

1.	The Beginning of Sorrows – Matthew 24:8

3.	The Day of the Lord – Matthew 24:29-31; Mark 13:24-26; Rev. 6:17; Rev. 16:14.

1.	The Apostasy of the Church – Rev. 3:14-16
2.	The Revealing of the Man of Sin.  II Thess. 2:1-4
IV.	The Bible Teaches that the Great Tribulation begins in the middle of the Seven-Year Period.  Matthew 24:21; Rev. 7:14.

V.	The Bible Teaches When the Day of the Lord Will Come.  Rev. 11:15 “At the Sounding of the Seventh Trumpet.”  Rev. 6:17 “ For the great day of His Wrath is Come.”

2.	The “Epipheneia” – Eng. “Epiphany” – The Revelation – Luke 21:25-27; I Cor. 15:52; II Thess.      ; Rev. 1:7
