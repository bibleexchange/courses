<h3>A New King</h3>
<p>As prophesied in Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dream in Chapter 2, chapter 5 concluded with the fall of Babylon (head of gold) to Medo-Persia (breast and arms of silver). Medo-Persia was led by Darius the Mede who was 62 years old.</p>

<h3>A New Form of Government</h3>

<p>The &quot;head of gold&quot; is gone and the &quot;breast and arms of silver&quot; take over. Nebuchadnezzar ruled as an absolute monarch, but Darius&apos; regime is different. Darius delegates authority to 120 princes over the kingdom. Over those 120 princes were three presidents. The purpose of this structure was to give accountability and ensure the good success of the kingdom. </p>

<blockquote>vs. 2...the king should have no damage.</blockquote>

<p>First among the three presidents was Daniel. The reason for Daniel&apos;s preferment by the king was his &quot;excellent spirit&quot;. Daniel served God in excellence and the Darius noticed there was something pre-eminently different about Daniel. Daniel was honored by Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar and now Darius for the spirit he bore which was the fruit of a sanctified life. (Compare Daniel 1:8 and 2 Corinthians 6:17.)</p>

<blockquote>Daniel 6:3&mdash;Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</blockquote>


<h2>Conspiracy in the King&apos;s Cabinet (vs.4-9)</h2>

<p>Because of jealousy, the King&apos;s Cabinet was up in arms against Daniel. A conspiracy among the presidents and princes developed to remove Daniel.</p>

<blockquote>Daniel 6:4&mdash;Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>They searched hard to find some error, mental deficiency, or moral fault in Daniel, but could find none. In verse 5, the presidents and princes then conspired against Daniel by attacking his worship of God. A decree was made whose purpose was to trap and remove Daniel.</p>

<blockquote>Daniel 6:7&mdash;&hellip;whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</blockquote>

<h2>Reactions to the Decree (vs. 10-20)</h2>

<h3>In Daniel (vs. 10)</h3>
<p><b>No change in Daniel</b>. He opened his windows - kneeled three times a day and prayed. A capital crime. Why did he open his windows toward Jerusalem: I Kings 8:46.</p>

<h3>In The Princes (Vs. 11-13)</h3>
<p>The princes and presidents tattled on Daniel to the king.</p>

<h3>In Darius (vs. 14-20)</h3>
<p>&quot;Sore displeased with himself&quot; &quot;Laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him. &quot; The king must still command that Daniel be cast into the den. The king spent a long and sleepless night of fasting for Daniel.</p>


<h2>The Den of Lions (vs. 21-23)</h2>

<h3>Sent into a Den</h3>

<p>The Believer is sent into a dangerous and mostly godless world. The environment would appear too difficult for Christian faith to flourish and yet Daniel teaches us that even in a &quot;Den of Lions&quot; faith can excel!</p>
<blockquote>Matthew 10:16&mdash;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. </blockquote>

<p>No hurt came to Daniel because God sent His angel (&quot;El -aw&quot; strength: mighty Almighty) to shut the Lions&apos; mouths.</p>

<h3>Daniel Delivered Out a Den (vs.23)</h3>
<h4>The Reaction of the King</h4>
<p>Exceeding glad -&quot;Saggiy&quot; From a root means &quot;Laud Praise&quot;. The king Commanded that Daniel be taken out.</p>

<h4>The Reaction of Daniel</h4>
<p>There was no change in Daniel. Physically, Spiritually and Mentally Daniel suffered &quot;No manner of hurt &quot;.  The trial did not effect him because &quot;he believed in his God &quot;</p>

<h2>Righteousness Exalted (vs. 24-28)</h2>

<h3>The Counteraction Against The Cabinet (vs. 24)</h3>
<p>All the men who accused Daniel with their children and wives were cast into the den of lions. The lions had the mastery over them so that they brake all their bones in pieces before they came to the bottom of the den. This ferocity indicates that these were not old lazy lions, and Daniel&apos;s safety was not a coincidence.</p>

<h3>A New Decree (vs. 25-28)</h3>
<p>Darius made a new decree. In it he commanded that the God of Daniel was to be feared and men everywhere were to tremble before Him.</p>

<h4>The Honour of God</h4>
<p>Darius described God as &quot;Stedfast&quot;. He is supreme, immutable and omnipotent.</p>

<h4>The Prosperity of Daniel</h4>

<blockquote>Daniel 6:28&mdash;So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Prospered&quot; means to advance, break out or be profitable. Daniel prospered materially, socially and spiritually.</h4>
