<h2>VIII.Prophecies of Judgment and Dispersion -</a></h2>
<p>Literally fulfilled. Deut. 31:1617</p>
<p>Lev. 26-Dispersion - judgment upon the nations</p>
<p>Lev. 26:33-Became a byword - Deut. 28:37</p>
<p>Note verses 54-57 - all fulfilled in 70 AD.</p>
<p>Note verse 68 Josephus says that after 70 AD many went to Egypt to work in the mines. They became slaves - so many he says &quot;No man shall buy you.&quot; World-wide dispersion - vs. 64-67 </p>
<p>Jonah in the belly of the fish but not digested -type of Israel in all nations of the world but not absorbed by them. Lev. 26:44 Jer. 22:7-9. </p>
<p>Fulfillment of these Scriptures since Israel rejected their Messiah. Luke 23:28-31 Luke 21:24</p>
<p>Fires of persecution have burned fiercely in almost every century. Middle Ages - &quot;Black Death&quot; over 25 million perished.Spain France England Germany Russia etc.</p>
<p>Jews are the miracle of history. They never pass away.Moses at burning bush - it was not consumed. Type of Israel - amid fires of persecution yet are never annihilated. The Jews are the greatest witnesses that the Bible is the supernatural revelation of God.</p>
<h2>IX.The Great Tribulation -</a></h2>
<h3>Still future-before the promised blessings the Jews will pass through horrible times.</h3>
<p>·Moses predicted the day of &quot;Their calamity&quot;. Deut. 32:35-42</p>
<p>·Foretold by Jeremiah - 30:4-7 Day of Jacob&apos;s trouble</p>
<p>·Daniel also - 12:1 &quot;time of trouble&quot;</p>
<p>·Foretold by Jesus also - Matt. 24:21 &quot;the great tribulation&quot; is yet to come.</p>
<p>·It will affect all nations. It will be world-wide.</p>
<p>Why does God allow it? On account of their apostasy.</p>
<p>God has promised Palestine to the Jews. Palestine is the  Land of Promise They are to be brought back and restored. Whole-hearted return to the Lord - Joel 2:23 Zionism is a nationally attempted restoration of Israel. It is a restoration in unbelief. God has something better. The temple and its worship restored.</p>
<h3>The Two Classes –.Rom. 9:6 Rom. 3:2829</h3>
<p>Seed of Abraham has always been divided into 2 classes:</p>
<h4>·Isaac –Promise </h4>
<h4>·Ishmael&mdash;Flesh</h4>
<p>In the O.T. the Israelites who turned away from Jehovah and worshipped idols God judged. </p>
<p>A remnant always believed (faith and hope). Ezekiel 9:4Godly remnant Mal. 3. Hope of the orthodox believing Jews has never died. During the tribulation this godly remnant will accept the Christ and suffer for Him.</p>
<p>Jew&apos;s prediction - Matt. 24:14 The abomination of desolation in Israel&apos;s land during the Tribulation. </p>
<p>They bear witness to Christ and His soon coming to judge.&quot;All Israel shall be saved&quot; does not include the idolatrous God-blaspheming part of the nation.&quot; </p>
<p>Ezek. 20:30; 13:89; 12:9-13:1</p>
<h2>X. Israel&apos;s Future Restoration -</a></h2>
<p>The curses and threatenings the dispersion and the sufferings mean literal Israel and have been literally fulfilled. The predictions of the future blessing and glory have not been transferred to the church but will be fulfilled in Israel. Read Deut. 30:1-9. </p>
<h3>Outstanding facts in the above passage:</h3>
<h4>1. The future dispersion is assumed. Not the Babylonian captivity of 70 years nor the captivity of the 10 tribes. The dispersion of Matt. 21:24</h4>
<h4>2. If they return unto the Lord and obey He will have compassion upon them.</h4>
<h4>3. He will return.</h4>
<h4>4. They will be re-gathered.</h4>
<h4>5. They will be restored to their land and possess it.</h4>
<h4>6. National rebirth.</h4>
<h4>7. He will deal with their enemies.</h4>
<h4>8. The Lord will abundantly bless them.</h4>
<h3>These 8 facts are the basic facts of Israel&apos;s future.</h3>
<p>Blessing and glory.</p>
<p>Key to all is His return.</p>
<p>Hosea 5:15  ß All this refers to His Second Coming.</p>
<p>Acts 3:19-21</p>
<p>Note - &quot;the restitution of all things&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;all the prophets have spoken&quot;</p>
<p>Acts 15:14-18</p>
<p>Note the new fact - The Gentile world is to receive the Gospel witness before Israel&apos;s hope can be realized.</p>
<p>Calling of the church - when completed He will return.</p>
<p>Isa. 10:20-24; 11:1-4</p>
