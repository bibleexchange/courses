#This Time, Keep Your Shoes On
text: Song of Solomon 5:2-4, 6a

##INTRODUCTION - Shoes

- Ending the Pattern of Defeat. (We are More than Conquerors)
- There is no reason to hide. (Clifford the big red dog.)
- Prodigal Son Put Shoes on His Feet "Luke 15:22".
- Power and Authority, vs. Slavery and Servanthood [barefeet].
	- Moses at Burning Bush (Ex. 3:5)
>Exodus 3:5 PUT OFF thy shoes, holy ground Acts 7:33; Joshua 5:15
	- God is not blind, He sees as we are.
	- Moses did not have the ability to redeem Israel, but GOD did!
	- Even Though he wanted to (murdered the egyptian)
- A Season for Brokenness and a Season for Boldness. 

##I. UNREADY - Shulamite Lady (SOS 5:3)

####These Shoes are for a Covering

>Song 5:3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them

Keep your shoes on - Maintaining a State of Readiness

It is a battle, a spiritual battle
>Exodus 12:11 eat it, with your shoes on...[passover]

Do not enter that battlefield unprepared.
A state of readiness Or Maintaining a state of leisure.

>  2Ti 2:22 -- Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

My Testimony: Trapped in a rut...(Dad would say you can tell me anything.)

##II. UNWILLING - The Brother

>Deut. 25:5-10 she will take off his shoe, spit in his face before the elders...his name shall be called in Israel, THE HOUSE OF HIM THAT HATH HIS SHOE LOOSED. [refusal to marry]

- Stripping off the symbol of one's power and authority. A sign of resignation

>Psalm 60:8 Over Edom will I cast my shoes

- This is a ceremony of degradation
- Jews say it was not spit 'in' his face but 'before his face on the ground'
- spitting - strong contempt
- This law was part of a series of laws that kept Israel a PECULIAR people and SEPARATE from other nations. Preserving the line of his brother and perpetrating his brothers name.
- This distinction necessary for many reasons but one was to enable the messiah to be recognized by His tribe.
- to preserve the name and honor of another
- shoe kept by magistrate as EVIDENCE

- a refusal to marry
	- He has the LIBERTY to refuse

##CONCLUSION

>Song 7:1 - How beautiful are thy feet with shoes,...

- bro. Williams "My feets don't come off!"

###Never Quit Worshiping - We get in the flesh instead.
###Never Quit Feeding - We become weak.
###Never Quit Watching - We become unaware of the danger.

##ALTAR CALL

- His voice, his knocking, she put off, but

- Her heart skipped a beat as she saw his hand pass by.
