**@PM** LRR had taught the choir "Come Bless the Lord All You Servants of the Lord" and led them in singing it- Jacob Berry preached "God Has Been Good to You" [Had each camper 1 at a time stand before him and look at him and then look at a mirror of themself.] Children prayed, marched around the TENT, cried and worshipped for well over an hour. Prayed the best of the whole week. Several Testimonies afterward were given: 16 year old girl said she had been in church in the whole time, but it had been years since she felt God!

We ate and played basketball until 3 am. 3 Young preachers showed special interest in our ministry of the Word. Brandon, Andrew, Jacob. We talked quit a while about the things of the Lord.
