<h1>Overcome with Desire - (James 1:13-15; Psalm 27:4)</h1>
<p>Jas 1:13 ¶ Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:  14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
<p>Ps 27:4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>desire n. a strong feeling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>appetite, hunger, want, need, longing, taste for, love, lust, covet, crave</li>
</ul>
<h3>Eve</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Genesis 3:6&mdash; And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was <strong>pleasant</strong> to the eyes, and a tree <strong>to be desired</strong> to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>pleasant = a desire (Psalm 10:17; Pr. 13:12; Isa 26:8)</li>
<li>to be desired (Exodus 20:17; Deut. 7:25; Pr. 1:22; SOS 2:3)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Achan</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Joshua 7:20-21 I coveted them (Achan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2 Sa 23:15 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Solomon</h3>

</blockquote>
<h3>Nehemiah</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ne 1:11 O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often DESIRE what is harmful to us. It doesn't have to make sense, to be a very REAL feeling--I WANT IT! Desire turns to ADDICTION and satisfaction is fleeting. (Overcome with Desire)</p>
<p>Pr 1:22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p>AM I BROKEN? Well, yes, but there is cure!!! Fix it for me preacher.</p>

<h2>Where Does Desire Come From?</h2>
<p><strong>Desire is a symptom of the heart condition.</strong> As a desire for water is a sympton of a thirsty body, so desires of a moral nature are symptons of the condition of the heart. </p>
<p>Our desires are revealing of the condition of our heart. Cravings are symptons of deficiencies and conditions. How deep does the Lord's influence run in my life? </p>
<p>My heart is conditioned to desire, to long, to want. </p>
<p>The devil can wave it in front of me, but if I don't WANT it, he is wasting his time!</p>
<p>What am I allowing to CONDITION me to desire? (Advertising, Messaging, &quot;ILLUST. of logo design and messaging&quot;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Genesis 13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and <strong>pitched his tent toward Sodom</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God made us with our senses and desires. Sin perverts them and the influence of Christ redeems and restores them.</p>
<blockquote>Ps 139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>If you could just take that tenacity you use to serve the devil and turn it toward serving God, you would be unstoppable.</p>

<h2>How to Defeat an Evil Desire?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Pr 23:6 ¶ Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Desire is a sympton, don't band-aid, hide, cover up the sympton. It's a red flag something is wrong of great impact. <strong>Seek Deliverance -- Go After It!!!</strong></p>
<h3>Desires snowball --</h3>
<p>John 4:13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into</p>
<h3>Instead of your heart, let God's Word GUIDE us:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 2:22 ¶ Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Nail it to the cross. Confront your heart with the sacrifice of Christ's innocence.</h3>
<h3>Every craving begins with a cue. (a trigger, a smell, a sight, a sensation, a memory)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limit satan's access to your heart. </li>
<li>Limit your flesh's access to its lusts (get out of town, cut it off)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pure Desires</h2>
<p>The best defense is a good offense. Substitute negative desires with that which is wholesome. Find the ALTERNATIVE.</p>
<h3>DESIRING what is right, begins with DENYING yourself.</h3>
<p>Mt 16:24 ¶ Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</p>
<h3>The School of Christ</h3>
<p>Php 4:11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</p>
<h3>Put God's Provision to Work in Your Life!</h3>
<p>Ps 34:8 <strong>O taste and see</strong> that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.</p>
<p>Ps 10:17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: <strong>thou wilt prepare their heart</strong>, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</p>
