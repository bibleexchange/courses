# Magnify the Lord with Me

Psalm 34:3

## Psalm 34
1 {A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.} I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.
3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
5 They looked unto him, and were lightened:and their faces were not ashamed.
6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.
10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.
11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.
16 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.

## Song

O magnify the Lord, For He is worthy To be praised
O magnify the Lord, For He is worthy To be praised

Hosanna Blessed be the Rock, 
Blessed be the Rock, Of my Salvation

Bro. McLain "America, Make God Great Again!"

## Magnify!

The word "magnify' means literally "to make great," and then, to make great in the view of the mind, or to regard and treat as great. 

To magnify, or exalt, “do not mean that we can add any thing to the glory of the name or nature of God; but that 
- we should show forth, and publicly celebrate his majesty and greatness."
- bring attention to His goodness!

> Psalm 30:1&mdash;I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

1 Samuel 2:7 &mdash;The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts. 

God exalts the humble by delivering them out of danger and into safety, While man's response is to exalt God by proclaiming God's supreme exaltedness.

"He is High and lifted up!" 

> Isaiah 6:1&mdash;In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

Proclaim God's supreme exaltedness. Ascribe Greatness

## Harmonious Praise

"Join Your Praises with Mine"
ALIKE -- All without exception
TOGETHER -- "Maybe not all in the same place, but with the same heart let our praise reach the ear of God as one!"

David had fled from King Saul and was not safe to return to Jerusalem.

> 1 Samuel 21:10-15&mdash; And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 11 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 12 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 13 And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. 

David could not just got to the place of worship in Jerusalem and yet he could still call for the WORSHIPPERS OF GOD TO COME MAGNIFY GOD TOGETHER.

## The Humble

David makes his plea to the HUMBLE! v.2 "humble shall hear thereof and be glad"

As only they can truly appreciate David's request. The Humble share a common experiences of trial, loss and through that the Goodness of God. So they also should share in PRAISE of God!

TESTIMONIES:

- Horatio Spafford "It is Well"

This hymn was written after traumatic events in Spafford's life. The first was the death of his son at the age of 2 and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which ruined him financially. he sent the family ahead to Europe while he was delayed on business. While crossing the Atlantic, the ship sank rapidly after a collision with a sea vessel, the Loch Earn, and all four of Spafford's daughters died. His wife Anna survived and sent him the now famous telegram, "Saved alone …". 

The Spaffords later had three more children. On February 11, 1880, their son, Horatio Goertner Spafford, died at the age of four, of scarlet fever. Their Presbyterian church regarded their tragedy as DIVINE PUNISHMENT. "What had the Spaffords done that God could visit such misfortunes upon them?" In response, the Spaffords left the church Horatio has help start and started a new fellowship, dubbed "the Overcomers" by American press. Who ultimoately mooved to Jerusalem, the fellowhsip there grew to a couple hundred and they worked with the poor and needy.

## To Whom do we Give the Credit? TESTIFY

v.4 "he Heard me and delivered ..."
v. 6 THIS POOR MAN CRIED
v.8 "taste and see that the Lord is good"
v.17 "delivereth them out of all their troubles"

## The Courage of Praise and Prayer, v. 4

David appears faultness when you read his psalms of praise. But he was not without his weakness. HIs key to greatness was that his prayers silenced his fears.
David did not wait till the threat was passed to pray, but sought the Lord in his trouble and God delivered from his fear.
