# Foundational or Marginal?
TEXT: Hebrews 2:1-3

Heb 2:1-3&mdash;Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. 2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; 3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;

## Introduction

What is the Bible and what should we do with it? Modern Christianity tends to a pattern where the Bible is in practice, left to collect dust.

In the Margin, Sidelined, An Afterthought

**Philosophy driven Christianity** is a shortcut that comes with a price. "Follow your heart" - "It's okay, everyone else is doing it" - "If it feels good, its ok" - "God understands your heart, even if you miss the mark" - "Name it and claim it" - “God helps those who help themselves.”

	- The Emergent Church
	- Purpose Driven Life
	- Third Wave Movement
	- Prosperity Gospel
	- Entertaining Instead of Educating Believers
	- Returning to Mysticism and Symbols instead of a genuine life in the Spirit. (the cross as a charm, the communion as the instrument of atonement)
	- "You have to get down to their level" In a time when we still dress up for weddings, graduations and alot of jobs, **evidently worship no longer counts as that significant to merit respectful dress**.

> Isa 59:14 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.

> 2 Th 2:10 ... they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

> Ps 51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

The danger in mishandling the Word and it not given a proper role in our life is at best an anemic christian experience and at worst apostasy.

The sidelining of the Word hasn't been entirely on purpose. The agenda of the spirit of error, is an overwhelming influence when we marginalize God's Word.

## What is the Bible?

### The Disclosing of God's Will

> Re 1:11 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. Jer 30:2; Jer 36:2;

### His Word is a Witness/Testimony

> Ex 17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

> Isa 30:8 ¶ Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

As a Divine Record it testifies for truth which depending on how we respond to truth, will be a witness for or against us.

### A Revelation of God Himself

> Jeremiah 2:8&mdash;The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.

**...they that handle the law knew me not:...**

> John 5:39&mdash;Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.

### For our Education and Edification in Righteousness

> 2 Timothy 3:16&mdash;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

Heeding the Words of this book will bring you closer to God and through mixing faith with its promises we are receive the righteousness of God.

> 2 Timothy 2:19 ¶ Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

### A Covenant Filled with Promises

> 1 Chronicles 16:15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;

## What Should We Do with the Bible?

### Read It

> Hab 2:2 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

### Memorize It & Believe It

Ps 119:11 ¶ Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. (to hoard; to keep in place; "hide it so as to preserve it place")

Receive it. Its for me. It involves me and effects me. Take it to heart and make it part of me.

### Understand It

Good study habits are a bulwark (a defensive wall) against be led into error. Our approach to Bible study should not be similar to our approach to a textbook, but our study of God's word should be considered an act of worship --- not of knowledge of the God of truth.

Acts 17:10-11&mdash; And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto **Berea**: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. 11  These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.

### Share It

#### teaching, preaching, 

Share it in the same spirit in which God gave it to us.

Ephesians 4:15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:

> "The Jesus that men want to see is not the Jesus they really need to see." &mdash;G. Campbell Morgan

> Malachi 2:1-2,7&mdash; ...priests, this commandment is for you. 2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, ...  v.7  For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.

-----------------------------

1. Forgiven of Past, Present and Future sins. (**OSAS**)
2. **Overemphasis of Prosperity** - vs. strangers, in it but not a part of it
3. Grace as a **license to sin**. The "Permissive Will of God"
4. Rejection of an **absolute Standard**, Law, Absolute Principles -- everything is subjective
5. **Deification of Man** - Much modern preacher does more to improve your awareness of your self than does your awareness of God. Such a theology places ME at the center and not Christ.

-----------------------------

#### Conversation

> Proverbs 8:7&mdash;For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 

> Eph 5:19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody **in your heart to the Lord**;

#### Singing

Let our music be of a quality that it inspires faith in God. There is no better way to build faith than through the testimony of God's Word.

Often we rebuke operating in the "soulish realm" when it comes to music. The rebuke is against music that merely opens the well of our emotions without opening a connection with God. This music connects us with our self in a deeper way and encourages self-worship. 

The key to victory, peace and liberty is not IN us! It is in God. We sanctify our soul through holy song. What is a holy Song?

##### The Minister (Who is creating the song)

Everything matters to God. God's ministers are to be sanctified.

>  Romans 15:16&mdash;That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

Are the ministers we expose our hidden man to, ministering light?

Our song is to be a testimony of an experience with God. 

---------------
God’s not dead, [no] He is alive 
God’s not dead, [no] He is alive 
God’s not dead, [no] He is alive

I feel him in my hands 
I feel him in my feet 
I feel him in my heart 
I feel him in my soul 
I feel him all over me

An Experience empty song is dangerous because encourages us to equate what we FEEL by the movement of the song with the presence of God.

Bound in chains but exultant that "this is the best it gets." Israel was right to hang up the heart until they could sing the song of FAITH.

> John 17:17&mdash;Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

----------------

##### The Mood / the Spirit

Every genre of music has a particular mood that is characteristic to it. Christian music should be composed in a balanced way. 

Balanced meaning, it should be reigned in when:
- the joy crosses the line into a showing of the FLESH.
- the conviction crosses the line into depressing sounds
- A free and liberated spirit crosses the line into harshness and border line rebellion (rock and roll)
- When consecration crosses the line into DESPERATION. God does not respond to ANXIETY but the Obedience of Faith.

##### The Words - The WORD - Not just sound good, must speak the WORD of God faithfully

---------------------------
OBVIOUS: Irreverence in Christian song is never acceptable worship.

**The Drinking Song**
If you feel too serious and kind of blue, I've got a suggestion, just the thing for you! It's a little unconventional, but so much fun, That you won't even mind when people think you're dumb! Just come to the party God is throwing right now, We can all lighten up and show the pagans how Christians have more fun and keep everyone guessing, Since the Holy Ghost sent us the Toronto blessing! 

...the Holy Ghost's got me, and I'm out of control! Now I'm just a party animal grazing at God's trough, I'm a Jesus junkie, and I can't get enough! I'm an alcoholic for that great New Wine, 'Cause the Holy Ghost is pouring, and I'm drinking all the time! Now I laugh like an idiot and bark like a dog, If I don't sober up, I'll likely hop like a frog! ....

----------------

We should be frequently re-evaluating our song. The following examples are not absolutely wrong, but given to inspire thought. If we make compromise after compromise, when it is all said and done: what do we have left?
----------------

"**Above All**" -- 
	Crucified, laid behind a stone 
	You lived to die, rejected and alone 
	**Like a rose, trampled on the ground 
	You took the fall and thought of me 
	Above all**

"Took the Fall" -- intended meaning: "Took the Blame". But in the context of Scripture, depicting Christ's sacrifice as a "Fall" is not harmonious with Scriptural doctrine of the "Fall of Man" and the victory Christ won at the cross.

Do we prefer the passing and contemporary "slang" over the Word pictures God created in His Word?
----------------

**Draw Me Close**

	You're All I Want 
	You're All I've Ever Needed 
	You're All I Want 
	Help Me Know You Are Near

Sparse on truth. Nothing false said, but not much truth said either. If our worship diet consisted of 7/11 songs, there is bloatedness about being **filled with feeling but lacking the substance of conviction.**

----------------

WARNING: "Third Wave" Christianity.

An undercurrent to most modern music is Third Wave Christianity. 

Wagner (Professor at Fuller Theological Seminary) explained the Third Wave as "a gradual opening of straightline evangelical churches to the supernatural ministry of the Holy Spirit without the participants becoming either Pentecostals or Charismatics.

Provides a Spiritual Experience without the doctrines that govern living the Life of the Spirit. (Sanctification, Purging, Obedience, Yielded, Holiness, Waiting on God and preparing the vessel.) Jumping over the PROCESS of waiting in the Upper Room and all it entails and skipping ahead to the power of spiritual gifts and experiences.

## CONCLUSION

There are many undercurrents and spirits that motivate our actions. It is only through a proper handling of the Word that we safely navigate this wilderness.

> Ps 51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
