#This Time, Keep Your Shoes On
text: Song of Solomon 5:2-4, 6a

##INTRODUCTION - Shoes
- There is no reason to hide. (Clifford the big red dog.)
- Ending the Pattern of Defeat. (We are More than Conquerors)

###A. [Barefeet] Slavery and Servanthood
	- Moses at Burning Bush (Ex. 3:5)

> Exodus 3:5 PUT OFF thy shoes, holy ground

	- God is not blind, He sees as we are.
	- Moses did not have the ability to redeem Israel, but GOD did!
	- Even Though he wanted to (murdered the egyptian)

###B. [Shoes] Power and Authority
- Prodigal Son Put Shoes on His Feet "Luke 15:22".
- 
>Song 7:1 - How beautiful are thy feet with shoes,...

- bro. Williams "My feets don't come off!"


###These Shoes are for a Covering - blood, spirit, will, authority
###Never Quit Worshiping - We get in the flesh instead. POWER in the ANOINTING
###Never Quit Feeding - We become weak.
###Never Quit Watching - We become unaware of the danger.
###Never Quit Traveling

##I. UNREADY - Shulamite Lady (SOS 5:3)

>Song 5:3 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them

###Keep your shoes on - Maintaining a State of Readiness

REMEMBER: It is a battle, a spiritual battle
>Exodus 12:11 eat it, with your shoes on...[passover]

Do not enter that battlefield unprepared.

We have become far TOO COMFORTABLE around carnal devices. [computers, phones, tablets even in church.]

>  2Ti 2:22 -- Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

###My Testimony: Trapped in a rut...(Dad would say you can tell me anything.)

UNREADY TO RUN.

##II. UNWILLING - ALTAR CALL

PRIDE, SELFISHNESS, SELF INDULGENCE

- His voice, his knocking, she put off, but

- Her heart skipped a beat as she saw his hand pass by.
