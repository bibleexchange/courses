# Ministry Trip Report

READ: Psalm 91:1-16 <given during meetings with the Blythes>
Ps 91:1 Â¶ He that dwelleth in the **secret place** of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 

**Thursday**, June 18, 2015 (left)

	TRAVELING: Over 2,000 miles travelled. Safe without incident. With two suitcases strapped to the roof, Benjamin, Jeremiah, Matthew Derocher, Laura, Stephen, Amelia and myself (7) left home Thursday morning and arrived in Joppa, Maryland by the evening (13 hours/500 miles later. an average speek of 38.5 mph :). Travelling was a good time for ministry planning and discussion. Most of us stayed with Laura's parents and Matt stayed with the Parret's in Rising Sun Maryland.
 
	*Two Prayer Requests*:

1. **Rhonda Parrett** - Heart trouble, initially seemed like it might be fatal. Doctors now feel its something they might be able to help. Rhonda is very frail right now. Her life is given to ministering as a christian school administrator/supervisor/monitor/tutor/etc. A nearby church school closed up this spring and at least 8 of its former students will be enrolling at Holiness Christian Academy this fall. RHONDA NEEDS HER STRENGTH.

2. **Johnny Grose** - Bro. Johnny seemed weak when we arrived although he hadn't slowed down any. He was still working 5 days a week as an electrician, pastoring and taking care of his family. He had been struggling in his health, but it wasn't until we were on our way home that we learned how serious his condition is. The day we left, he was admitted in the hospital and underwent surgery the next day on his heart. He is home now, but with stints and a pacemaker in his heart, there are some difficult decisions he will have to make in the coming weeks in order to lesson the strain on his heart. He is a careGIVER at heart and being forced by health reasons to do less will not be easy.

**Friday**

We spent the day enjoying our family and resting. I picked Jessica up at BWI airport. She needed to stay an extra day at home before leaving.

**Sat** 

We loaded up our belongings and travelers in the Dogwood Church's van in Rising Sun and began our 450 mile trip to Abingdon, Virginia. Along with our troop there were 3 young ladies and Pastor Parrett's oldest son Andrew. That was 12 of us (including two car seats) with our belongings in a 12 passenger van. 9 hours later, we arrived in Abingdon, Virginia.

Because of Rhonda's Health and work responsibilities, Andy and Rhonda Parrett traveled down in another vehicle on Tuesday with 3 more young people.

Upon arrival the pastor and wife, Jason and Kristi Nunley, opened there home for us to stay in during the week of camp. By the time camp got going, there were 18 people staying in that 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom house. People sleeping in every room except the kitchen and bathrooms.

**Sunday**

Sunday Morning 21 year old, college student and 1 year preacher, Andrew Parret was scheduled to preach. His passion and sincerity made an impression on me. He seemed to carry a genuine burden for the people while preaching.

An altar call was given and a few songs sung. The pastor stood and I thought it was to close the service, but he asked the folks if they had time for more preaching and then announced that I would be coming. With the tight seating and moving about, I couldn't find my Bible initially, but Benjamin found it for me before we got too far.

As my only 'scheduled' ministry was teaching adults for two days later in the week, I really hadn't thought to prepare a sermon for that service. I was taking the day in as a rest to prepare myself for the coming week. I turned to Isaiah 54:1-5 and the Lord helped me preach about God's Heart for the Backslider. Especially, vs. 5 "For they Maker is thine husband" Isaiah 54:1-5). Though Israel had been Barren, Desolate and now apparently a WIDOW (**hadn't accomplished anything, alone and in no condition to be WANTED --- potential gone**.) God's message to her was: 

1) ALL IS NOT LOST: Enlarge Your Tent "lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;" 

Restore Faith and confidence in God. Look to Him with expectation. Stakes : Restore Conviction in His Promises and Commands.

2) For thy maker is thine husband & Kinsman Redeemer (490 years earlier, the story of Ruth). [You belong to me, I will take care of you.]

--

That evening Jacob Berry preached an evangelistic message on Mark 13:32-37.
vs. 37 And what I say unto you I say unto all, **Watch**. Sharing several dreams he felt the Lord had given him that gave him a sense of urgency for his own soul and the souls of others, he exhorted us to be in READINESS and WATCH.

**Monday** 
	
MORNING: Andrew Parrett. (filled with morning services with young preachers who grew up in the camp.)

	Matt had on the first night, just moved into the boys' dorm, ready to work!

	LATE AFTERNOON: Teaching for PREACHERS, Aaron Sizemore (2 Kings 9:3 "tarry not" finding a close, give God's message and then "get out of town".)

	PM: Jacob Berry "" <didn't take very good notes if any>

**Tuesday**
	
	MORNING: Jacob Stover preached. 

	---
	
	ON THE RIVER BOYS: "The Advantage" -- How to win in the struggle of flesh and sin. 1 Kings 18:24 "...let him be God.." 1) Practice Self Denial (pattern of self worship) 2) stop Breathing Life into what has been crucified 3) Remain Accountable

	AFTERNOON with ADULTS: Genesis 19 & Judges 19 Are our lifestyles and perpetual struggles with the same things creating casualties we can't afford. We may barely make it by the skin of our teeth "**But... are the children safe**?" 1) Covering 2) Restraint 3)An Example

	---
	
	LATE AFTERNOON: Teaching for PREACHERS, Andy Parrett  - Gave various advice, testimonies of the call of God

	---

	PM: SGRJR "Finding Bethel" Genesis 28:10-12,16-19 - God cannot be known in the same you you do schooling, but God is known in experiencing his glory. The mechanics of Christianity aren't thrilling, but in Psalm 122:1 David said he was GLAD to go to the house of the Lord. There is more to Christianity than a form in church.

	If you want to know what the Grand Canyon is like, ask someone he has had the experience of being there. Much of the nonesense and deadness in church is because those we ware watching for clarity, understanding sing, preach, talk but haven't EXPERIENCED the glory of God -- the Holy Ghost moving profoundly upon and in us. 

	Behind the frail veil of "church" and the constructs of our "worship" is the presence of an eternal God. Hid from eyes, but can and will be found of them that diligently seek him. Exodus 33:18 "Shew me thy Glory"
	
**Thursday**
	
	Conversation with Isaiah H. - "Obedience" and "Opportunity". The next morning service I took time to pray for him. He came to me in the evening service on friday night and hugged me and just wept thanking me.

	---

	PM: Dale Wheeler (I thought he was ill, but almost 40 days fasting.) "Remember Your Companions" Daniel 2:10-17 vs. 17 "his companions". Preached to those present that go back home to ungodly, broken and divided homes --- YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Your companions are here for you. Told the story of the redwood trees and their roots.

Bucket of Dirty water ( kids who had done the obstacle course that day rinsed their hands off in it). So much had been done to it and mix in with it that it was undesireable. BUT...RUTH came out of Moab. Bro. Jason carried that bucket around "look inside, what do you see?" "Dirty Water" , "God says, I see a king". <Ruth - Obed - Jesse - David>
