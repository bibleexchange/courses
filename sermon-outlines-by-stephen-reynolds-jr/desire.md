Overcome with Desire - (James 1:13-15; Psalm 27:4)
Jas 1:13 ¶ Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:  14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

Ps 27:4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.

#INTRODUCTION

desire n. a strong feeling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen.

- appetite, hunger, want, need, longing, taste for, love, lust, covet, crave

##Eve 
> Genesis 3:6&mdash; And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was **pleasant** to the eyes, and a tree **to be desired** to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 

- pleasant = a desire (Psalm 10:17; Pr. 13:12; Isa 26:8)
- to be desired (Exodus 20:17; Deut. 7:25; Pr. 1:22; SOS 2:3)

##Achan
> Joshua 7:20-21 I coveted them (Achan)

##David
> 2 Sa 23:15 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem

##Solomon
>  1Ki 5:10 ¶ So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.

##Nehemiah
> Ne 1:11 O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.

We often DESIRE what is harmful to us. It doesn't have to make sense, to be a very REAL feeling--I WANT IT! Desire turns to ADDICTION and satisfaction is fleeting. (Overcome with Desire)

Pr 1:22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.

AM I BROKEN? Well, yes, but there is cure!!! Fix it for me preacher.

##Where Does Desire Come From?

**Desire is a symptom of the heart condition.** As a desire for water is a sympton of a thirsty body, so desires of a moral nature are symptons of the condition of the heart. 

Our desires are revealing of the condition of our heart. Cravings are symptons of deficiencies and conditions. How deep does the Lord's influence run in my life? 

My heart is conditioned to desire, to long, to want. 

The devil can wave it in front of me, but if I don't WANT it, he is wasting his time!

What am I allowing to CONDITION me to desire? (Advertising, Messaging, "ILLUST. of logo design and messaging")

> Genesis 13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and **pitched his tent toward Sodom**.

God made us with our senses and desires. Sin perverts them and the influence of Christ redeems and restores them.

>  Ps 139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

-------------------------
If you could just take that tenacity you use to serve the devil and turn it toward serving God, you would be unstoppable.

##How to Defeat an Evil Desire?

> Pr 23:6 ¶ Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:

If Desire is a sympton, don't band-aid, hide, cover up the sympton. It's a red flag something is wrong of great impact. **Seek Deliverance -- Go After It!!!**

###Desires snowball -- 

John 4:13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into

###Instead of your heart, let God's Word GUIDE us:

> 2 Timothy 2:22 ¶ Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

###Nail it to the cross. Confront your heart with the sacrifice of Christ's innocence.

###Every craving begins with a cue. (a trigger, a smell, a sight, a sensation, a memory) 
- Limit satan's access to your heart. 
- Limit your flesh's access to its lusts (get out of town, cut it off)

##Pure Desires

The best defense is a good offense. Substitute negative desires with that which is wholesome. Find the ALTERNATIVE.

###DESIRING what is right, begins with DENYING yourself.

 Mt 16:24 ¶ Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

###The School of Christ
 Php 4:11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

###Put God's Provision to Work in Your Life!
Ps 34:8 **O taste and see** that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.

Ps 10:17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: **thou wilt prepare their heart**, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
