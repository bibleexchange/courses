#Antichrist
The word Antichrist means the great adversary of Christ. The enemy of God.

This Antichrist is already in the world, (I John 4:3; 2:18; 2:22). In I John 2:18 says Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.

This Antichrist will come from the old world, he will the new Roman empire and will have dominion over the world. (Rev 13:1) He will have great powers. He will persecute and try to destroy all Christianity. Also he will establish a world wide religion because man must have some kind of religion. This religion will be called State-worship. The first attempt to establish State-worship is recorded in Daniel when Nebuchadnezzar was king and built the great Babylonian empire.

He set up a golden image and commanded all the people to worship this or they would die. He tried to convince the people that this state gave them everything.

The French Revolution is another example of this policy. God and Christ were cast out and the goddess, "La Patrie". or the State. The citizen is born, lives, and dies to "La Patrie".

Jesus tells the leaders that were trying to catch him in doing wrong, God is to receive the things that are God's, and Caesar is to receive the things that are Caesar's. Caesar demanded the things that were God's and was lost.
