#Wedding Customs of the Jews in Relation to Christ
Revelation 19:7-9
Rev. James R. Reynolds, Sr.

##The Bridegroom Makes the Choice

In studying the betrothal and wedding customs, I have found tradition required that the groom make the arrangements and choice. It is He Who chose us and not the other way around. 

When the groom visited the house of the one he had chosen to be his bride, he was to bring three things with him: 1) a large sum of money to pay the price of the bride 2) a marriage contract or covenant and 3) a skin of wine.

##A Large Sum of Money was Paid for the Bride
Jesus paid a large sum with His blood!

>1 Corinthians 6:20&mdash;For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.

<!---->

>1 Peter 1:18-19&mdash;Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; 19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:

##A Marriage Contract was Made.

The marriage contract Christ brought is the New Testament which is the New Covenant which superseded the old.

>Matthew 26:28&mdash;For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.

##A Skin of Wine was Brought.

> John 7:37,38&mdash;In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.

##The Contract would be Laid Out and Discussed.

The Gospel message has been laid out and discussed for over 2000 years.

##The Daughter Signified her Approval by Drinking the Wine.

On the Day of Pentecost they drank the wine that He sent.

Acts 2:15-18&mdash;Ac 2:15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. 16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: 18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:

##At this Point the Groom and Bride were officially betrothed.

This union, though not a marriage yet, could only be dissolved by a decree of divorce. If the bride was found to be unfaithful in anyway, she was put away.

Jesus said of the church in Revelation 3:16, "I will spue you out of My mouth".

##The Bridegroom would Depart and Begin Preparation of the Wedding Chamber.

> John 14:2&mdash;In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

##The Bride would Spend a Year in Preparation.

She would go through cleansing and purification rituals. Remember Esther?

>Esther 2:12&mdash;Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)

>Psalm 45:9&mdash;Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

##The Bridegroom would Select Two to be Witnesses

One witness would make sure the Bride would be accompanied to the wedding and the other would remain with the bridegroom.

The Holy Ghost has come to prepare and escort the Bride to the Groom, as Abraham sent his servant (Genesis 24:4). Sometimes it in Jews custom it was even the father who would go the Bride. Samson sent his father to make his arrangements (Judges 14:3). 

##The Marriage Contract Presented

At the wedding ceremony the bridegroom would present a second contract that contained the promises the groom pledged to the Bride.

##The Wedding Chamber

After the Ceremony the Bride and Bridegroom would stay for a period of time in the wedding chamber.

##The Marriage Supper

When the Bridegroom and the Bride come out of the wedding chamber, the wedding feast would begin. The celebration and feast were for invited guests only. Anyone not invited would be cast out of the party.
