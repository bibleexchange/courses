Eye hath not seen and ear hath not heard but he hath reveled them unto us by the Spirit (I Corinthians 2:9, 10). Many times we read over things, and have read it over and over but than all to once the Lord reveals something unto you and it is like a new window that is opened unto you. </span></p><p class="csEF956D1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">Judah always in scripture has to do with praise.

It is not that old time religion anymore. </span></p><p class="csEF956D1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">The Holy Spirit knows more than you will ever be able to learn. He can do for you in a sec what would take you years and years to learn, actually things you would never learn. </span></p><p class="csEF956D1"><span class="csCF6BBF71">His words are spirit and life.
