#Song of Solomon Lesson 1

– Introduction –

#The song of songs, which is Solomon's

Song of Solomon 1:1

Before you begin to study this book, and or listen to these messages and or study these notes read the book in it’s entirety at least three times, in order to gain a surface understanding of this wonderful book called the Song of Solomon.

Many Christians live their entire lives without reading Song of Solomon. They know it is in the Bible, but they appear to be ashamed of its presence. It is a beautiful book and nothing to be ashamed of rightly interpreted and rightly understood.

Song of Solomon 1:1-7
The song of songs, which is Solomon's.
 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.
Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.
 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

Some Bible scholars, Bible interpreters, along with some commentators believe that this book does not belong in the Canon of the Bible, and 
many do not believe that the Song of Solomon is an inspired book. All they see is a demonstration of a love affair, an earthly feeling between a lover and her friend.

PLEASE NOTE: This is not an account of earthly feelings or expressions, but a relationship that is Heavenly and Holy and not as a story of the natural.
Prepare yourself for some expressions that are found in this book. Again these expressions are not of the carnal nature or of “Earthly Expressions,”
but in the Holy of Holies, beyond the Outer Court, beyond the Inner Court beyond the Holy place, beyond the Veil in the Most Holy Place,  here Christ is manifesting His divine affection for you not as an earthly thing but Holy and Heavenly. 
Don’t allow the Devil to honeycomb your understanding of the bible.
Do you fully understand how much God wants and desires you?


> Eph 1:3  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: 

**Spiritual Blessings in High Places.**

If you truly love someone, the most important thing that you can do is spend time with them.

We must be making every effort to spend time with the Lord.

God makes many advances toward the one He loves in this book.

(Stay close to Jesus in the Spirit and He will help you keep your garment clean)

**The Lord wants to express Himself to you!**

He wants to Love you like you have never been loved before!

He desires to share divine secrets in the Spirit with those He 
truly Loves!


> Joh 15:15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you

The Lord Jesus Christ wants us as His people to Love Him with out any reservation at all for ourselves.

With All Our Heart

With All Our Soul

With All Our Mind

With All Our Strength

 Matt. 22:37 Mk, 12:30, Lk. 10:27, Deut. 6:5, 10:12, 13:3, 30:6   


**We are to be in fellowship with Him and one with another but never with worldiness.**
> Ac 2:42 ¶ And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
> 
>  1Co 1:9 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
>  
> 1Jo 1:3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
> 
> 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.
> 
> 2Co 8:4 Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
> 
> Eph 3:9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
> 

The Lord really Loves you.
You are Spiritually desired

God truly loves us more than we can comprehend.

> 1Jo 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
> 
> 1Jn 4:9  In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 
> 
> 1Jn 4:10  Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 

**God does not want the world to play around with you, nor you to play around with the world.**

> Ex 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
> 
>  Ex 34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
>  
>  De 4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.
>  
>  De 5:9 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,
>  
>  De 6:15 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
>  
> Na 1:2 ¶ God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.
> 
> Song 8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.

You must know that the Lord loves you if you are going to understand this book.

**No one will Love you any more than Jesus Does**

There are three general lines of thought here in the Book.

## **The Relationship of Jehovah with Israel {Gods chosen people}** ##

### The revealing of God’s choice and guidance of the Nation of Israel out of Egypt. ###

###  God’s direction and divine providence over Israel during their journey through the wilderness

###  They were placed in the Land of Canaan  waiting for their Messiah to come.**

As an overall view there is a likeness here. Israel is a type where you can 
find God dealing with His people

> Ro 15:4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
> 
> 1Cor 10:11  Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 
> 
> Heb 8:5  Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as       Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. 


##  The relationship of Christ with His Church

This is a popular feeling among many but there are too many discrepancies 
to make the Church the Bride.

##  The relationship of Christ with His Bride

**The Bride is the fragment** (Like the rib taken out of Adam’s side) **so 
the Bride will be taken out of the Great body of the Church**.

> Gen. 2:22  And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he 
>             a woman, and brought her unto the man. 
>             
> Act 15:14  Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, 
>      to take out of them a people for his name.
>       
> Ge 5:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
> 
> Luke 12 
>  35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;
>  36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.
>  37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.
>  38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.
>  
> 1 Thessalonians 3 
>  13 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
>   
> Matthew 25:1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
>  
> Matthew 25 
>  6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
>  
>  Matthew 25 
>  10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: (marriage feast) and the door was shut.
>  
>  Revelation 19 
>  9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.
