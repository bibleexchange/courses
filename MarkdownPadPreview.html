<p>@[verse](Philippians 4:1)</p>
<h1>Background to the Epistle to the Philippians</h1>
<h2>The Purpose</h2>
<p>The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus (Phil 2:25), with a gift as an expression of their concern to meet the needs of Paul (Phil 1:3–5, Phil 2:30, and Phil 4:10–19).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philippians 4:15-17 &mdash; Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometime during his journey to deliver the gift to Paul, Epaphroditus contracted some life-threatening debilitating illness. At some point he recovers. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philippians 2:26,27 &mdash; For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. 27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is at this time, Epaphroditus shares some news of the church at Philippi: </p>
<ul>
<li>The presence of spiritual conflicts in the church. (Phil 1:27–30)</li>
<li>The church's immediate need for Paul's visit. (Phil 2:19–24)</li>
<li>The presence of false doctrine slipping into the church. (Phil 3:2–3)</li>
<li>The presence of those who usurp positions to lead away from Christ. (Phil 3:17–20)</li>
<li>The current state of leadership and who is still present since Paul's visit 10 years prior. (Phil 4:2–3)</li>
<li>The presence of evidence of the temptation to waver in what they had been taught and shown. (Phil 4:9)</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon Epaphroditus' return to health, Paul sends word to the Philippians through Epaphroditus of his upcoming sentence in Rome and of his optimism in the face of death (1:18b–26), along with exhortations to imitate his capacity to rejoice in the Lord despite one's circumstances (2:14–18). </p>
<p>In summary, Paul's purpose of writing this epistle was to <strong>Thank</strong> them for their Gift and Concern (4:10,18), <strong>Warn of False Teachers</strong> (3:1-3), <strong>Warn of the Dangers of Contentious Quarreling</strong> (1:28; 2:3), <strong>Encourage</strong>  (The word joy or rejoice is found in every chapter. 1:4,18,25-26; 2:2,16,18; 3:1,3; 4:1,4,10; Sin is not mentioned once; Paul intends to visit: 1:25, 26; 2:24).</p>
<h2>The Church At Philippi</h2>
<p>Paul and Silas first visited Philippi in Greece during Paul's second missionary journey, which occurred between approximately 49 and 51 AD. Philippi was the location of the first Christian community established in Europe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts 16:11-15 &mdash; Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; 12 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. 13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither. 14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. 15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Philippi consisted mostly of retired Roman Soldiers and their Families. Anyone born there was given automatic Roman citizenship. It was clearly a place where Roman citizenship and its benefits were understood and valued.</li>
<li>The riverside prayer meeting indicates a small Jewish population as there is evidently not enough Jews to build a synagogue (Jewish law required at least 10 Jewish men in a place in order to have a synagogue.) Paul's usual custom to preach to the &quot;Jews first&quot; was interrupted as there was no synagogue in Philippi.</li>
<li>The Leadership of the Ladies at Phillippi is significant: Lydia hosts the church in her home (Acts 16:15), and Paul credits Euodias and Syntyche as having &quot;laboured with me in the gospel&quote;.</li>
<li>It was at Phillipi, Paul and Silas prayed for deliverance of a fortune telling slave girl. It was this deliverance that attracted the hatred of those who enslaved the girl and brought Paul and Silas to prison. (Acts 16:16-40)</li>
<li>Paul and Silas' imprisonment, resulted in the jailer's and his family's salvation.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts 16:30 &mdash; And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Paul leaves a testimony of courage and faithfulness to God despite injustice and even illegal treatment.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Acts 16:37 &mdash; But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Philippians Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>Introduction to All the Saints, vs. 1,2</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Philippians 1:1,2 &mdash; 1 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 2 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Writers &quot;Paul and Timothy&quot;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Philippians 1:1 &mdash; Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul with Timothy's help and the Holy Spirit's inspiration wrote the letter of Philippians. Paul possibly wrote this epistle about 10 years after his first visit to Philippi. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew Henry &mdash; &quot;...he [PAUL] joins Timothy with himself, to express his own humility, and put honour upon Timothy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phillippians is written probably during Paul's 2 year House Arrest in Rome (Acts 29:14-31). Philippians 1:3,4 Paul mentions his bonds. He was under arrest as he had made his appeal to Ceasar and was waiting an audience. This was not in a dugeon, but he was under house arrest with 1 guard and was allowed visitors and was free to share the Gospel with them. Paul made his appeal to Ceasar not for his personal defence but so that &quot;the Gentiles will hear the gospel.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Acts 16 - 2nd Missionary Journey with Silas: First Visit</li>
<li>Acts 20 - 3rd Missionary Journey: Second Visit</li>
<li>(No in Scripture) Possible 4th Missionary Journey (After Epistle written): Third Visit</li>
<li>(Acts ends with Paul waiting in Rome) Followed by Second Imprisonment in Rome and Martyrdom</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul is Hopeful and intends to visit: &quot;I shall come shortly&quot; (2:24). It is probable he died in Rome and didn't make it for a 3rd visit to Philippi, but Paul does recommend and send Timothy to them.</p>
<h3>&quot;ALL&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;ALL&quot; the saints points back to Paul's purpose of encouraging the Church. </li>
</ul>
<p>He makes it clear that the letter he is writing is intended for &quot;All the saints.&quot; He is inferring that for the Christian church the only qualification that really matters is to be &quot;saints in Christ Jesus.&quot; It is also interesting that he mentions &quot;ALL&quot; before he does &quot;BISHOPS and DEACONS&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galatians 3:28 &mdash; There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Gospel is for All.</li>
</ul>
<p>John M. Mcaleb: </p>
<p>Of one the Lord has made the race, Thro’ one has come the fall;
Where sin has gone must go His grace; The Gospel is for all.</p>
<p>Say not the heathen are at home, Beyond we have no call,
For why should we be blest alone? The Gospel is for all.</p>
<p>Received ye freely, freely give, From every land they call;
Unless they hear, they cannot live: The Gospel is for all.</p>
<p>Refrain</p>
<p>The blessèd Gospel is for all, The Gospel is for all;
Where sin has gone must go His grace: The Gospel is for all.</p>
<h3>&quot;SAINTS&quot;</h3>
<p>How many saints are there in church history? </p>
<p>The saints are not a canonized list of names of dead people canonized by the Roman Catholic church, but a saint Biblically is any believer who is &quot;in Christ&quot; and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. Saints are those who have dedicated themselves to the worship and service of the one true God as revealed through his Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holiness in character: religious, sacred, consecrated</li>
<li>Morally blameless</li>
<li>Physically and spiritually pure</li>
<li>One set apart for Holy fellowship and service. &quot;sanctified&quot;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Col 1:12 ¶ Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</p>
<p>Titus 2:12 &mdash; Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&quot;Grace be unto you and peace&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>GRACE: God's unmerited favor. Providence.</li>
<li>PEACE: Phil. 4:7; God's gift of peace is beyond human understanding</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prayer for the Saints, vs. 3-11</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: 7 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. 8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment; 10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ. 11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 6:18; 1 Timothy 2:1; Colossians 1:19; Romans 15:30; 1 Thessalonians 5:25</p>
<blockquote>
<p>D. L Moody used to tell the story of a man who came to him and said, “When the Mexican war began I wanted to enlist. My mother, seeing I was resolved, said if I became a Christian I might go. She pleaded and prayed that I might become a Christian, but I wouldn’t. I said when the war was over I would become a Christian, but not till then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“All her pleading was in vain, and at last, when I was going away, she took out a watch and said: My son, your father left this to me when he died. Take it, and I want you to remember that every day at 12 o’clock your mother will be praying for you. Then she gave me her Bible, and marked out passages, and put a few different references in the fly-leaf. I took the watch and the Bible just because my mother gave them. I never intended to read the Bible.</p>
<p>“I went off to Mexico, and one day while on a long, weary march, I took out my watch, and it was 12 o’clock. I had been gone four months, but I remembered that my mother at that hour was praying for me. Something prompted me to ask the officer to relieve me for a little while, and I stepped behind a tree away out on those plains of Mexico, and cried to the God of my mother to save me.”</p>
<p>God saved him, and after the Mexican war was ended, he said, “I have enlisted again to see if I can do any good for my Master’s cause.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story is told about two wives who were doing their laundry in a laundry mat. They were both mending their husband’s pants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One wife said, “My husband is so miserable. Nothing goes right at work, and he can’t find anything good on television. Our home is a place of despair. When we go to church, the song leader is terrible and the pastor is an idiot.</p>
<p>The other wife said “My husband is so excited.” He can’t wait to go to church. He loves the sermons. We laugh all the time and enjoy our family.</p>
<p>It got very quiet in the laundry room as the women continued sewing the pants. One was patching the seat of the pants, and the other was patching the knees.`</p>
<h3>1. The Motivation of His Prayer</h3>
<p>Prayer motivated by love</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thankful</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Thankful for You Upon Every Remembrance of You</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Desirous of Fellowship in the Gospel</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In Every Prayer of Mine, <strong>making request with joy</strong> for your <strong>fellowship in the Gospel</strong> (from the first day until now)</p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 5:11 -- Build Each Other Up</p>
<p>Knowledge is increased by fellowship, love and truth. 1:7 &quot;Partakers of my grace&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luke 19:15 &quot;gained by trading&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confident and Expecting</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p>Spiritual Prayer: Romans 8:26; 2 Corinthians 10:4
Confident: Proverbs 15:29; Hebrews 4:16</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common Trial: Common Blessing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, <strong>ye all are partakers of my grace</strong>. </p>
<p>Having witnessed and benefited from their Christian Fruit, it is just and evident ye are &quot;partakers of my grace&quot; -- you are truly saved. To partake of this grace is to communicate the same you receive to others.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you in my heart&quot; -- Paul is warmly attached to them.</p>
<p>As they had fellowshipped and shared with Paul in his BONDS and in the WORK of the Gospel, they also will share in same favor of God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 2:12 &mdash; If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us: 
Romans 8:17 &mdash; And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
1 Peter 4:13 &mdash; But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Longing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. </p>
<h3>2. The Requests of His Prayer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>I pray your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Perfection of love is produced by the increase of the knowledge of the Son of God, &quot;yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment&quot; Phil. 3:10 &quot;That I may know Him&quot;</p>
<p>Shows our perception advancing.</p>
<p>Knowledge produces love but love produces greater knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I pray ye may approve things that are excellent</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Perfection of love produces the ability to discern.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I pray that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The perfection of love produces purity.</p>
<p>&quot;Sincere&quot; &mdash; judged by sunlight. Tested as genuine, Pure, &quot;Without offence&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I pray you are filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The perfection of love produces a fruitful life. 1:11 &quot;Being filled With the fruits of righteousness&quot;The nature of man must be changed by grace before he can bear fruit. &quot;Which are by Christ Jesus Unto the Glory and Praise of God&quot; Fruit is the Indication of the general character.</p>
<h3>Purpose in the Trial: Furtherance of the Gospel, vs. 12-30</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is God's will that the Gospel be preaching everywhere to everyone.</li>
<li>God uses ordinary people (young, old, male, female, gifted, simple) to spread the Gospel.</li>
<li>Whose cause do we further by our manner of living?</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Gospel Furthered In the Midst of Persecution and False Pretenses, vs. 12-18</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; 13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places; 14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 16 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: 17 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. 18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>&quot;I would ye should understand&quot;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Paul rights here desiring that the Believer's would not be offended. Paul's imprisonment might be a stumbling-block to those who had received the gospel by his ministry. They might be tempted to think, If this doctrine were indeed of God, God would not allow such treatment of Paul.</p>
<p>They responded to Christ's affliction with the same criticism: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 27:41-43 &mdash; Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, 42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. 43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They might be timid of owning this doctrine, lest they find their own trouble through association.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Things Which Have Happened Unto Me</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 3:10-12 &mdash; 10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me. 12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>

<h2>Introduction: Motivated by Love, vs. 1</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Church at Philippi was dear to Paul and He to them. (phil. 4:1 &quot;my joy and crown&quot;)</li>
<li>They followed news of Him through his journeys, until they lost word of him when he was arrested.</li>
<li>They sent Epaphroditus to find Paul and bring him an offering and encourage Paul in their love and support.</li>
<li>In Philippians, Paul Writes of CHRISTIAN LIVING: 1) Philosophy 2) Pattern 3) Prize 4) Power of/for Christian Living</li>
</ul>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<ul>
<li>If You have Benefited from Following Christ: consolation, love, fellowship, mercy, etc. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Phil. 2:1 ¶ If there be therefore any consolation/encouragement in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Christ&apos;s lowliness and humility</li>
</ul>
<p>**IF ... ** Paul's choice of approach here for motivating the church in Philipi is THE REALITY AND BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL. </p>
<ul>
<li>What am I being motivated by?</li>
<li>Many are moved entirely by what their flesh wants, what is familiar or comfortable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Has the God we serve been GOOD to us? Has it been <strong>DIFFERENT</strong> since Jesus saved your soul?</p>
<ul>
<li>
Then BE THIS KIND OF PEOPLE ... Taking inventory of the blessings of God in our life should move us:
<ul>
<li>Speak what We have Heard from God</li>
<li>Love as We have been Loved</li>
<li>Encourage as We have been Encouraged.</li>
<li>Be Merciful as We have Received Mercy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not to be mere RESERVOIRS, but CONDUITS of God's consolation/encouragement, comfort, love, fellowship, mercy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mt 10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: <strong>freely ye have received, freely give</strong>.</p>

<p>5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

<p>17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. 18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. 19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 20 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. 21 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. 22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. 23 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. 24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. 25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants. 26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. 27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 28 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: 30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</p>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Albert Barnes &quot;Dogs in the east are mostly without masters; they wander at large in the streets and fields, and feed upon offals, and even upon corpses.&quot; (1 Samuel 17:43; 2 Kings 8:13)</li>

<li>Like a Sign posted in front of home &quot;Beware of Dog&quot;.</li>
<li>False Doctrine, Legalism, Judaizers, Evil Workers, Circumcision</li>
</ul>
<h2>Spiritual Circumcision, vs. 3-6</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Philippians 4:3-6 &mdash; For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. 4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: 5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; 6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Spiritual Circumcision (Acts 15)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Circumcision never applied to Christians (Acts 15:5-11)</strong>. The Apostle Peter, who was circumcised, said: (Acts 15:11)</p>
<p>No. Christians were freed from the Law, including circumcision (Acts 15:1-20). It was described as an almost unbearable yoke on the neck (Acts 15: 10). The yoke, of course, was a sign of slavery and Christians were told not to become entangled with 'a yoke of bondage' (Galatians 5:1-2).</p>
<p>What did the early church decide about circumcision?
Some were saying that Christians must follow the Law of Moses and be circumcised. Peter replied (Acts 15:10, New RSV)</p>
<p>The early church followed Peter, and all were welcome, circumcised or not. The early church rejected the ideas that Christians had to be circumcised and follow the Law of Moses.</p>
<p><strong>What did Paul teach about circumcision?</strong></p>
<p>Genesis 17:14 says that an uncircumcised man shall be 'cut off from his people' but Paul taught that those who accept circumcision are obliged to keep the whole law, and those who want to be justified by the law have cut themselves off from Christ (Galatians 5: 2-4).</p>
<p>Paul confirmed that circumcision was nothing (Galatians 6:15) and Christ was all and in all (Colossians 3:11). Jeremiah had already taught that circumcision in other nations was uncircumcision (Jeremiah 9: 25-26).</p>
<p>Paul advised people to accept their lot in life and not seek circumcision or uncircumcision, or slavery or freedom (1 Corinthians 7:17-24).</p>
<p>Paul condemned people he described as false believers (Galatians 2:4). These people were pressuring Christians to become circumcised. (Galatians 5: 12)</p>
<p>Paul taught that Jesus accepts people as they are and does not ask them to become circumcised or uncircumcised to become Christian (Galatians 5: 6). Paul said, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved...' (Acts 16: 31).</p>
<h2>Paul's Prize, vs. 7-14</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. 8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, 9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith: 10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; 11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. 12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. 13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, 14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>He is an omnipresent help when called. Psalm 46:5 <strong>HE will judge US and OTHERS</strong>. This is no time to be caught sitting in the seat of the scornful.</p>
<h3>Do Not Be Anxious, vs.6,7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</p>

<h4>1.Anxiety and the Believer</h4>
<ul>
<li>What does the Philippian church have to be anxious about?</li>
<li>Worry, fear, anxiety, distressing, handicapping, causing dysfunction</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>LEIGH ANN MARSHALL in her article &quot;Depression, anxiety, and the church: A pastor’s wife tells her story of hope&quot; wrote: &quot;Since the garden, our world has been thoroughly and profoundly broken from the introduction of sin. This brokenness affects every part of our lives, from who we are, how we act, how we work, and how we relate to one another, to natural disasters and physical illness. As evangelicals, we are quick to see this universal bodily brokenness in cancer and heart disease, but when we approach mental illness, often our first response is to assume a lack of faith or inward transformation of the gospel. Why is this? ... More than 18 percent of Americans struggle with depression and anxiety, but the STIGMA and shame still holds strong in the church and even stronger for those who hold roles in ministry.&quot;</p>
<p>Ashley Layne in her article &quot;The Unspoken Anxiety in the Church.&quot; &quot;Often times with good intentions, mature Christians may sometimes give this verse [Philippians 4:6]to individuals suffering with anxiety. ... because anxiety is not tangible we may not believe that it actually exists or we simply don’t know the best strategy to combat it. But, to the individual experiencing it, it is real and it is difficult to get through. In this case, though intentions are pure, simply quoting a bible verse may not always be the best way to approach the situation when someone confides in you with their mental health struggle.&quot;</p>
<p>Anxiety disorders go beyond everyday stress and may sometimes involve feelings of excessive fear or worry. With anxiety, the body reacts as if danger is present when there is no actual threat. The body sounds all the alarms to the sympathetic nervous system to prepare for fight or flight, when in truth no harm is present. Approximately 44 million adults in the United States suffer from anxiety disorders and less than a 1/3 of those seek some kind of help. People do not seek out help because they feel ASHAMED or EMBARASSED.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>2. &quot;Careful for Nothing&quot;</h4>
<pre><code>- **Daniel 3:16** &quot;We are not careful&quot; [we care not; decisive; not deliberating; minds made up, having no need to consider any further.]
- **Matthew 6:25-33** &quot;Take no thought for your life,&quot; [be not anxiously careful; Adam Clarke :&quot;Prudent care is never forbidden by our Lord, but only that anxious distracting solicitude, which, by dividing the mind, and drawing it different ways...&quot;; Do not LOSE the comfort in the things which God gives.]
- **Matthew 10:19** &quot;take no thought how or what ye shall speak&quot; [Do not become anxious; God will inpsire you and you should be inspired! ]
</code></pre>

<h4>3. How Do we Read and Do Philippians 4:6?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There being both anxiety that stems from a real circumstance particular to our mind as well as anxiety caused by something not as real but its effects being no less real, How do we avoid a reading of &quot;condemnation&quot; and &quot;consternation&quot; &quot;Just be happy&quot;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of merely a command you are disobeying, Read as: &quot;Take Comfort. Be Encouraged in... Be Hopeful and Expecting in... Consider the many reasons to trust in God. Look at the promise, not on the problem.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 3 Hebrew Children rested in the Sovereignty of God. (Isaiah 43:2) (Testifying on the street for the first time.) Also, they do not unnecessarily deliberate or delay. MOVE with God!</p>
</li>
<li>In Matthew 6, Jesus tells us to be MINDFUL of God's care and not to LINGER on what we cannot control. &quot;Let not your heart be troubled, John 14:1&quot;</li>
<li>
<p>In Matthew 10, Even when we have &quot;good cause&quot; to be nervous, Trust God above our own abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A great key to &quot;not being anxious&quot; is in bringing your needs to God. There is great comfort in placing your care in God's hands. &quot;by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Peter 5:7 &mdash; Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</p>
<p>BUT GOD by Annie Johnson Flint</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know not, but God knows; Oh, blessed rest from fear! 
All my unfolding days To Him are plain and clear.</p>
<p>Each anxious, puzzled &quot;Why?&quot; From doubt or dread that grows, 
Finds answer in this thought; I know not, but He knows.</p>
<p>I cannot, but God can; Oh, balm for all my care! 
The burden that I drop His hand will lift and bear,</p>
<p>Though eagle pinions tire -- I walk where once I ran -- 
This is my strength, to know I cannot, but God can.</p>
<p>I see not, but God sees; Oh, all-sufficient light! 
My dark and hidden way To Him is always bright.</p>
<p>My strained and peering eyes May close in restful ease, 
And I in peace may sleep; I see not, but He sees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of rebuke, consider bringing HEALING to Each Other. &quot;Bear Up, Comfort on another, Encourage one another&quot; 1 Thessalonians 5:11; Hebrews 10:24,25 [Lazarus didn't believe himself out of the grave; Moses didn't preserve himself in the bulrushes; Jacob didn't fast for a vision at Bethel.]</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. By Prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prayer [GENERAL] - Solemn request to God.</li>
<li>Supplication [SPECIAL] - A stronger term than the former. It is the mode of prayer peculiarly which arises from the sense of need, or want. &quot;to avert evils and ills.&quot; [So Jacob, when fearing Esau (Ge 32:9-12);]</li>
<li>David began very often with tears, but ended with thanksgiving.</li>
<li>In Psalm 34, we learn that David was captured and was taken to King Abimelech, an enemy of Israel.The Lord delivered him that day. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;&lt;A Psalm of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Psalm 34:18,19 &mdash;  18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. 19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Prayer </li>
</ol>
<p>We come to God in prayer for a variety of reasons:
- to worship Him
- to confess our sins and ask for forgiveness
- to thank Him for His blessings
- to ask for things for ourselves, and/or to pray for the needs of others. </p>
<p>In Prayer, generally speaking, there may be no request made, but only praises to God. </p>
<ol>
<li>Supplication</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hebrew and Greek words most often translated “supplication” in the Bible mean literally “a request or petition,” so a prayer of supplication is asking God for something. Unlike the prayer of petition, which is praying on behalf of others, the prayer of supplication is generally a request for the person praying. (&quot;this poor man cried&quot;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalm 34:6 &mdash; This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a. <strong>DAVID</strong></p>
<p>There is always a request in supplication. David’s psalms are filled with supplication for:
-  mercy in Psalm 4:1
-  leading in Psalm 5:8
-  deliverance in Psalm 6:4
-  salvation from persecution in Psalm 7:1</p>
<p>b.  <strong>DANIEL</strong></p>
<p>When Daniel learned that King Darius had issued an edict prohibiting prayer to any god but the king, Daniel continued to pray to God with prayers of thanksgiving as well as prayers of supplication for His help in this dire situation.</p>
<p>c. <strong>BELIEVERS EXHORTED</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus tells us to ask for our daily bread in Matthew 6:11</li>
<li>In Luke 18:1-8, Jesus teaches us not to give up praying for what we need. </li>
<li>James 4:2 says that On one hand, we don't receive because we don't ask (James 4:2). On the other hand, we ask and don't receive because we are thinking only of our fleshly desires (James 4:3). </li>
<li>Supplication should be made as children talking to their kind-hearted Father, but in full surrender to His will (Matthew 26:39).</li>
<li>After describing the need to take up the “full armor of God” (Ephesians 6:13-17), the apostle Paul exhorted the Ephesians to remain alert and to pray in the Spirit, “making supplication for all saints” (Ephesians 6:18). </li>
<li>Paul further exhorts the Philippian church to relieve their anxieties by remaining faithful in prayer, especially prayers of thanksgiving and supplication. This, he concludes, is the formula for ensuring that “the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6-7).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Think on These Things, v.8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not just &quot;think&quot; on these things, but action begins with the thought.</li>
<li>
<p>Peace</p>
<ul>
<li>A) A Gift passes understanding, peace of Christ, peace of God, peace with God</li>
<li>B) Cultivated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, brethren - </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The object of the apostle is to recommend holiness and righteousness to them in every point of view; and to show that the Gospel of Christ requires all its professors to have the mind that was in Christ, and to walk as he himself also walked. That they were not to attend to one branch of righteousness or virtue only, but to every thing by which they might bring honor to God, good to their fellow creatures, and credit to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, brethren</strong> - As for what remains- or as a final counsel or exhortation.</p>
<p>a. <strong>Whatsoever things are true</strong></p>
<!-- copy paste
In this exhortation the apostle assumes that there were certain things admitted to be true, and pure, and good, in the world, which had not been directly revealed, or which were commonly regarded as such by the people of the world, and his object is to show them that such things ought to be exhibited by the Christian. Everything that was honest and just toward God and toward people was to be practiced by them, and they were in all things to be examples of the highest kind of morality. A man who is false to his engagements, or false in his statements and promises, is one who will always disgrace religion.

Whatsoever things are true - Ὁσα - αληθη· All that is agreeable to unchangeable and eternal truth. Whether that which is to be learned from the nature and state of created things, or that which comes immediately from God by revelation.
-->
<p>b. <strong>Whatsoever things are honest</strong></p>
<!-- copy paste
Properly, "venerable, reverend; then honorable, reputable". The word was originally used in relation to the gods, and to the things that pertained to them, as being worthy of honor or veneration. As applied to people, it commonly means grave, dignified, worthy of veneration or regard. In the New Testament it is rendered “grave” in 1 Timothy 3:8, 1 Timothy 3:11, and Titus 2:2, the only places where the word occurs except this; and the noun ( σεμνότης semnotēs) is rendered “honesty” in 1 Timothy 2:2, and “gravity” in 1 Timothy 3:4, and Titus 2:7. It includes indeed what is right in the transaction of business, but it embraces also much more, and means that the Christian is to show respect to all the venerable and proper customs of society, when they did not violate conscience or interfere with the law of God; compare 1 Timothy 3:7.

Whatsoever things are honest - Ὁσα σεμνα· Whatever is grave, decent, and venerable. Whatever becomes you as men, as citizens, and as Christians.
-->
<p>c. <strong>Whatsoever things are just</strong></p>
<!-- copy paste
The things which are right between man and man. A Christian should be just in all his dealings. His religion does not exempt him from the strict laws which bind people to the exercise of this virtue, and there is no way by which a professor of religion can do more injury perhaps than by injustice and dishonesty in his dealings. It is to be remembered that the people of the world, in estimating a person‘s character, affix much more importance to the virtues of justice and honesty than they do to regularity in observing the ordinances of religion; and therefore if a Christian would make an impression on his fellow-men favorable to religion, it is indispensable that he manifest uncorrupted integrity in his dealings.

Whatsoever things are just - Ὁσα δικαια· Whatsoever is agreeable to justice and righteousness. All that ye owe to God, to your neighbor, and to yourselves.
-->
<p>d. <strong>Whatsoever things are pure</strong></p>
<!-- copy paste
Chaste - in thought, in feeling, and in the conversation between the sexes; compare the notes at 1 Timothy 5:2.

Whatsoever things are pure - Ὁσα ἁγνα· Whatsoever is chaste. In reference to the state of the mind, and to the acts of the body.
-->
<p>e. <strong>Whatsoever things are lovely</strong></p>
<!-- copy paste
The word used here means properly what is dear to anyone; then what is pleasing. Here it means what is amiable - such a temper of mind that one can love it; or such as to be agreeable to others. A Christian should not be sour, crabby, or irritable in his temper - for nothing almost tends so much to injure the cause of religion as a temper always chafed; a brow morose and stern; an eye that is severe and unkind, and a disposition to find fault with everything. And yet it is to be regretted that there are many persons who make no pretensions to piety, who far surpass many professors of religion in the virtue here commended. A sour and crabby temper in a professor of religion will undo all the good that he attempts to do.

Whatsoever things are lovely - Ὁσα προσφιλη· Whatsoever is amiable on its own account and on account of its usefulness to others, whether in your conduct or conversation.

-->
<p>f. <strong>Whatsoever things are of good report</strong></p>
<!-- copy paste
That is, whatsoever is truly reputable in the world at large. There are actions which all people agree in commending, and which in all ages and countries are regarded as virtues. courtesy, urbanity, kindness, respect for parents, purity between brothers and sisters, are among those virtues, and the Christian should be a pattern and an example in them all. His usefulness depends much more on the cultivation of these virtues than is commonly supposed.

Whatsoever things are of good report - Ὁσα ευφημα· Whatsoever things the public agree to acknowledge as useful and profitable to men; such as charitable institutions of every kind, in which genuine Christians should ever take the lead.
-->
<p>g. <strong>If there be any virtue</strong></p>
<!-- copy paste
If there is anything truly virtuous. Paul did not suppose that he had given a full catalogue of the virtues which he would have cultivated. He, therefore, adds, that if there was anything else that had the nature of true virtue in it, they should be careful to cultivate that also. The Christian should be a pattern and an example of every virtue.

If there be any virtue - If they be calculated to promote the general good of mankind, and are thus praiseworthy;
-->
<p>h. <strong>And if there be any praise</strong></p>
<!-- copy paste
Anything worthy of praise, or that ought to be praised.
-->
<p>i. <strong>Think on these things</strong></p>
<!-- copy paste
Let them be the object of your careful attention and study, so as to practice them. Think what they are; think on the obligation to observe them; think on the influence which they would have on the world around you.

Think on these things - Esteem them highly, recommend them heartily, and practice them fervently.
-->
<p>In contrast to the troubles all around us in the world and the ever increasting advance of evil.</p>

<p>10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. 11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. 12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction. 15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. 19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</p>
