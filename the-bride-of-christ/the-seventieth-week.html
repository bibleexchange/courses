<h1><span lang="en">The Seventieth Week</span></h1><p><span lang="en">The Seven Years of Tribulation</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Dan. 9: 24 &quot;Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city&#44; to finish the transgression&#44; and to make an end of sins&#44; and to make reconciliation for iniquity&#44; and to bring in everlasting righteousness&#44; and to seal up the vision and prophecy&#44; and to anoint the most Holy.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Seventy Weeks of years were determined (given by decree) to the Jewish nation. Sixty-nine of those weeks of years have already been fulfilled. There is yet one week of years that must be fulfilled; seven years that God will again deal with the nation of Israel. Between the sixty-ninth and seventieth week there is a period of grace in which God deals with all the world. We are now living in that period of grace.</span></p><p><span lang="en">According to what I understand from prophetic truth&#44; there will be another World War in which God will fight for the nation of Israel&#44; as He did in the Old Testament. This will be the ushering in of the SeventiethWeek of years&#44; which is often referred to as the Seven Years of Tribulation. Before this World War the Bride of Christ (the Overcomer) will be translated&#44;as is plainly revealed in the Scripture. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 21: 36 &quot;Watch ye therefore&#44; and pray always&#44; that ye may be accounted worthy to Escape <b>all these things that</b> shall come to pass&#44; and to stand before the Son of Man.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Bride of Christ will be translated in the <b>First Watch</b> of the night which is followed by the dark night of Tribulation.
