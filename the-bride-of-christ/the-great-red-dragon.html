This indicates the fullness of evil and wickedness. Dragons ordinarily were given one head&#44;but this dragon possesses &quot;seven heads.&quot; Two heads would indicate confusion. Here there are seven heads. &quot;Seven heads&quot; also reveal a total and complete state of confusion. The

</u> is the seat of governing power and it implies rule and control. The fact there are seven heads should be understood in the same sense that we read of &quot;<i>the seven Spirits of God</i>&quot; -- a manifold unity.
