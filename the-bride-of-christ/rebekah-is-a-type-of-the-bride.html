Why do ye not understand Myspeech? even because ye cannot hear My Word. Ye are of your father the devil&#44;and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning&#44;and abode not in the truth&#44; because there is no truth in him.

And Abraham rose up early in themorning&#44; and saddled his ass&#44; and took two of his young men with him&#44; and Isaachis son&#44; and clave the wood for the burnt offering&#44; and rose up&#44; and went untothe place of which God had told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted uphis eyes&#44; and saw the place afar off. And Abraham said unto his young men&#44;Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship&#44; andcome again to you. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering&#44; and laidit upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand&#44; and a knife; and theywent both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father&#44; and said&#44;My father: and he said&#44; Here am I&#44; my son. And he said&#44; Behold the fire and thewood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? And Abraham said&#44; My son&#44; Godwill provide Himself a Lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of themtogether. And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abrahambuilt an altar there&#44; and laid the wood in order&#44; and bound Isaac his son&#44; andlaid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand&#44; andtook the knife to slay his son.

And He said&#44;Lay not thine hand upon the lad&#44; neither do thou any thing unto him: for now Iknow that thou fearest God&#44; seeing thou hast not withheld thy son&#44; thine onlyson from Me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes&#44; and looked&#44; and behold behind hima ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram&#44; andoffered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. And Abrahamcalled the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day&#44; In themount of the LORD it shall be seen. And the Angel of the LORD called untoAbraham out of heaven the second time&#44; And said&#44; By Myself have I sworn&#44; saiththe LORD&#44; for because thou hast done this thing&#44; and hast not withheld thy son&#44;thine only son: That in blessing I will bless thee&#44; and in multiplying I willmultiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven&#44; and as the sand which is upon thesea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; And in thy seedshall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed Myvoice.

He did not want him to marry one of the Canaanites&#44;among whom they lived&#44; because they were evil and unbelievers. God had said they were not to intermarry.

Remember&#44; it is not all that are in the Family of God (the Saved; the BornAgain) nor is it all that are in the Church (the Body of Christ)&#44; that will bein the Bride.

And the damselwas very fair to look upon&#44; a virgin&#44; neither had any man known her: and shewent down to the well&#44; and filled her pitcher&#44; and came up.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Before he had finished praying Rebekah came and she &quot;<i>...wasvery fair to look upon&#44; a virgin...</i>&quot; The Bride of Christ is going to be fairto look upon; not adorned with coverings of the world. In the eyes of the HolySpirit&#44; she is going to be very fair to look upon; pure&#44; holy&#44; righteous. TheLord&#39;s Bride is going to look holy&#44; dress holy and be holy.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 7&#44; 8 &quot;Let us be glad and rejoice&#44; and give honour to Him: for themarriage of the Lamb is come&#44; and His wife hath made herself ready.

It is the righteousness of&quot;<i>good works</i>&#44;&quot; for which we were &quot;<i>...created in Christ Jesus unto goodworks&#44; which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</i>&quot; (Eph.2: 10) This is not imputed righteousness that we received when we acceptedChrist as our Saviour; this is acquired righteousness that is gained byobedience to the Word of God.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Bride Will Be Willing to Fulfill All Righteousness</span></p><p><span lang="en">Rebekah met the requirements of the servant for the Bride. The servant&#39;s request was that the Bride give him drink and give the camelsdrink. These ten camels had traveled a long way through a desert land&#44; andwould have been very thirsty. Camels are able to drink enough to last themseven days. The ten camels are a type of the Law of God. The law requiresmuch and cannot be easily satisfied.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Bride Will be Willing to Forsake All</span></p><p><span lang="en">She had to be willing to leave her father&#39;s house. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Gen. 24: 58  &quot;...They called Rebekah&#44; and said unto her&#44; Wilt thou go withthis man? And she said&#44; I will go.&quot; </span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">As Rebekah met all the requirements of the servant&#44; solikewise the Bride of Christ will meet all the requirements of the Holy Spirit.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Being baptized in the Holy Spirit and speaking in othertongues does not necessarily qualify one to be the Bride. However&#44; it doesgive one access to become a part of the Bride. To be a part of the Bride theremust be a willingness and a dedication to the Lord to obey all that Herequires. One must also submit to the Holy Spirit&#44; allowing Him to sanctifyand bring them into perfection (maturity). God has given the Holy Spirit theresponsibility of perfecting the Bride&#44; and He is performing the work in thehearts of those who will yield to Him.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;Wilt thou go with this man?&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Bride Will Thirst for Fullness</span></p><p><span lang="en">It is very interesting that Eliezer went to the well tosearch for a bride. Jesus said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en"> Jn. 7: 37 &quot;If any man thirst&#44; let him come unto Me&#44; and drink.&quot; </span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Those who will make up the Bride will always be thirstingfor more.
