<h1><span lang="en">The War in Heaven</span></h1><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 7 &quot;And there was <b>war in heaven</b>...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">I understand this text to be describing a real battle ofviolent dimensions that takes place in the heavenly realm. Without question&#44;there is coming a time of &quot;war&quot; that will be the greatest conflict of allages.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Right now&#44; at this present time&#44; every day of our life&#44; weare in a battle. The Apostle Paul says&#44; &quot;For we wrestle... againstprincipalities&#44; against powers&#44; against the rulers of the darkness of thisworld&#44; against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot; Every time that the Lorddoes something for us&#44; or reveals truth to us&#44; the devil will contend for it. He will attack from every angle and cause you to doubt (if possible) that whichGod is doing. This is especially so in this 
<u>end
</u>-
<u>time
</u>.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Many are giving up truth in this day because of the battle&#44;the struggle&#44; the conflict&#44; to take the way of least resistance; supposedly theeasy way is the right way. However&#44; I want you to know there is an awfulawakening coming to the Church in the Tribulation Hour. The Church comes tothis awakening after the Bride (the Man-Child; the Overcomer) has been caughtup to God and to His throne&#44; and they have been left behind to go into thefirst three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation.</span></p><p><span lang="en">There have been many battles&#44; but this is 
<u>war
</u>&#44; thelast great conflict&#44; when the devil is cast out of heaven. There was a battlein Eden when the devil deceived Eve and man lost his position with God. Therewas a battle in hell when Christ fought and overcame the hosts of hell. He nowhas &quot;<i>...the keys of hell and of death.</i>&quot; This conflict that we are nowcontemplating is not just a battle&#44; but a war. Men&#44; with the help of Michaeland his angels&#44; lay claim to the fullness of redemption&#44; overcome the devil andgain the rights to the throne.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Those that are of a skeptical mind ridicule the idea of aliteral war. They are astonished that reasonable men could believe in such anevent and pass it off as mere fiction. I am personally astonished thatreasonable&#44; thinking men cannot believe the truth as it is recorded in God&#39;sholy&#44; infallible&#44; immutable and eternal Word.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Others believe that this is a mere poetical and exaggeratedaccount of certain moral conflicts in the history of the Church on earth. Again&#44; we must believe the Bible to be the Word of God that is free from errorand exaggeration. Otherwise&#44; if it has even the slightest hint of exaggerationor error&#44; it is not worth the paper upon which it is written.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">II Tim. 3: 16 &quot;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God&#44; and isprofitable for doctrine&#44; for reproof&#44; for correction&#44; for instruction inrighteousness:&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The meaning of the word &quot;<i>inspiration&quot;</i>means &quot;Godbreathed.&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">II Pet. 1: 21 &quot;For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">&quot;Phero&quot; -- &quot;Moved&quot; -- not expressing their own thoughts&#44; butexpressing the mind of God</span></p><p><span lang="en">Some believe the dragon to be the Pagan Roman Empire;Michael&#44; the Christian Roman Empire; Heaven&#44; the throne of Roman Emperors; andthe war in heaven&#44; the conflicts between the Pagan and Christian RomanEmperors. You do not have to go too far to prove the falsehood of this theory.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out&#44; that old serpent called thedevil&#44; and satan&#44; which deceiveth the whole world:&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">There are some that teach we are not to believe this was anactual event&#44; but a sort of a summary of the prolonged battle between good andevil. There are several things that we need to remember in understanding thisgreat event.</span></p><p><span lang="en">First&#44; this is not a record of history. This is a book ofprophecy with events that will take place after the recording of theRevelation. It is a divinely inspired record that John received while he wasin the Spirit on the Lord&#39;s Day. &quot;<i>The Lord&#39;s Day</i>&quot; has to do withend-time events and the judgment of God. This is not a prolonged battlebetween good and evil. All these events take place in a relatively short periodof time&#44; approximately seven years.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 22: 18&#44; 19 &quot;For I testify unto every man that heareth the words ofthe prophecy of this book&#44; If any man shall add unto these things&#44; God shalladd unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shalltake away from the words of the book of this prophecy&#44; God shall take away hispart out of the Book of Life&#44; and out of the holy city&#44; and from the thingswhich are written in this book.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">It is best to take heed to this warning. Remember&#44; this isa divinely inspired revelation that states very clearly&#44; &quot;<i>And there was warin heaven.</i>&quot; If the Bible states infallibly&#44; &quot;<i>And there was war inheaven&#44;</i>&quot; then we have no choice but to believe it as stated. This is aliteral war fought in the heavenly realm between the dragon (satan; the devil)and the &quot;Man-Child&quot; who is supported by Michael and his angels.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 1: 14 &quot;Are they not all ministering spirits&#44; sent forth to ministerfor them who shall be heirs of salvation?&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">  The Cause of this War</span></h2><p><span lang="en">The Enthroning of the &quot;Man-Child&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 5 &quot;And she brought forth a man child&#44; who was to rule all nationswith a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God&#44; and to His throne.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The &quot;Woman&quot; (the Church) is pictured in the preceding verseas travailing in birth to bring forth a &quot;Man-Child&quot; destined to rule allnations. The dragon stood before the &quot;Woman&quot; who was ready to be delivered&#44;for to devour her child. The birth&#44; in which the Woman labors to bring forththe child&#44; is the birth into immortality by both resurrection and translation. The saints of old that died in faith&#44; not having received the promise but werepersuaded of it&#44; will be resurrected and included with the overcomers in thetranslation. The Scripture clearly states that they&#44; without the overcomingcompany&#44; could not be made perfect. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 11: 39&#44; 40 &quot;And these all&#44; having obtained a good report throughfaith&#44; received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us&#44;that <b>
<u>they without us</u></b> should not bemade perfect.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This birth is &quot;<i>...the manifestation of the sons of God</i>&quot;which is referred to in Rom. 8: 19.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The devil is determined to stop the &quot;Man-Child&quot; from goingto the throne. Therefore&#44; there is reason to believe that <b>
<u>all</u></b>the power and strength of the adversary with his angels <b>
<u>are</u></b>positioned to prevent the &quot;Man-Child&quot; from going to the throne. With thedominion of death broken&#44; and the reign of satan broken&#44; satan loses his&quot;place&quot; (position).</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...And her child was caught up unto God&#44; and to His throne.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Devil&#39;s Place</span></p><p><span lang="en">What was hisplace?</span></p><h4><span lang="en">A Place of Light -- Isa. 14: 12</span></h4><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...O Lucifer&#44; (O day star) son of the morning...&quot;</span></blockquote><h4><span lang="en">A Place of Wisdom -- Eze. 28: 12</span></h4><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...Full of Wisdom...&quot;</span></blockquote><h4><span lang="en">A Place of Beauty -- Eze. 28: 12</span></h4><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...Perfect in Beauty&quot;</span></blockquote><h4><span lang="en">A Place of Perfection -- Eze. 28: 15</span></h4><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;Thou wast perfect in thy ways...&quot;</span></blockquote><h4><span lang="en">A Place of Power -- Isa. 14: 16; Heb. 2: 14</span></h4><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...Made the earth to tremble&#44; that did shake kingdoms;&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The devil has &quot;<i>the 
<u>power
</u> of 
<u>death
</u></i>.&quot; Death is an enemy that shall be destroyed. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 15: 26 &quot;The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Lucifer was the highest order of all God&#39;s creation&#44;occupying the closest position to God. Though he has defaulted on thisposition&#44; he still occupies this position until someone takes it from him.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Therefore&#44; the &quot;War in Heaven&quot; is over the &quot;Man-Child&quot; goingto the throne to take the position Lucifer had. Rev. 12: 7&#44; 8 says the deviland his angels fought&#44; &quot;<i>...And prevailed not; neither was their place foundany more in heaven.</i>&quot; Michael and his angels fought on behalf of the&quot;Man-Child.&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 1: 14 &quot;Are they not all ministering spirits&#44; sent forth to ministerfor them who shall be heirs of salvation?&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rom. 16: 20 &quot;And the God of peace shall bruise satan under your feetshortly...&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">The Forces of This War</span></h2><p><span lang="en">Michael and His Angels</span></p><p><span lang="en">Michael is believed by some to be Christ. If this was true&#44;why would Jude 9 be stated as it is?</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Jude 9 &quot;Yet Michael the archangel&#44; when contending with the devil hedisputed about the body of Moses&#44; durst not bring against him a railingaccusation&#44; but said&#44; The Lord rebuke thee.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Lord Jesus Christ does have His angels&#44; but there isnothing in this fact that proves that an Archangel does not have his angels&#44; aswell. In Dan. 10: 13 Michael is called <i>&quot;...one of the chief princes...&quot;</i>Therefore&#44; there must be others of the same rank.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Michael is referred to by this name in the Holy Scripturefive different times as a proper name&#44; denoting a distinct angel of high rank. According to Jewish teaching&#44; Michael is only one of the seven Archangels; andof the seven he is believed to be chief.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Dragon and His Angels</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 7 &quot;...And the dragon fought and his angels&#44;&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">There stands opposed to God and His people&#44; a greatmalignant kingdom&#44; a vast empire of evil.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 6: 11&#44; 12 &quot;...The wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against fleshand blood&#44; but against principalities&#44; against powers&#44; against the rulers ofthe darkness of this world&#44; against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The devil&#39;s angels are those that kept not their firstestate but followed satan in revolt against God.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Jude 6 &quot;And the angels which kept not their first estate&#44; but left theirown habitation...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">These that revolted against God have become the devil&#39;sangels that will one day be cast into the fire prepared for the devil and hisangels.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 41 &quot;...Depart from me&#44; ye cursed&#44; into everlasting fire&#44; <b>
<u>prepared for the devil and his angels</u></b>:&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">These angels did not abide in the truth. They of their ownfree--will revolted against the authority and rule of heaven&#44; and became theenemies of God and His Kingdom.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The devil himself is referred to in Scripture as &quot;the princeof this world&#44;&quot; &quot;the prince and power of the air&#44;&quot; and &quot;the god of thisworld.&quot; He is called here in Rev. 12 &quot;the great dragon&#44;&quot; &quot;that old serpent&#44;&quot;&quot;the devil&quot; and &quot;satan.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">The &quot;Man-Child&quot; - The Bride - The Overcomers</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 11 &quot;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb&#44; and by theWord of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The War in Heaven is with&#44; and on behalf of&#44; the&quot;Man-Child.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Overcomers are born again&#44; Holy Ghost baptizedbelievers.

<u>power of the blood
</u> and by the Word of their confession. Just as the LordHimself overcame the assaults of the devil by the Word&#44; so the &quot;Man-Child&quot; willovercome by the Word. The defense that the &quot;Man-Child&quot; gives is the &quot;Logos&quot;(the Word)&#44; saying the same thing that God says.</span></p><p><span lang="en">God is preparing and training a people for battle&#44; in theselast days. This whole vision revolves around the truth that there is going tobe a war in heaven. The Overcomers which have overcome in this present timewill be the Overcomers that fight and become victorious in this &quot;<i>War</i>.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Overcomers (the Man-Child; the Bride of Christ) areheaded for the throne. Rev. 3: 21 says they will have to fight with the forcesof darkness that will contend with them in the heavenly realm for this positionon the throne. All those that want to be there (to attain the throne) mustlearn to overcome <b>
<u>now</u></b> so that they will be prepared to &quot;Overcome&quot;in the &quot;War in Heaven.&quot; Many in the Church are being overcome in thisLaodicean Age.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 17 &quot;Because thou sayest&#44; I am rich&#44; and increased with goods&#44; andhave need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched&#44; and miserable&#44;and poor&#44; and blind&#44; and naked:&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 20 &quot;Behold&#44; I stand at the door&#44; and knock: <b>
