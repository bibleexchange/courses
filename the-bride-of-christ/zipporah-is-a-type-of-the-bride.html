And he looked this way andthat way&#44; and when he saw that there was no man&#44; he slew the Egyptian&#44; and hidhim in the sand. And when he went out the second day&#44; behold&#44; two men of theHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong&#44; Whereforesmitest thou thy fellow? And he said&#44; Who made thee a prince and a judge overus? intendest thou to kill me&#44; as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared&#44;and said&#44; Surely this thing is known. Now when Pharaoh heard this thing&#44; hesought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh&#44; and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. Now the priest of Midian hadseven daughters: and they came and drew water&#44; and filled the troughs to watertheir father&apos;s flock. And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stoodup and helped them&#44; and watered their flock. And when they came to Reuel theirfather&#44; he said&#44; How is it that ye are come so soon to day? And they said&#44; AnEgyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds&#44; and also drew waterenough for us&#44; and watered the flock. And he said unto his daughters&#44; Andwhere is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him&#44; that he may eatbread. And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporahhis daughter. And she bare him a son&#44; and he called his name Gershom: for hesaid&#44; I have been a stranger in a strange land.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Moses&#44; a prominent and outstanding Bible character&#44; is atype of Christ. He was birthed under the sentence and penalty of death. Theking&#39;s command was that all male babies were to be killed. However&#44; Godprotected Moses as He did the Christ--child . At his birth he was seen to be a&quot;<i>goodly child.</i>&quot; (Ex. 2: 2) He was &quot;<i>exceeding fair.</i>&quot; (Acts 7: 20)</span></p><p><span lang="en">Moses was hid for three months in his father&#39;s house&#44; fromthe king&#39;s command of death. Likewise&#44; Christ was hid from the king&#39;s commandthat &quot;<i>...all the children that were in Bethlehem&#44; ...from two years old andunder...</i>&quot; were to be slain. (Matt. 2: 16)</span></p><p><span lang="en">Like Christ&#44; Moses chose to suffer affliction.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 11: 25 &quot;Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">They did not have to suffer&#44; but it was their choice tosuffer.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Like Christ&#44; Moses refused the riches of this world&#44; &quot;<i>...forhe had respect unto the recompense of the reward.</i>&quot; (Heb. 11: 26)</span></p><p><span lang="en">Like Christ&#44; Moses&#44; when rejected by his own people went tothe Gentiles. There in the land of Midian&#44; Moses was received and accepted. In the Gospel of John&#44; the first chapter&#44; it is said of Christ that &quot;<i>He cameunto His own&#44; and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him&#44; tothem gave He power to become the sons of God...</i>&quot; (Jn. 1: 11&#44; 12)</span></p><p><span lang="en">There in the land of Midian&#44; Moses was given a bride. Hername was Zipporah&#44; which means &quot;a little bird -- that soars high.&quot; Zipporah was birthed&#44; raised and instructed under the priestly ministry of Reuel&#44; her father. In fulfillment of this type the Bride of Christ will be birthed&#44;raised and instructed under the priestly ministry of the Church.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">   Went to His Own </span></h2><p><span lang="en">Moses went to his own. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Ex. 2: 11 &quot;And it came to pass in those days&#44; when Moses was grown&#44; that he went out unto his brethren...&quot; </span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Acts 7: 23 &quot;...It came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">Christ went to His own.</span></h2><blockquote><span lang="en">Jn. 1: 11 &quot;He came unto His own&#44; and His own received Him not.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">Bore Burdens </span></h2><p><span lang="en">Moses saw the burdens of his people.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Ex. 2: 11 &quot;...And looked on their burdens...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Christ saw the burdens of His people.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 8: 17 &quot;That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet&#44; saying&#44; Himself took our infirmities&#44; and bare our sicknesses.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">Slew the Egyptian (the devil)</span></h2><p><span lang="en">Moses slew the Egyptian which was the enemy of the Hebrews&#44;God&#39;s people. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Ex. 2: 11&#44; 12 &quot;...And he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew&#44; one of his brethren.
