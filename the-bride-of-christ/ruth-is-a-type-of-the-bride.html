Christ will have a Gentile bride in fulfillment of this type.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Like the Bride of Christ&#44; Ruth had an obedient heart ready to follow wherever she was led&#44; and to do whatever was required of her. Like the Bride of Christ&#44; Ruth had a heart that was willing to give up all that was in Moab&#44; to be a part of the kingdom of God. Ruth said to Naomi&#44; &quot;<i>Thy God shall be my God</i>.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">Like the Bride of Christ&#44; Ruth had a servant&#39;s heart willing to take the place of a servant gleaning corn in the field. She was willing to serve wherever she could.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Like the Bride of Christ&#44; Ruth had a humble heart. In response to Boaz recognition of her&#44; she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground. (Ruth 2:10)</span></p><p><span lang="en">Ruth&#44; like the Bride of Christ&#44; was not proud&#44; arrogant&#44; or flirtatious as are so many in the Church today. </span></p><p><span lang="en">Ruth&#44; like the Bride of Christ&#44; will love no part of the world. Ruth had but one love and that was for her kinsman redeemer&#44; Boaz. The Bride of Christ will have but one love and that will be for her kinsman redeemer&#44; Christ. The Word of God says&#44; &quot;<i>Love not the world&#44; neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world <b>the love of the Father is not in him</b>.</i>&quot; (I Jn. 2:15)</span></p>

The people of Bethlehem said&#44; &quot;<i>Is this </i>(not)<i> Naomi?</i>&quot; She said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Ruth 1: 20&#44; 21 &quot;...Call me not 
<u>Naomi
</u> (pleasantness)&#44; call me Mara(bitterness): for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. I went out full&#44; and the Lord hath brought me home again empty...&quot; </span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">She is blaming God for her losses in Moab. It was <b>
<u>her choice</u></b> to go to Moab. By her own testimony God had been good to her while she was in Bethlehem. She said&#44; &quot;<i>I went out full.</i>&quot; While in Moab she suffered the loss of everything and came <i>&quot;...homeagain empty.&quot;</i></span></p>
<h4><span lang="en">Ruth&#39;s Attitude</span></h4><p><span lang="en">Ruth had a different attitude. She was happy to be in Bethlehem (the House of Bread).

<h2><span lang="en">The Kinsman Redeemer</span></h2>

She was willing to go into the fields to labor and glean. It was not long after Ruth gleaned in the fields of Boaz&#44; that Boaz recognized the beauty of Ruth. In Ruth 2: 8 Boaz said unto Ruth:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...Go not to glean in another field&#44; neither go from hence&#44; but abide here fast by my maidens.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">In Ruth 2: 14 Boaz said to Ruth:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;At meal time come thou hither&#44; and eat of the bread&#44; (His Bread --Revelation) and dip thy morsel in the vinegar...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This vinegar could be wine&#44; a type of the &quot;New Wine&quot; (the Holy Spirit).
