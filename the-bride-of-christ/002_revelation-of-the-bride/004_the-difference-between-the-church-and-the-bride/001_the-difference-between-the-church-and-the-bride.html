<h1><span lang="en">The Difference Between the Church and the Bride</span></h1><blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 12: 35--38 &quot;Let your loins be girded about&#44; and your lights burning;and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord&#44; when He will returnfrom the wedding; that when He cometh and knocketh&#44; they may open unto Himimmediately. Blessed are those servants&#44; whom the Lord when He cometh shallfind watching; verily I say unto you&#44; that He shall gird Himself&#44; and make themto sit down to meat&#44; and will come forth and serve them. And if He shall comein the second watch&#44; or come in the third watch and find them so&#44; blessed arethose servants.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en"> This Scripture indicates the Midnight hour -- between the second and the third watch.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 6 &quot;And at midnight there was a cry made&#44; Behold&#44; the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">The Church is the Body</span></h2><p><span lang="en">The Body of Christ (the Church) and the Bride of Christ are not the same. The Body of Christ (the Church) are those that have been BornAgain (Saved) and been baptized by the Spirit into the Body of Christ (theChurch).</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 12: 13 &quot;For <b>
<u>by one Spirit</u></b> are we all <b>
<u>baptized</u></b> into one body.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 1: 22&#44; 23 &quot;And hath put all things under His feet&#44; and gave Him to be the head over all things to the <b>
<u>Church</u></b>. Which is His <b>
<u>body</u></b>&#44;the fullness of Him that filleth all in all.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Scripture is plain that the Bride of Christ is only a part of the Body of Christ. That is&#44; the Bride of Christ will be taken out of theBody of Christ (the Church). These are Overcomers as was Christ Himself.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 21 &quot;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in MyThrone&#44; even as I also overcame...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">As Eve was taken out of the

<u>body</u> of Christ (the Church).</span></p><p><span lang="en">Nowhere in the Bible&#44; God&#39;s Holy Word&#44; is the Church called the Bride of Christ. The Church is called the Body of Christ&#44; of which Christ is always referred to as being the Head of the Church&#44; which is His body. (Eph. 1: 22&#44; 23)</span></p><p><span lang="en">Overcoming does not gain salvation&#44; for salvation is a gift of God.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 2: 8&#44; 9 &quot;For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works&#44; lest any man should boast.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Salvation is not earned. It cannot be earned. It is given and received as a gift of grace&#44; through faith. However&#44; the Bride earns herholy position by attainment and overcoming. This is accomplished by appropriation of every redemptive right by faith.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 8 &quot;And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in finelinen&#44; clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness (acquired righteousness&#44; righteous acts) of saints.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">The Overcomer is the Bride</span></h2><p><span lang="en">The Bride of Christ is Called to an &quot;High Calling&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en"> This is gained by pressing &quot;...toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Phil. 3: 11--14 &quot;If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained&#44; either were already perfect:but I follow after&#44; if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

I press toward the mark for the prize.</i>&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">I Cor. 9: 24--27 &quot;Know ye not that they which run in a race run all&#44; but one receiveth the prize? So run&#44; that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now <b>they</b> do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but <b>we</b> an incorruptible. I therefore so run&#44; not as uncertainly; so fight I&#44; not as one that beateth the air: But I keep under my body&#44; and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means&#44; when I have preached to others&#44; I myself should be a castaway.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">Paul is speaking about running a race to win a prize: I strive - I run - I fight to win a prize.
