Jesus answered and said unto him&#44; Verily&#44; verily&#44; I say unto thee&#44; Excepta man be born again&#44; he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith untoHim&#44; How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time intohis mother&apos;s womb&#44; and be born? Jesus answered&#44; Verily&#44; verily&#44; I say untothee&#44; Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit&#44; he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which isborn of the Spirit is spirit.

The same Seed (the Word) produces different results&#44; not because of the Seed&#44; but because of the soil (the lives) in which it is sowed.

This 100-fold is completeness&#44; perfection&#44; maturity and fullgrowth. </span></p><p><span lang="en">The Apostle Paul said that there is a difference in believers&#44; even though all build on the foundation&#44; which is Christ. Some will build on this foundation precious stone&#44; some silver and some gold. These are not the same&#44; nor do they attain unto the same level of reward; yet&#44; they all build on the same foundation&#44; which is Christ Jesus the Saviour. For there is no

But He answered and said&#44; Verily I say unto you&#44; I know you not.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">He did not say He <b>
<u>never knew</u></b> them. They were virgins. He is saying that He does not know them in this experience of being invited to the Marriage Feast.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Some will come out of Great Tribulation like the five foolish virgins that go into it (the last three-and-a-half years of theTribulation) and during which&#44; washed their robes and made them white in theBlood of the Lamb. The only reason for them to be washing their robes in the Great Tribulation is because they have allowed their garments to become defiled&#44; and were not allowed to go into the Marriage Feast.</span></p>
