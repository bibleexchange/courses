She was a remarkable lady in that she had an obedientspirit and always did what Mordecai commanded. (Esther 2: 20) Mordecai is a typeof the law. The Bride of Christ will be willing to obey all that is commandedin the Law of God.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Esther was a very wise&#44; brave&#44; faithful and dedicatedindividual&#44; as the Bride of Christ will be. Esther was willing to die to beobedient rather than try to escape the judgment that was pronounced upon herand her people.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Esther 4: 16 &quot;If I perish&#44; I perish...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Like the Bride of Christ&#44; Esther was a virgin that wasselected for her beauty from among many other virgins. There was a reason whyEsther was chosen over the others. During the time of her purification&#44; sherequired nothing but what Hegai&#44; the kings chamberlain&#44; appointed. (Esther 2:15)</span></p><p><span lang="en">Hegai&#44; the king&#39;s chamberlain&#44; is a type of the HolySpirit. Esther followed the leading and instruction of Hegai.

His name means&quot;Majestic Prince.&quot; Ahasuerus was the greatest king on the earth. Vashti&#44;being self-willed&#44; refused to give up her present enjoyment of her self-madeplans to obey the king&#39;s command. Like Vashti&#44; the Jews were bound by thetraditions of their fathers and rejected the commands of God.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Vashti&#39;s disobedience led to her being rejected as thequeen. Although she was still in his kingdom and under his rule and authority&#44;she lost her position as queen. Without question&#44; she did not think thissimple act of disobedience would result in such disastrous consequences.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Esther 1: 19 &quot;That Vashti come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let theking give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rom. 11: 21&#44; 22 &quot;For if God spared not the natural branches&#44; take heedlest He also spare not thee.

(Esther 2: 8&#44; 9&#44; 15)</span></p><p><span lang="en">Esther was also obedient in everything Mordecai (a type ofthe Law) commanded. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Esther 2: 20 &quot;...For Esther did the commandment of Mordecai&#44; like as whenshe was brought up with him.&quot; </span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Bride will be obedient to the leading and guidance ofthe Holy Spirit&#44; and to the <b>revelation of the Word</b> as taught by theSpirit.
