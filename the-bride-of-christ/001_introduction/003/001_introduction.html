<h1><span lang="en">Introduction</span></h1><p><span lang="en">It is the duty and responsibility of the preacher to declare the whole counsel of God. In Acts 20: 27 the Apostle Paul said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Whether or not it is accepted or rejected is not the responsibility of the preacher. His duty is to declare the truth as it is recorded in the Word of God. It is imperative that believers know the truth&#44;not someone&#39;s ideas about the truth. In Jn. 8: 32 Jesus said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...Ye shall know the truth&#44; and the truth shall make you free.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">In writing this book I have endeavored to let the Word ofGod speak for itself. However&#44; there is a lot of mystery in the Word of God and where that is evident I have depended on the Holy Spirit to reveal themystery.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Paul said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 2: 9&#44; 10 &quot;...Eye hath not seen&#44; nor ear heard&#44; neither have entered into the heart of man&#44; the things which God hath prepared for them that loveHim. But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things&#44; yea&#44; the deep things of God.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">There is mystery in the Word of God concerning the Church&#44;the true Church (the Body of Christ)&#44; which Christ said He would build and the gates of hell would not prevail against it.</span></p><p><span lang="en">There is mystery in the Word of God concerning the Bride ofChrist. Throughout this book I have endeavored to explain the mysteries as God revealed them to me by dreams&#44; visions&#44; revelations&#44; and His speaking by HisSpirit.</span></p><p><span lang="en">My first experience was many years ago while reading and studying the diagrams of a well-known writer&#44; the Spirit of the Lord spoke tome and said&#44; &quot;What you are reading is wrong.&quot; Immediately&#44; He led me through the Scripture and unfolded the truth to me&#44; scripture after scripture. This is what I will be doing throughout this book&#44; revealing the truth as the HolySpirit revealed it to me.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Before you judge the book&#44; please read it thoroughly. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Prov. 18: 13 &quot;He that answereth a matter before he heareth it&#44; it is folly and shame unto him.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Rev.
