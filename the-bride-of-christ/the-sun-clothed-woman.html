<h1><span lang="en">The Sun Clothed Woman</span></h1><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 1&#44; 2 &quot;And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun&#44; and the moon under her feet&#44; and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: And she being with child cried&#44; travailing in birth&#44; and pained to be delivered.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Book of Revelation is one of the most important writings in the Word of God. It has withstood attacks in every age. There is not another book in sacred Scripture more strongly attested&#44; or more fully authenticated. Its title&#44; its historical declaration&#44; the nature of its contents and the prophetic statements are ample evidence of its genuine and divine origin.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Whenever the Spirit of God reveals truth&#44; you will find that the adversary will attack that truth. If you preach a diluted message of salvation (social gospel)&#44; the adversary will not trouble you much. He knows that the Tribulation is imminent and those that are ignorant of the truth and not living in the light of truth will go into the Tribulation.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Hosea 4: 6 &quot;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The devil is not fighting the luke-warm Christian. He ispositioned and stationed wherever the truth is revealed. He is fighting thetruth of the revelation of God for this hour. The Scripture shows exactly where the devil is stationed today.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 4 &quot;...And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to bedelivered&#44; (for one purpose) for to devour her child as soon as it was born.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This is the Sun-Clothed Woman John had spoken about&#44; <i>&quot;...beingwith child... travailing in birth&#44; and pained to be delivered.&quot;</i>The Woman isready to give birth. The devil is standing before the Woman ready to 
<u>devour
</u>her child as soon as he is brought forth. He 
<u>devours
</u> by destroying the truth.</span></p><p><span lang="en">One must remember&#44; there are definite points of division inthe book of Revelation and here&#44; this twelfth chapter&#44; is one of the dividing points. The eleventh chapter ends with the last of the Tribulation and the beginning of the Millennium Reign of Christ. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 11: 15 &quot;And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices inheaven&#44; saying&#44; The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord&#44;and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">In the fulfillment of <b>
<u>this</u></b> part of the prophecy&#44; we are going back into the Church Age. In this passage a <b>woman</b>is pictured clothed with the sun&#44; and the moon under her feet&#44; and on her heada crown of twelve stars. She is agonizing in pain and travailing to bedelivered of a

This text reveals a woman being used in a symbolic manner&#44; representing something else that is the true or real subject being considered.</span></p><p><span lang="en">One version of the Bible states that &quot;a great sign was seenin heaven.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Amplified New Testament says&#44; &quot;And a great sign (wonderwarning of future events of ominous significance) appeared in heaven.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">Dr. J. A. Seiss in his 
<u>Lectures of the Apocalypse
</u>says&#44; &quot;I have repeatedly remarked that when the Scripture uses figures orsymbols&#44; or speaks in a way not intended to be taken literally&#44; like allserious writings they always give some intimation of it&#44; in one way oranother. The text is a case in point. What is described is said to be a&quot;sign&#44;&quot; a representation or picture of something else -- a symbol. And the factthat we are here told that this is a sign&#44; goes far to prove that the Apocalypsein general is to be taken literally&#44; except where indication to the contrary isgiven.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">Here the Apostle says&#44; &quot;<i>And there appeared a great wonder</i>(sign)<i> in heaven;</i>&quot; Something is very mysteriously happening.</span></p><p><span lang="en">It was an Important Sign</span></p><p><span lang="en">&quot;A great sign&quot; -- indicates something of great importance andremarkable significance. </span></p><p><span lang="en">&quot;Megas&quot; -- &quot;Great&quot; -- extraordinary -- important -- miracle</span></p><p><span lang="en">The whole scene is extremely remarkable&#44; marvelous andextraordinary as to demand the idea of something of the greatest importance. It ought to be important enough to attract attention to consider and examine itcarefully.</span></p><h2><span lang="en">The Location of This Revelation</span></h2><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...A great wonder in heaven...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">It was in the Spirit</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 1: 10 &quot;I was in the Spirit on the Lord&apos;s day...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">John testified that he was caught away in the Spirit andtransported through time down to the coming of the Lord -- &quot;<i>The Lord&#39;s Day.</i>&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 4: 1&#44; 2 &quot;After this I looked&#44; and&#44; behold&#44; a door was opened inheaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talkingwith me; which said&#44; Come up hither&#44; and I will show thee things which must behereafter. And immediately I was in the Spirit: and&#44; behold&#44; a throne was setin heaven&#44; and One sat on the throne.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">John was not only transported through time&#44; but also throughspace.</span></p><p><span lang="en">It was in Heaven</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;And there appeared a great wonder in <b>heaven</b>...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">It appeared&#44; or was revealed to John&#44; in the heavenlyrealm. Paul also declared that he had such an experience himself.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">II Cor. 12: 2--4 &quot;I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago&#44; (whetherin the body&#44; I cannot tell; or whether out of the body&#44; I cannot tell: Godknoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. And I knew such a man&#44;(whether in the body&#44; or out of the body&#44; I cannot tell: God knoweth;) Howthat he was caught up into paradise&#44; and heard unspeakable words&#44; which it isnot lawful for a man to utter.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">It was Spiritual</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...A great wonder in <b>heaven</b>...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">It was totally and completely apart from the natural realm. It was of a heavenly order not only given in the Spirit&#44; but was of a spiritualsignificance. If you miss this&#44; you may miss the true interpretation of thisverse.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 1: 3 &quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&#44; whohath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">The Exposition of This Revelation</span></h2><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...A woman clothed with the sun&#44; and the moon under her feet and upon herhead a crown of twelve stars:&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">&quot;A Woman&quot; -- A mystery woman</span></p><p><span lang="en">Who is this Woman? Before explaining who this Woman is&#44; itis necessary to explain who she is not.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Who the Woman is Not</span></p><h4><span lang="en">She is Not Mary</span></h4><p><span lang="en">Mary was a peasant woman of a very lowly condition who hadpassed away long before this prophecy -- yet this Woman continues into theTribulation for three-and-a-half years.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 6 &quot;And the woman fled into the wilderness&#44; (Tribulation) whereshe hath a place prepared of God&#44; that they should feed her there a thousandtwo hundred and threescore days (three-and-a-half years).&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Furthermore&#44; Jesus <b>
<u>came down</u></b>from heaven at His birth; the &quot;Man-Child&quot; is <b>
<u>caught up</u></b>to God and to His throne shortly after his birth. When Christ &quot;
<u>anabaino
</u>&quot;--&quot;
<u>ascended
</u>&quot;up into heaven&#44; this Revelation had not yet been written. It was said at thetime of the writing of this Revelation that this is a book of prophecy and thatit refers to things still in the future. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 1: 1&#44; 3 &quot;...Things which <b>
<u>must shortly come</u></b><b>
<u>to pass</u></b>... Blessed is he that readeth&#44; and they thathear the words of this prophecy...&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 4: 1 &quot;...I will show thee things which must be hereafter.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 22: 18 &quot;For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the <b>
<u>prophecy</u></b>of this book...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Moreover&#44; Jesus &quot;
<u>ascended
</u>&quot; (anabaino) up intoheaven. Whereas it was said of the &quot;Man-Child&quot; that he was &quot;
<u>caught up
</u>&quot;(harpazo -- to snatch or catch away). It was also said of Philip&#44; that he was &quot;
<u>caught away
</u>&quot; by the Spirit of the Lord in Acts 8: 39. Again&#44; it was said ofthe Apostle Paul&#44; he was &quot;
<u>caught up
</u>&quot; to paradise. (II Cor. 12:2--4) </span></p><p><span lang="en">&quot;Harpazo&quot; -- &quot;caught up&quot; -- To seize -- pull -- catch away --take by force -- stemming from a root word&#44; to prefer -- choose -- to take foroneself</span></p><p><span lang="en">This verb &quot;harpazo&quot; conveys the idea of 
<u>force suddenly exercised
</u>&#44; as in Matt. 11: 12 &quot;<i>...take it by force.</i>&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">Therefore&#44; if John had wanted us to understand that this wasJesus being caught up&#44; I am sure he would have said that the Lord Jesus wascaught up (snatched -- seized) to the throne. What advantage would it have beento John not to have said so? Jesus ascended of His own power&#44; while theMan-Child will be caught up by the power of the Holy Spirit.</span></p><h4><span lang="en">She is Not Jerusalem</span></h4><p><span lang="en">Some believe that this Woman is the city of Jerusalem. It has been said that there are only two women spoken of in the book ofRevelation. The one is Babylon&#44; &quot;<i>that great city which reigneth over thekings of the earth.</i>&quot; (Rev. 17: 18) The other is the city <i>&quot;...whichspiritually is called Sodom and Egypt&#44; where also our Lord was crucified.&quot;</i>(Rev. 11: 8)</span></p><p><span lang="en">It is strange that John would refer to Jerusalem in theeleventh chapter as &quot;<i>Sodom</i><i> and Egypt&#44;</i>&quot; and then in the twelfthchapter say that she is &quot;<i>clothed with the Sun and the Moon under her feet.</i>&quot; It is also contrary to the nature of things for a material city to take wingsof an eagle and fly into the wilderness for three-and-a-half years&#44; and then&#44;after the stay in the wilderness&#44; to be caught away.</span></p><h4><span lang="en">She is Not Israel</span></h4><p><span lang="en">Another school of thought&#44; and a more prominent teachingtoday&#44; is the belief that she is literal Israel. Dr. James Gray says&#44; &quot;TheWoman represents Israel&#44; it is believed.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">Believed by whom? It is believed by most&#44; if not all Pre-Tribulationrapturists&#44; because their teaching about the 
<u>time
</u> of the rapturerequires it. Since their reasoning is that the Church is to be raptured beforethe Tribulation&#44; she cannot represent the Church&#44; so she must represent Israel.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Dr. Schofield is of the same opinion -- &quot;The Woman: Israel.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">Many say she must be Israel because of what the prophetIsaiah said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Isa. 66: 7 &quot;Before she travailed&#44; she brought forth; before her pain came&#44;she was delivered of a man child.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Look very carefully at the two prophecies -- this one inIsaiah is different from the one that is stated in Rev. 12: 2&#44; which states &quot;...<i>travailing in birth&#44; and pained to be delivered.</i>&quot; The one says a Woman is in paintravailing to bring forth a Man-Child&#44; and the other says that before she travailed she brought forth. Before her pain came&#44; she was delivered. So then&#44; they arenot the same experience.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Israel as a nation was unaware of it producing the Christ&#44;the &quot;Man-Child&quot; of Isa. 66: 7. The Woman in Revelation cried&#44; travailing inbirth and pained to be delivered of a &quot;Man-Child.&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">The first thing to understand concerning the nation of Israel is that Israel was an earthly heritage. </span></p><p><span lang="en">An earthly people -- an earthly kingdom -- earthly possessions</span></p><p><span lang="en">The only mention of Israel and the heavens is Abraham&#39;s seedbeing as the stars of the sky&#44; and then only of those that are spiritual --believers.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rom. 9: 6--8 &quot;Not as though the Word of God hath taken none effect. Forthey are not all Israel&#44; which are of Israel: Neither&#44; because they are theseed of Abraham&#44; are they all children: but&#44; in <b>Isaac shall thy seed be called</b>. That is&#44; They which are the children of the flesh&#44; these are notthe children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Also&#44; look at the nation of Israel in her spiritualcondition as pictured in the Scripture. Israel as a nation is pictured in thebook of Hosea as an unfaithful wife and a harlot on the streets. As you lookat Israel today&#44; you can see that this is her condition rather than that of aplace of honor.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Here in Revelation a Woman is pictured as &quot;<i>clothed withthe sun</i>&#44;&quot; producing a &quot;Man--Child&quot; which was caught up to God and to Histhrone.</span></p><h4><span lang="en">She is Not the World Church</span></h4><p><span lang="en">There are others that believe this Woman is the worldchurch&#44; or the church universal. A good look at the condition of the churchuniversal will reveal that she is not arrayed in this fashion; but is worldly&#44;unholy&#44; ungodly and devilish. How can an unholy thing produce such a holything that is preferred&#44; chosen&#44; and caught up to God and to His throne?</span></p><p><span lang="en">The only thing that the world church will produce andsupport is the anti-christ.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Who the Woman Is</span></p><p><span lang="en">Let us go back into the first chapter of Revelation and seeif we can find something to help&#44; not only in the interpretation of this verseof Scripture&#44; but for all of the revelation itself. I believe there are somekeys to help us understand who this Woman is.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 1: 3 &quot;Blessed is he that readeth&#44; and they that hear the words ofthis prophecy...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This &quot;<i>prophecy</i>&quot; has to do with prophetic utterance;foretelling something that is yet to come to pass.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 1: 1 &quot;...Things which must shortly come to pass...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This means these things have not yet come to pass. This isnot a record of history; this is a Book of Prophecy. Again in Rev. 4: 1&#44; &quot;<i>...andI will show thee things which must be hereafter.</i>&quot;</span></p><p><span lang="en">I believe that God gave me a key&#44; and I believe that key canhelp us understand the mystery of this &quot;Woman.&quot; I have noticed in my studiesof the Book of Revelation&#44; that wherever there is a question in John&#39;s mind ofanyone 
<u>not grasping
</u> what is to be understood&#44; he goes on anddeclares to us what should be understood. Take for example the mystery of theseven stars and the seven golden candlesticks.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 1: 20 &quot;...The seven stars are the angels (messengers) of the sevenchurches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Again&#44; here in the twelfth chapter John speaks of the &quot;<i>GreatRed Dragon</i>&quot; with seven heads and ten horns&#44; and seven crowns upon hisheads. He then tells us who the dragon is in verse 9&#44; &quot;<i>satan</i>.&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 9 &quot;And the great dragon was cast out&#44; that old serpent&#44; calledthe devil&#44; and satan&#44; which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into theearth&#44; and his angels were cast out with him.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">He speaks of the harlot church that is riding upon the Beastin Rev. 17&#44; and then he makes it very plain that this is Mystery Babylon&#44; theharlot religious system that has existed throughout all ages. He speaks of Israel&#44; and every time he speaks concerning these things in a figurative manner&#44; he thengoes on and explains to us the meaning. So now&#44; when we come to Rev. 12&#44; ifyou use the key that I am sure the Holy Spirit put here&#44; it will help you tosee the truth.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Rev. 1: 4 says&#44; &quot;<i>John 
<u>to the Seven Churches
</u>...</i>&quot; Who is John writing to? Does he leave us to interpret who he is writing to? Has not the Holy Spirit been very precise in putting these things in theScripture to help us understand who John is writing to? &quot;<i>John to the SevenChurches...</i>&quot; that is the Seven Church Ages or the whole of the Church Age.</span></p><p><span lang="en">One might ask&#44; what age of the Church are we in today? TheScripture makes it quite plain that we are in the Laodician Age. What is theLaodician Age? It is the last age of the Church. Notice&#44; if John&#44; by the HolySpirit&#44; has in other places made it plain that we are to understand certainthings&#44; then where there is an absence of explanation&#44; we should understandthat he is writing to the Church or about the Church. This &quot;
<u>Sun
</u>-
<u>Clothed Woman
</u>&quot; referred to in chapter twelve is the Church. You will find thatin this Book of Revelation&#44; the Church is one of the most prominent subjectsother than Christ&#44; who the Revelation is of.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Now going back into Rev. 12: 1&#44; in the first part of theverse you see this &quot;<i>&hellip;<b>great</b> wonder in <b>heaven</b>&hellip;</i>&quot;  What is thescriptural position of the Church today? In Eph. 2: 6 Paul says&#44; &quot;<i>...Hathraised us up together...</i>&quot; that is&#44; He hath raised us up out of sin&#44; &quot;<i>...andmade us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:</i>&quot; He hath raisedus up together&#44; hath quickened us&#44; hath given us life&#44; brought us out of death&#44;and raised us up into heavenly places&#44; in Christ Jesus. He has made us sittogether in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. This is where John said he sawthis &quot;Woman&quot; in heaven.</span></p><p><span lang="en">This is a Revelation of Christ and the Church. &quot;...<i>Agreat wonder </i>(mystery)<i> in heaven...</i>&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 5: 32 &quot;This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and theChurch.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Church is the Body of Christ&#44; of which Christ is theHead.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 1: 22&#44; 23 &quot;And hath put all things under His feet&#44; and gave Him to bethe head over all things to the Church. Which is His body&#44; the fullness of Himthat filleth all in all.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 5: 23 &quot;For the husband is the head of the wife&#44; even as Christ is theHead of the Church...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Woman&#39;s Apparel and Position</span></p><h4><span lang="en">&quot;Clothed with the Sun&quot;</span></h4><p><span lang="en">Christ is &quot;<i>The Sun of Righteousness</i>.&quot; (Mal. 4: 2)</span></p><p><span lang="en">Light is the symbol of Christ&#39;s Divine Nature. In Jn. 8: 12Jesus said&#44; &quot;<i>I am the light of the world:</i>&quot; The Church is clothed withthe light and the glory of the Son of God. To be &quot;<i>clothed with the sun</i>&quot;means to be clothed with the imputed righteousness of Christ.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rom. 13: 12 &quot;The night is far spent&#44; the day is at hand: let us thereforecast off the works of darkness&#44; and let us put on the armour of light.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rom. 13: 14 &quot;But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ&#44; and make not provisionfor the flesh&#44; to fulfil the lusts thereof.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Gal. 3: 27 &quot;For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have puton Christ.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">II Pet. 1: 4 &quot;Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and preciouspromises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Pay particular attention that the Scripture does not saythat the &quot;<i>woman</i>&quot; embodied the &quot;<i>sun.</i>&quot; It says&#44; &quot;<i>The woman wasclothed with the sun.</i>&quot; There is a vast difference in having Christ&#39;srighteousness accredited <b>
<u>to</u></b> your account (imputed to you) andhaving it imparted <b>
<u>in</u></b> you&#44; which is Christ&#39;s righteousnessrevealed in you by righteous acts -- righteous living. So then&#44; He is nottalking about a perfected Church; He is talking only about the possibility ofperfection.</span></p><p><span lang="en">John does not see the &quot;Woman&quot; (the Church) in a perfectedstate. He sees her in a position where she has the potential of entering aperfected state&#44; which she will enter during the first three-and-a-half years ofthe Tribulation.</span></p><h4><span lang="en">&quot;The Moon Under her Feet&quot;</span></h4><p><span lang="en">The first thing we liken the moon to is the Law. The sun isthe light that rules the day and the moon is the ruling light of the night. The moon is a reflection of the light of the sun. Likewise&#44; the Law is areflection of things to come. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Gal. 3: 24 &quot;...The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ...&quot; </span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...Clothed with the Sun&#44; and the Moon under her feet...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Church has been elevated by grace in Christ where God issatisfied and the Law is satisfied.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rom. 8: 2--4 &quot;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath mademe free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do&#44; in that it was weak through the flesh&#44; God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh&#44; and for sin&#44; condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us&#44; who walk not after the flesh&#44; but after the Spirit.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">If 
<u>grace
</u> has not elevated you so that the Law issatisfied (i.e. under your feet)&#44; then you are still under the Law. <b>
<u>Grace does not allow you to live in sin
</u>.</b> To believe otherwise is a perversion of 
<u>grace
</u>.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Jude 4 &quot;For there are certain men crept in unawares&#44; who were before ofold ordained to this condemnation&#44; ungodly men&#44; turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness (without restraint)&#44; and denying the only Lord God&#44; and ourLord Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Grace&#44; as an enablement&#44; works in us through Christ to thesatisfying of the Law. We are elevated by grace to a position where the Law isunder our feet.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The second thing we liken the moon to is &quot;Lucifer.&quot; Theguiding light that shines in the day represents Jesus&#44; and there is a light inthe night that represents Lucifer. &quot;Lucifer&quot; means brightness -- light bearer. The 
<u>night
</u> represents darkness&#44; and darkness represents the powers of 
<u>evil
</u>. &quot;Lucifer&quot; fell&#44; perverting the light that he was given. The Scripture saysthat satan comes &quot;<i>...as an angel of light...</i>&quot; He is not an angel of light&#44;he comes &quot;<i>&hellip; <b>
<u>as</u></b> an angel of light...</i>&quot; The <i>&quot;moon&quot;</i>has no real light of its own.</span></p><p><span lang="en">John said he saw this &quot;<i>woman clothed with the sun&quot; </i>exaltedin the heavenlies -- into this high spiritual position.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...Clothed with the Sun and the Moon under her feet...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Therefore&#44; this is not only a type of the Law&#44; but alsoindicates the powers of darkness. The devil had the power of death&#44; which camethrough the broken Law. The devil still holds this power over the unsaved.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 2: 14&#44; 15 &quot;...Himself likewise took part of the same; that throughdeath He might destroy him that had the power of death&#44; that is&#44; the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject tobondage.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Christ has put the powers of darkness&#44; and the Law (brokenLaw) which gives darkness its power&#44; under the feet of the Church. The devilwould have no power if the Law had not been broken.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 2: 8 &quot;Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Wherefore&#44; satan cannot rule over the believer. Remember&#44; &quot;<i>...greateris He that is in you&#44; than he that is in the world.</i>&quot; (I Jn. 4: 4) Thebeliever is in a position of authority. The true children of God are the devil&#39;s master and are no longer his servants. They can put him in his rightful place under their feet and can stand in their position over the powers of darkness.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Jesus said&#44; <i>&quot;...I will build My Church...&quot;</i>and this iswhat He is doing today -- building His Church. This real&#44; true Church has been militant&#44; successful and spiritually prosperous.

Christ has entered into His reward. He is in the place ofauthority and has entered into His reward -- He has been crowned! The numbertwelve has to do with governmental perfection -- Christ is the Head of thisheavenly government.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Some believe the stars in the crown are the twelveapostles. Scripture&#44; however&#44; refers to them as part of the foundation.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 2: 19&#44; 20 &quot;Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners&#44; butfellowcitizens with the saints&#44; and of the household of God; And are builtupon the <b>

Foundation stones are much different from stars on a crown. When you thinkabout a crown&#44; you think about royalty. Somebody was crowned. Therefore&#44;there must be a kingdom. When you have a kingdom&#44; you have rule&#44; authority andgovernment. Furthermore&#44; a crown speaks of reward. Christ&#44; being the head ofthe Church&#44; has both been crowned and has entered into His reward. The &quot;<i>...crownof twelve stars...</i>&quot; then has to do with the office&#44; the function and thereward of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 5: 8&#44; 9 &quot;Though He were a Son&#44; yet learned He obedience by the thingswhich He suffered; And being made perfect&#44; He became the Author of eternalsalvation unto all them that obey Him;&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This refers to Christ&#39;s earthly life.

<u>does
</u>give them

In order to be a part of the &quot;Man-Child&quot;(the Bride) there must be a complete dedication to the Lord and since resubmission to the Holy Spirit to sanctify and to cleanse &quot;<i>...from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit&#44; perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</i>&quot; (II Cor. 7: 1)</span></p><p><span lang="en">God has sent the Holy Spirit to get a Bride. He has giventhe Holy Spirit the responsibility of perfecting the Bride. The Holy Spirit isdoing the work of perfection in the hearts of those who will yield to Him. I believe we have this in type in the life of Mary bringing Christ into the worldby the Holy Ghost. So likewise God&#44; by the Holy Ghost&#44; is going to overshadow the Church in the end-time&#44; and He is going to bring forth a Holy Child -- &quot;The Man-Child.&quot;</span></p>
