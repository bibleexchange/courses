However&#44; there are many objections to this theory.</span></p><h4><span lang="en">Translation is Not Ascension</span></h4><p><span lang="en">This is part of a vision that was given to the Apostle John some sixty years after the ascension of Christ. The entire vision is arevelation of things that were to &quot;<i>come to pass</i>&quot; after it was given. How then can the translation of this &quot;Man-Child&quot; refer to the ascension ofChrist&#44; which occurred some sixty years before this vision?</span></p><h4><span lang="en">Descending is Not Ascending</span></h4><p><span lang="en">At Christ&#39;s birth He came down from heaven. The &quot;Man-Child&quot;was birthed and caught up to heaven&#44; and to God&#39;s Throne.</span></p><h4><span lang="en">New-Born is Not Full Grown</span></h4><p><span lang="en">If this Scripture refers to the ascension of Christ&#44; how can the figure of a new-born child&#44; which the devil could not kill (&quot;<i>caught upunto God&#44; and to His throne</i>&quot;) be used to symbolize the ascension of afull-grown man&#44; who the devil did have a part in bringing about His death? Christ was killed&#44; the Scripture says&#44; &quot;<i>By wicked hands...crucified and slain&#44;</i>&quot;(put to death&#44; the death of the Cross). True&#44; He surrendered His life&#44; but Hedied. The &quot;Man-Child&quot; is not harmed by the devil&#44; but was caught up to God andto His throne.</span></p><h4><span lang="en">Prophecy is Not History</span></h4><p><span lang="en">Christ had already returned to heaven when this Prophecy was given. The Revelation was written about 96 A.D.&#44; some sixty years after Christdied&#44; arose and ascended to heaven. In Rev. 4: 1 following His messages to theseven Churches&#44; He said<i>&#44; &quot;Come-up hither&#44; and I will show thee things whichmust be hereafter.&quot;</i>This is not a Book of <b>
<u>History</u></b>&#44; but aBook of <b>
<u>Prophecy</u></b>. So then&#44; out of the Laodicean Age (the lastage) of the Church&#44; the &quot;Man-Child&quot; is birthed. The &quot;Woman&quot; travails and criesin pain and agony&#44; that the &quot;<i>Child</i>&quot; may be brought to birth andmanifested as the &quot;Sons&quot; (Huios) of God. These are men and women filled withthe highest qualities of virtue&#44; courage&#44; self-denial and strength from God. These are the &quot;Overcomers;&quot; they are &quot;<i>more than conquerors.</i>&quot; They haveovercome the world&#44; they have conquered their flesh&#44; and they have triumphedover the powers of darkness.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Believed to be Christ Produced by the Church</span></p><p><span lang="en">It is believed that this is the Church producing Christ. The &quot;Man-Child&quot; is a product of the Woman. The Woman (the Church) was birthedon the Day of Pentecost after the death&#44; burial and resurrection of Christ. The Woman is in travail to bring forth the &quot;Man-Child.&quot;  It seems to me that itwould be very difficult for the Church&#44; which did not yet exist until after theResurrection&#44; to produce the Christ. Furthermore&#44; Christ said He was going tobuild His Church. This being true&#44; how could the Church produce the Christthat built her?</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 16: 18 &quot;And I say also unto thee&#44; That thou art Peter&#44; and upon thisrock I will build My church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail againstit.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">The Revealing of the &quot;Man-Child&quot;</span></h2><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 5 &quot;...And she brought forth...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Definition of the Revealing</span></p><p><span lang="en">To bring forth is to reveal -- to bring to the light -- the making visible of that which was invisible -- a revealing or manifestation ofthat which was birthed</span></p><p><span lang="en">Scripture speaks of &quot;...the Manifestation of the sons ofGod.&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rom. 8: 17--19 &quot;And if children&#44; then heirs; heirs of God&#44; and joint-heirswith Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him&#44; that we may be also glorifiedtogether.
