<h1><span lang="en">The Woman in the Wilderness</span></h1>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 6 &quot;And the woman fled into the wilderness&#44; where she hath a placeprepared of God&#44; that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred andthreescore days...&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 13--16 &quot;And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth&#44;he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the womanwere given two wings of a great eagle&#44; that she might fly into the wilderness&#44;into her place&#44; where she is nourished for a time&#44; and times&#44; and half a time&#44;from the face of the serpent. And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as aflood after the woman&#44; that he might cause her to be carried away of theflood. And the earth helped the woman&#44; and the earth opened her mouth&#44; andswallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The dragon being banished from heaven by the Man-Child&#44; withthe aid and assistance of Michael and his angels&#44; now turns his wrath and venomon the Woman.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 12&#44; 13 &quot;...Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! forthe devil is come down unto you&#44; having great wrath&#44; because he knoweth that hehath but a short time. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto theearth&#44; he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">We have already established the identity of the Woman in thechapter dealing with the &quot;Sun-Clothed Woman&quot; and her giving birth to the&quot;Man-Child&#44;&quot; which was the cause of the devil&#39;s expulsion from heaven. TheWoman (the mother of the &quot;Man-Child&quot;) is the Church that is left here on earthwhen the &quot;Man-Child&quot; (the Bride of Christ; the Overcomer) is caught up to Godand to His Throne. The reason the Woman (the Church) is left is because shedid not make herself ready.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 7&#44; 8 &quot;Let us be glad and rejoice&#44; and give honour to Him: for themarriage of the Lamb is come&#44; and His wife hath made herself <b> <u>ready</u></b>. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen&#44; clean andwhite: for the fine linen is the righteousness (righteous acts) of saints.&quot;(Acquired righteousness)</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Church did not watch and pray&#44; as she was admonished byher Lord.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 21: 36 &quot;Watch ye therefore&#44; and pray always&#44; that ye may be accountedworthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass&#44; and to stand beforethe Son of man.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Agrupneo&quot; -- &quot;Watch&quot; -- sleepless -- keep awake</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 5 &quot;While the Bridegroom tarried&#44; they all slumbered and slept.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Thes. 5: 6 &quot;Therefore let us not sleep&#44; as do others; but let us watchand be sober.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Those that slumbered and slept were all virgins&#44; five ofwhich had oil (a type of the Holy Spirit). These five virgins with oil hadgone to sleep&#44; representing the Church that will go out to meet the Bridegroom&#44;when He comes with His Bride. They will be guests at the Wedding Feast.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 10 &quot;And those who were prepared went in with Himto the marriage feast:&quot; (Amplified N.T.)</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 12: 35--38 &quot;Let your loins be girded about&#44; and your lights burning;(to have lights burning you must have oil&#44; and the admonition is to <u>gird up</u>. That is&#44; they had truth but they were slack. He admonishes them to gird up the loins. Eph. 6: 14 &quot;...Girt about with truth...&quot;) And ye yourselves like unto men <u>that wait for their Lord</u> &#44; when He will <u>return</u> (not come for the wedding&#44; <u>but return</u> ) from the wedding; that when He cometh and knocketh&#44; they may open unto Him immediately. <u>Blessed</u> are those servants&#44; whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you&#44; that He shall gird Himself&#44; and make them to sit down to meat&#44; and will come forth and serve them. (The WeddingFeast) And if He shall come in the second watch&#44; or come in the third watch&#44;and find them so&#44; blessed are those servants.&quot; (The Church)</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The First Watch has already taken place. The Bride ofChrist has made herself ready and she was taken in the First Watch. Jesus usedthe words&#44; &quot;...<i>If He shall come in the second watch&#44; or come in the thirdwatch...</i>&quot; which point to the Midnight hour.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 6 &quot;And at midnight there was a cry made&#44; Behold&#44; the Bridegroomcometh;&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">At midnight -- in the middle of the Tribulation -- He willcome back for the Church. The Church is not ready for rapture; she isLaodicean. It will take the first three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation toawaken the Church and get her ready to meet the Lord when He returns from theWedding.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">In Rev. 19: after the Bride has made herself ready and has become the Lamb&#39;s wife&#44; the Scripture says in vs. 9<i>&#44; &quot;...Write&#44; <u>Blessed</u> are they which are called unto <u>the marriage supper </u> of theLamb...&quot;</i>The Church is not the Bride as she was not &quot;<i>...found worthy</i>.&quot; In fact&#44; Jesus said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 16&#44; 17 &quot;So then because thou art lukewarm&#44; and neither cold norhot&#44; I will spue thee out of My mouth. Because thou sayest&#44; I am rich&#44; andincreased with goods&#44; and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou artwretched&#44; and miserable&#44; and poor&#44; and blind&#44; and naked:&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Again&#44; it will take the first three-and-a-half years ofTribulation and persecution to bring the Church to the place where she will beready to meet her Lord in the air.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Thes. 4: 16&#44; 17 &quot;For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with ashout&#44; with the voice of the archangel&#44; and with the trump of God: and the deadin Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caughtup together with them in the clouds&#44; to meet the Lord in the air: and so shallwe ever be with the Lord.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Church will be called to the Marriage Supper of theLamb. This is not the <u>Wedding </u>&#44; but to the <u>Marriage Supper </u>.</span></p>
<h2><span lang="en"> The Wilderness</span></h2>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 6 &quot;And the womanfled into the wilderness...&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">A Condition of Desolation</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Eremos&quot; -- &quot;Wilderness&quot; -- desolate -- deserted -- lonely</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Eremos&quot; is an adjective describing a condition rather thanindicating a place.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Pheugo&quot; -- &quot;Fled&quot; --to run away -- as a fugitive -- <u>escaped </u> </span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Woman runs away from the attacks of the dragon. Thereis only one place to run for safety&#44; and that is to the Cross of the Lord JesusChrist&#44; where the blood protects from all the attacks of the dragon. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Jesus said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 24: 8&#44; 9 &quot;All these are the beginning of sorrows (Tribulation). Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted&#44; and shall kill you: and yeshall be hated of all nations for My name&apos;s sake.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">In the Gospel according to Luke&#44; Jesus said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 21: 12 &quot;But before allthese&#44; they shall lay their hands on you&#44; and <u>persecute </u> you&#44; deliveringyou up to the synagogues&#44; and into prisons&#44; being brought before kings andrulers for My name&apos;s sake.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">A Time of Refining</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Church is going to be refined and made ready throughpersecution. She will be driven back to a separated life; separated from theworld and all its worldly attractions.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">II Cor. 6: 17&#44; 18 &quot;Wherefore come out from among them&#44; and be ye separate&#44;saith the Lord&#44; and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you&#44; Andwill be a Father unto you&#44; and ye shall be My sons and daughters&#44; saith theLord Almighty.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Jn. 2: 15--17 &quot;Love not the world&#44; neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world&#44; the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world&#44; the lust of the flesh&#44; and the lust of the eyes&#44; and the pride of life&#44; is not of the Father&#44; but is of the world. And the world passeth away&#44; and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<h2><span lang="en">A Place Prepared</span></h2>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 6 &quot;...Where she hath a place prepared of God...&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Topos&quot; -- &quot;Place&quot; -- a place which a person or thing occupies-- metaphorically&#44; of condition -- occasion -- opportunity -- <u>position </u></span></p>
<p><span lang="en">It will take the persecution to drive the Church <b><u>back to the place</u> </b> where she belongs. The Scripture says&#44; &quot;<i>...A place prepared of God...</i>&quot;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Hetoimazo&quot; -- &quot;Prepared&quot; -- it has the meaning of make ready</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">God is bringing the Church into a real experience&#44; not oneof having just a form.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">II Tim. 3: 5 &quot;Having a form of godliness&#44; but denying the power thereof:from such turn away.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">God has a place that has been prepared from the foundationof the World. Christ was as a <i>&quot;...Lamb slain from the foundation of theworld.</i>&quot;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">A Place of Discipline</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Church refused to be disciplined; but now she will learndiscipline. She will learn to deny <u>self </u>&#44; take up her cross and followHim. The Church will learn through discipline to surrender its own will&#44; andto follow the Lamb wherever He goes. Sheep that refused to follow had one oftheir legs broken&#44; so it learned to follow the Shepherd. Likewise&#44; the Churchwill have its leg broken&#44; as it were&#44; through persecution to learn to follow.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">A Place of Learning</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Church will learn to take the Lord&#39;s yoke upon them&#44; andlearn of Him. They will learn the Word in a way that they had never known&#44; orever even felt the need to know. They will learn to know His <b><u>Will</u></b>in a way that they had never before seen necessary. They will learn His <b> <u>Ways</u></b>without rebelling and become willing to obey. They will learn His <b> <u>Commands</u></b>&#44;that they had never before desired to know. They will learn His <b> <u>Judgments</u></b>in a way that they do not have a right to decide to receive or reject&#44; but mustaccept them as His decision and not theirs. His slightest wish will becometheir supreme command.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">A Place of Testing</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">No one will ever make heaven without being tested. Petersaid:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Pet. 1: 7 &quot;...The trial of your faith&#44; being much more precious than ofgold that perisheth&#44; though it be tried with fire&#44; might be found unto praiseand honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:&quot; </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Again Peter said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Pet. 4: 12&#44; 13 &quot;Beloved&#44; think it not strange concerning the fiery trialwhich is to try you&#44; as though some strange thing happened unto you: Butrejoice&#44; inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ&apos;s sufferings; that&#44; when Hisglory shall be revealed&#44; ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Paul said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rom. 8: 17 &quot;...If so be that we suffer with Him&#44; that we may be alsoglorified together.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">II Tim. 2: 12 &quot;If we suffer&#44; we shall also reign with Him: if we deny Him&#44;He also will deny us:&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 12: 6--8 &quot;For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth&#44; and scourgeth everyson whom He receiveth. If ye endure chastening&#44; God dealeth with you as withsons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be withoutchastisement&#44; whereof all are partakers&#44; then are ye (illegitimate)&#44; and notsons.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Heb. 12: 8 Amplified N.T. &quot;Now if you are exempt fromcorrection and left without discipline in which <u>all </u> (of God&#39;s children)share&#44; then you are illegitimate offspring and not the true sons (at all).&quot;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Because the Church refused to be tested and tried beforeTribulation&#44; in the hour of persecution they will be tested and learn to knowthe value of testing during the first three-and-a-half years of theTribulation.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Psalm 110: 3 &quot;Thy people shall be willing in the day of Thy power...&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Isa. 26: 9 &quot;...For when Thy judgments are in the earth&#44; the inhabitants ofthe world will learn righteousness.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">What the Church could have learned through the preaching ofthe Word before Tribulation&#44; they will learn through persecution. They refusedto listen to the preached Word&#44; but they will listen through persecution. TheChurch today is in the state that Paul wrote about&#44; to young Timothy:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">II Tim. 4: 3&#44; 4 &quot;For the time will come (and the time has come) when theywill not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap tothemselves teachers&#44; having itching ears; And they shall turn away their earsfrom the truth&#44; and shall be turned unto fables.&quot; </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Muthos&quot; -- &quot;Fables&quot; --myth -- fiction -- a falsification offacts</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Church today does not want the truth. Their mindset is&#44;&quot;Tell us stories&#44; myths -- fictions -- that which is false&#44; but do not tell usthe truth.&quot; However&#44; the time will come after the Bride (the Overcomer) hasbeen translated&#44; and persecution comes that the Church will long and cry outfor the purity of the Word. When the Church cries out for the Word and a rightrelationship with God&#44; God will hear and do as Peter said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Pet. 5: 10 &quot;But the God of all grace&#44; who hath called us unto Hiseternal glory by Christ Jesus&#44; after that ye have suffered a while&#44; make youperfect&#44; stablish&#44; strengthen&#44; settle you.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Church will be revived and prepared for Rapture in themiddle of the Tribulation hour. This will be the fulfilling of Joel&#39;sprophecy&#44; both to the nation of Israel (the Jews)&#44; and to the Church.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Joel 2: 28&#44; 29 &quot;And it shall come to pass afterward&#44; that I will pour outMy spirit upon <u>all flesh </u>; and your sons and your daughters shallprophesy&#44; your old men shall dream dreams&#44; your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour outMy spirit.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">This is not the earnest of the Spirit&#44; but rather thefullness of the Spirit. It does not say &quot;<i>...I will pour <b> <u>out of</u></b>...</i>&quot;as stated in Acts 2: 17 but &quot;<i>...I will pour <b> <u>out</u></b> My Spirit.</i>&quot; There is a difference in &quot;<i>pouring out <b> <u>of</u></b></i>&quot; and &quot;<i>pouringout</i>.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">When God brought Israel out of Egypt&#44; He tested them beforeHe brought them into the Promised Land.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Duet. 8: 2&#44; 3 &quot;...Thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God ledthee these forty years in the wilderness&#44; to humble thee&#44; and to prove thee&#44; toknow what was in thine heart&#44; whether thou wouldest keep His commandments&#44; orno. And He humbled thee&#44; and suffered thee to hunger&#44; and fed thee with manna&#44;which thou knewest not&#44; neither did thy fathers know; that He might make theeknow that man doth not live by bread only&#44; but by every Word that proceedeth outof the mouth of the LORD doth man live.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Church has to learn this lesson&#44; as well as Israel&#44; before they pass into the Promise Land; that &quot;<i>man </i>(shall)<i> not live bybread only&#44; but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord...</i>&quot; The Church must be put to the test and be proven that she will serve and loveher Lord with all her heart&#44; and all her soul&#44; and all her mind.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 10 &quot;...The hour of temptation (trial -- testing -- putting to proof --scrutinize -- discipline -- examine)&#44; which shall come upon all the world&#44; to trythem that dwell upon the earth.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">A Place of Persecution</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 13 &quot;And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth&#44; hepersecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 12 &quot;...Having great wrath...&quot; </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Thumos&quot; -- &quot;Wrath&quot; -- hot anger -- passion -- as if breathinghard -- fierceness -- indignation -- an agitated condition of the feelings -- anoutburst of wrath</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The dragon takes out his wrath on the Woman (the Church)because of the position that he has lost. The &quot;Man-Child&quot; has taken thedragon&#39;s place since the dragon has been cast out unto the earth&#44; therefore hepersecutes the Woman. The reason he attacks the Woman is because she broughtforth the &quot;Man-Child&quot; that resulted in his being cast out.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Another reason&#44; which the Scripture makes very plain&#44; isthat the dragon rages &quot;<i>...because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</i>&quot; (Rev. 12: 12) This is a period of three-and-a-half years before the Woman isprepared and made ready for rapture. The dragon will do all that he can tokeep the Church from pleasing God; but the more he attacks and persecutes&#44; themore the Church is refined&#44; purified and driven to God.</span></p>

<h4><span lang="en">The Woman Finds Her Place</span></h4>
<blockquote><span lang="en">&quot;...That she might fly into the wilderness&#44; into her place...&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">It is here in the wilderness (desolate -- deserted -- lonely)that she finds her place.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Church has been <u>out of her place </u>for a long time. Jesus said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 14--18 &quot;And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;These things saith the Amen&#44; the faithful and true witness&#44; the beginning ofthe creation of God; I know thy works&#44; that thou art neither cold nor hot: Iwould thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm&#44; and neithercold nor hot&#44; I will spue thee out of My mouth. Because thou sayest&#44; I amrich&#44; and increased with goods&#44; and have need of nothing; and knowest not thatthou art wretched&#44; and miserable&#44; and poor&#44; and blind&#44; and naked: I counselthee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire (the Church refuses to buy now&#44; butthe Church will buy and pay a great price in the Tribulation Hour)&#44; that thoumayest be rich; and white raiment&#44; that thou mayest be clothed&#44; and that theshame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve&#44; thatthou mayest see.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">A Place of Nourishing</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 14 &quot;...Where she (the Church) is nourished...&quot;</span></blockquote>
<h4><span lang="en">A Supernatural Feeding</span></h4>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Trepho&quot; -- &quot;Nourished&quot; -- to make to grow -- feed -- bring up --to bring to maturity</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The idea is that of a supernatural feeding. Israel hadmanna supplied miraculously to them in the wilderness to get them ready toenter into Canaan. Most commentators and expositors depict this as a naturalplace where the Woman flees from the attacks of the dragon&#44; and God simplygives her physical food&#44; as He did Israel in the wilderness. This is so farfrom the truth of what is being related through the Apostle John to the Church.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Remember&#44; this is a vision of a &quot;Woman&quot; in Heaven (in thespiritual realm). Understanding this as nothing more than a natural occurrenceis to do injustice to the context and purpose of the vision.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Things happen to Israel as the Apostle Paul writes:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 10: 11 &quot;Now all these things happened unto them (Israel) forensamples: and they are written for our admonition&#44; upon whom the ends of theworld are come.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">God gave Israel physical manna&#44; but He is going to give theChurch spiritual manna (Divine Revelation).</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 20 &quot;Behold&#44; I stand at the door&#44; and knock: if any man hear Myvoice&#44; and open the door&#44; I will come in to him&#44; and will sup with him&#44; and hewith Me.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 2: 17 &quot;He that hath an ear&#44; let him hear what the Spirit saith untothe churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna...&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Krupto&quot; -- &quot;Hidden&quot; -- to cover -- to conceal -- keep secret</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">God has manna that the natural &quot;...eye hath not seen&#44; nor ear heard&#44; neither have entered into the heart of man&#44; the things which God hathprepared for them that love Him. But God hath revealed them unto us by HisSpirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things&#44; yea&#44; the deep things of God.&quot; (ICor. 2: 9&#44; 10)</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Bathos&quot; -- &quot;Deep&quot; -- hidden -- secrets -- mysteries -- of God</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">God will reveal these truths to His people when they get hungry for them. They will be hungry in the wilderness (in the desolate --deserted -- lonely place). They will come to the realization that they needGod&#44; then God will feed them &quot;Manna from Heaven.&quot; Jesus said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Jn. 6: 32 &quot;...Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but My Fathergiveth you the true bread from heaven.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Israel was physically going from Egypt to Canaan land&#44; so they needed physical food. The Church is going from earth to heaven&#44; so theyneed spiritual food (manna from heaven) to grow to maturity. God requires thatthey &quot;<i>...be no more children&#44; tossed to and fro&#44; and carried about with everywind of doctrine&#44; by the sleight of men&#44; and cunning craftiness&#44; whereby theylie in wait to deceive;</i>&quot; (Eph. 4: 14)</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Remember&#44; this is in the &quot;wilderness&quot; that the &quot;Woman&quot; (theChurch) finds her &quot; <u>place </u>.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Topos&quot; -- &quot;Place&quot; -- position -- condition -- opportunity</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">She could have found this place before&#44; but was so occupied with the cares of this life that she had little time for the life to come. She(the Church) went to sleep spiritually and now is in a desperate condition&#44; inneed of God and His Truth. God will feed the hungry soul with &quot;<u>Manna</u> from <u>Heaven&quot;</u> (Divine Revelation). Jesus said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Jn. 8: 32 &quot;...Ye shall know the truth&#44; and the truth shall <b> <u>make</u></b>you free.&quot; </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Eleutheroo&quot; -- &quot;Make free&quot; -- to make free -- is used inregard to deliverance from sin</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">This is in the context of Jn. 8: 31&#44; &quot;<i>...If ye continue inMy Word&#44; then are ye My disciples indeed;</i>(now vs. 32)<i> And ye shall knowthe truth&#44; and the truth shall make you free.</i>&quot; It is a process ofunderstanding the truth and then applying the truth. In this process ofknowing and applying&#44; there is freedom from sin&#44; from bondage and from thecarnal.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The word &quot;Know&quot; comes from a Greek word &quot;Ginosko&#44;&quot; and hasin it the idea of experiential knowledge. This also has the idea of inceptionor progress in knowledge. Putting the two together you have a progress inknowledge that produces a progression experientially. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en">This verse is so often misquoted as&#44; &quot;<i>...ye shall know the truth and the truth shall</i>(set) <i>you free</i>.&quot; It does not say it will <b> <u>set</u></b>you free&#44; it says it will &quot;<b><i> <u>make</u></i></b><i> you free.</i>&quot; The freedom is dependent on the knowledge of the truth and the application of that truth. It is a process just as much as everything else in the spiritual realm is. We first are born into the kingdom of God as babes:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Pet. 2: 2 &quot;As newborn babes&#44; desire the sincere milk of the Word&#44; that yemay <u>grow</u> thereby:&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">God wants His people to grow up&#44; mature and not remain &quot;<i>babes</i>.&quot; Paul&#44; writing to the Corinthians:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Cor. 3: 1--3 &quot;And I&#44; brethren&#44; could not speak unto you as untospiritual&#44; but as unto carnal&#44; even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed youwith milk&#44; and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it&#44; neitheryet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among youenvying&#44; and strife&#44; and divisions&#44; are ye not carnal&#44; and walk as men?&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Writing to the Ephesians Paul said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 4: 14&#44; 15 &quot;That we henceforth be no more children&#44; tossed to and fro&#44;and carried about with every wind of doctrine... Speaking the truth in love&#44; may <u>grow up </u> into Him in all things&#44; which is the head&#44; even Christ:&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en"> &quot;Nepios&quot; -- &quot;Children&quot; -- immature -- infant -- none speaking --simple minded -- childish</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Paul in Heb. 5: is rebuking the believers for their statusas babes because they were not growing or maturing:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 5: 12--14 &quot;For when for the time ye ought to be teachers&#44; ye have needthat one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God;and are become such as have need of milk&#44; and not of strong meat. For everyone that useth milk is unskilful in the Word of righteousness: for he is a <u>babe</u>. But <u>strong meat</u> (&quot;Stereoo&quot; -- solid; &quot;Trophe&quot; -- food -- nourishment)belongeth to them that are of <u>full age</u> (mature)&#44; even those whoby reason of <u>use </u> have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Aistheterion&quot; -- &quot;Senses&quot; -- the faculty of perception -- thecapacities for spiritual apprehension</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Amplified N.T. says&#44; &quot;Solid food is for full-grown men&#44;for those whose senses and mental faculties are trained by practice todiscriminate and distinguish between what is morally good and noble and what isevil and contrary.&quot;</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Eph. 4: 13 &quot;Till we all come in the unity of the faith&#44; and of theknowledge of the Son of God&#44; unto a perfect man&#44; unto the measure of thestature of the fulness of Christ:&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Amplified N.T. speaking of the Church&#44; &quot;(That it mightdevelop) until we all attain oneness in the faith and in the comprehension ofthe full and accurate knowledge of the Son of God; that (we might arrive) atreally mature manhood -- the completeness of personality which is nothing lessthan the standard height of <u>Christ&#39;s own perfection</u> -- themeasure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ&#44; and the completenessfound in Him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Paul said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 6: 1 &quot;...Let us go on unto perfection...&quot; Maturity -- full growth -- fullage</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Church will be nourished and fed in the wilderness until she becomes mature. Then&#44; and only then&#44; will she be ready for Rapture. Thefive wise virgins were wakened by the midnight call and &quot;<i>...arose&#44; and trimmed</i>(&quot;kosmeo&quot; -- put in proper order -- arrange -- adorn -- garnish)<i> theirlamps.</i>&quot;</span></p>
<h4><span lang="en">The Time of the Churches Nourishing</span></h4>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 6 &quot;...They should feed her there a thousand two hundred andthreescore days.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 12: 14 &quot;...She is nourished for a time&#44; and times&#44; and half a time...&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Church is nourished and brought to the place of maturity during these three-and-a-half years of persecution&#44; the first half of theTribulation Hour. Remember&#44; it is during this time of persecution that theChurch is aroused&#44; awakened and prepared for Rapture&#44; in the middle of theTribulation Hour.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 6 &quot;And at midnight there was a cry made&#44; Behold&#44; the Bridegroomcometh; go ye out to meet Him.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Church has been left to go into Tribulation because she was not &quot;<i>...watching and praying...</i>&quot; nor &quot;<i>...found worthy to escape.</i>&quot; This is much like Israel as a nation who could have escaped the forty years of wandering in the wilderness&#44; but did not because of unbelief and rebellion. Likewise&#44; the Church could have escaped the first three-and-a-half years ofGreat Persecution&#44; but because of unbelief and rebellion&#44; they will go intothat time of persecution to be purified and made ready for the Marriage Supperof the Lamb.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The first three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation Hour arenot&#44; as many have said&#44; the releasing of God&#39;s judgment and wrath&#44; which isreserved for the last three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. The first three-and-a-half years are a time of Great Persecution to the Church to cause her to repent and prepare herself for the Marriage Supper.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Thes. 4: 16&#44; 17 &quot;For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with ashout&#44; with the voice of the archangel&#44; and with the trump of God: and the deadin Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain (&quot;Perileipo&quot; --to leave over -- or left) shall be caught up together with them in the clouds&#44;to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">These are not left from the dead; these are left from the translation of the Bride. Both those that were dead and those that were aliveare caught up together. The Bride is returning with the Lord to Rapture theChurch in the middle of the Tribulation and to invite the Church to theMarriage Supper of the Lamb.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 9 &quot;...Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper ofthe Lamb....&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Jesus warned concerning the persecution that was to come to the Church.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 10: 17 &quot;But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to thecouncils&#44; and they will scourge you in their synagogues;&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 24: 9 &quot;Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted&#44; and shallkill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for My name&apos;s sake.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Notice in what context this is said&#44; verse 8 says&#44; &quot;<i>All these are the beginning of sorrows.</i>&quot;</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Odin&quot; -- &quot;Pain&quot; -- sorrow -- Tribulation -- persecution</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 21: 12 &quot;But <b> <u>before</u></b> all these&#44; they shall lay their handson you&#44; and persecute you&#44; delivering you up to the synagogues&#44; and intoprisons&#44; being brought before kings and rulers for My name&apos;s sake.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The question&#44; &quot;Before what&quot; must be answered to understandwhat is being said. Before the judgment of God there is going to bepersecution. </span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 21: 11 &quot;...Great earthquakes shall be in divers places&#44; and famines&#44; andpestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">This is speaking of the last three-and-a-half years of theTribulation when the judgments of God and the wrath of God are poured out withoutmixture. This is the time when the Seals&#44; the Trumpets&#44; the Vials and theThunders of God&#39;s judgments are released on the earth. Again&#44; contrary to theminds of most&#44; these judgments are not released until the last three-and-a-halfyears&#44; which is the Great <b>Tribulation</b>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">But before this&#44; as Jesus said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en"> Lk. 21: 12 &quot;...They shall lay their hands on you&#44; and <u>persecute</u>you...&quot; </span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Great <b>Persecution</b> is the first three-and-a-half yearsof the Tribulation.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">II Tim. 3: 12 &quot;Yea&#44; and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shallsuffer persecution.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Jesus Himself suffered persecution.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Jn. 15: 20 &quot;Remember the Word that I said unto you&#44; The servant is notgreater than his lord. If they have persecuted Me&#44; they will also persecuteyou...&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">The Bride will have suffered.</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Rom. 8: 17 &quot;...If so be that we suffer with Him&#44; that we may be alsoglorified together.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span lang="en">II Tim. 2: 12 &quot;If we suffer&#44; we shall also reign with Him: if we deny Him&#44;He also will deny us:&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">So then&#44; the Church will suffer and suffer greatly under thepersecution that will come upon her&#44; because she did not keep His Word.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">What the preaching of the Word does not do in this hour&#44;persecution will do in the time of Tribulation. Jesus said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 24: 22 &quot;And except those days should be shortened&#44; there should noflesh be saved: but for the elect&apos;s sake those days shall be shortened.&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">Those days shall be shortened for the sake of the Church that has applied the truth under persecution and made preparation to receiveHim when He comes in the clouds. This is not seven years&#44; but only three-and-a-half years. It will be a time of unparalleled anguish and persecution. Would to God that the Church would have heard His voice as He knocked&#44; and responded and been counted worthy to escape &quot;<i>... <u>all</u> these things</i>.&quot;</span></p>
<h4><span lang="en">&quot;From the Face of the Serpent&quot;</span></h4>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Prosopon&quot; -- &quot;Face&quot; -- as being towards -- presence</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Scripture can clearly be understood to be saying&#44; &quot;From the presence of the serpent.&quot; They are now being led from the darkness oferror and false doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Many today are being deceived and giving heed to seducing spirits&#44; and <u>doctrines of devils</u>. They are being seduced by demons (in the presence of demons)&#44; and are being <u>deceived</u> by these evil spirits. As Paul said:</span></p>
<blockquote><span lang="en">I Tim. 4: 1 &quot;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly&#44; that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith&#44; giving heed to seducing spirits&#44; anddoctrines of devils;&quot;</span></blockquote>
<p><span lang="en">&quot;Planos&quot; is an adjective signifying wandering&#44; leading astray&#44; or seducing. It denotes an imposter&#44; deceiver&#44; or corrupter.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">The Church has been deceived and rocked to sleep in the arms of the devil and the world&#44; much like Samson was rocked to sleep in the arms ofDelilah where he lost the touch of God on his life. Likewise&#44; the touch of God and the Spirit of God has been lost from the life of the Church. As Samson regained his strength while he suffered&#44; the Church will also regain its strength under persecution in the Tribulation. In the Tribulation Hour theChurch will <u>turn from</u> the &quot;face&quot; (the presence) of the serpent and all his lies and deceptions.</span></p>
