Each of these different schools of teaching have a certain amount of truth concerning the rapture. However&#44; they go wrong when they take the part that is truth and make that partto be the 
<u>whole</u> truth. Therefore&#44; when they make the part to be thewhole&#44; they distort the truth and end up in error and false doctrine.</span></p><p><span lang="en">They also believe there is only one catching away. This is another point where they go wrong. Many of these teachers are very sincere in what they believe. I believe that they unintentionally misinterpret theScriptures. However&#44; they need to recognize that they not only support &quot;theirpart&quot; with Scripture&#44; but the others also support &quot;their part&quot; with Scripture.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Support of Scripture</span></p><h4><span lang="en">Something will Take Place Before the Tribulation</span></h4><p><span lang="en">Scriptures support the fact that something will take place before the Tribulation.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 21: 36  &quot;Watch ye therefore&#44; and pray always&#44; that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass&#44; and to stand before the Son of Man.&quot; </span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">There will be some that will be counted &quot;<i>worthy to escape all these things.</i>&quot;</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Acts 15: 14--16  &quot;Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles&#44; to take out of them a people for His name. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written&#44; <b>

This is His secret coming in the air for the Church.</span></p><h4><span lang="en">Something will Take Place After the Tribulation</span></h4><p><span lang="en">Scripture supports the fact that something will take placeafter the Tribulation.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 24: 29--31  &quot;Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall thesun be darkened&#44; and the moon shall not give her light&#44; and the stars shallfall from heaven&#44; and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And thenshall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall all thetribes of the earth mourn&#44; and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the cloudsof heaven with power and great glory.

And I said untohim&#44; Sir&#44; thou knowest. And he said to me&#44; These are they which <b>
<u>came</u></b><b>
<u>out</u></b> of Great Tribulation&#44; and have washed their robes&#44; and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This is the time when the Lord comes in judgment with His holy angels.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 11--16  &quot;And I saw heaven opened&#44; and behold a white horse; and Hethat sat upon him was called Faithful and True&#44; and in righteousness He doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire&#44; and on His head were many crowns; and He had a name written&#44; that no man knew&#44; but He Himself. AndHe was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed Him upon white horses&#44;clothed in fine linen&#44; white and clean. And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword&#44; that with it He should smite the nations: and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath ofAlmighty God. And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written&#44; KINGOF KINGS&#44; AND LORD OF LORDS.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">The Truth of the Rapture</span></h2><p><span lang="en">There is considerable evidence in the Scripture that reveals that there is more than one catching away.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Translation of the Bride of Christ </span></p><p><span lang="en">Most of the controversy and argument over the Rapture is caused by the fact that some see Scripture indicating Pre-Tribulation Rapture and that is all they see. Others see only Scripture dealing with theMid-Tribulation Rapture. Still others see only the Post-Tribulation scriptures. Each different school of thought supports themselves withScripture. Therefore&#44; because they see only one of these positions&#44; they try to force all the other scriptures into their one Rapture theory. Attempting to make the one part of truth to be the whole&#44; they end up with a distortion of the truth. However&#44; if they would consider the whole truth in their examination of Scripture&#44; they would have to come to the conclusion that there is not just one event but three. One event has to do with the Bride (theOvercomer)&#44; which is translated out of the Church before the beginning ofTribulation. Jesus said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 21: 36 &quot;Watch ye therefore&#44; and pray always&#44; that ye may be accounted worthy to escape (Ekpheugo -- vanish from) all these things that shall come topass&#44; 
<u>and to stand before the Son of Man</u>.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Bride&#44; like Enoch&#44; will be translated before the judgment.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Heb. 11: 5 &quot;
<u>By faith Enoch</u> was translated that he should not see death; and was not found&#44; because God had translated him: 
<u>for before his translation</u> he had this testimony&#44; that 
<u>he pleased God</u>.&quot; </span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Before the Tribulation&#44; the Bride of Christ (the Overcomer)made herself ready for the marriage.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 8  &quot;And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen&#44; clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Bride was found worthy to escape all the things that were to come upon the earth.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Rapture of the Church</span></p><p><span lang="en">After the translation of the Bride&#44; the Church goes into the first three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. Under great persecution theChurch will be awakened out of sleep and prepared (&quot;<i>trim their lamps</i>&quot;)for the Rapture in the Middle of the Tribulation hour. </span></p><p><span lang="en">The Church will then be invited to the marriage feast. </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 7--10 &quot;Then all those virgins arose&#44; and trimmed their lamps....And they that were ready went in with Him to the marriage (Marriage feast):&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Lk. 12: 35--38 &quot;Let your loins be girded about&#44; (with Truth) and your 
<u>lights burning</u>; (you can have a lamp without oil&#44; but to have a lighted lamp burning you have to have oil&#44; symbolic of the Holy Spirit). And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord&#44; when He will 
<u>return from the wedding</u>; that when He cometh and knocketh&#44; they may open unto Him immediately. Blessed are those servants&#44; whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you&#44; that He shall gird Himself&#44; and make them to sit down to meat&#44; and will come forth and serve them. And if He shall come in the 
<u>second watch</u>&#44; or come in the 
<u>third watch</u>...&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The First Watch has already taken place with the Translation of the Bride. Now He comes&#44; as obviously indicated&#44; between the Second andThird Watch. This agrees with what the Lord said in Matt. 25: 6&#44; &quot;<i>And at Midnight...</i>&quot; which is between the two watches.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 25: 1-10  &quot;Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins&#44; which took their lamps&#44; and went forth to meet the Bridegroom (and theBride). And five of them were wise&#44; and five were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps&#44; and took no oil with them: But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the Bridegroom tarried&#44; they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made&#44; Behold&#44; theBridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him. Then all those virgins arose&#44; and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise&#44; Give us of your oil;for our lamps are gone out. But the wise answered&#44; saying&#44; Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell&#44; and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy&#44; the Bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with Him to the marriage (feast): and the door was shut.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">The Church has been made ready for Rapture by persecution during the first three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation&#44; and is called to the&quot;Wedding Feast.&quot; </span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">I Thes. 4: 16&#44; 17 &quot;For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout&#44; with the voice of the archangel&#44; and with the trump of God: and the deadin Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds&#44; to meet the Lord in the air: and so shallwe ever be with the Lord.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 19: 9 &quot;And he saith unto me&#44; Write&#44; Blessed are they which are called unto the 
<u>marriage supper</u> of the Lamb. And he saith unto me&#44; These are the true sayings of God.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This event of the Rapture of the Church is followed by the saved (the Born-Again)&#44; who have lived loosely and their garments have become spotted by the flesh&#44; going into the last three-and-a-half years of theTribulation Hour. They are represented by the &quot;five foolish virgins&quot; that could not go into the Marriage Feast. (Matt. 25: 11&#44; 12) These will be refined and made ready for the Lord when He returns literally to the earth to set upHis Kingdom at the end of the Tribulation Hour.  The Apostle John says in:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 7: 9 &quot;I beheld&#44; and&#44; lo&#44; a great multitude&#44; which no man could number&#44; of all nations&#44; and kindreds&#44; and people&#44; and tongues&#44; stood before theThrone and before the Lamb&#44; clothed with white robes&#44; and palms in their hands.&quot;</span></blockquote><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 7: 13&#44; 14 &quot;One of the elders answered&#44; saying unto me&#44; what are these which are arrayed in white robes? And whence came they? And I said unto him&#44;Sir thou knowest. And he said unto me&#44; These are they which came out of 
<u>Great Tribulation</u>&#44; and have 
<u>washed</u> their robes&#44; and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">Their garments had become spotted and they had need of being washed.</span></p><p><span lang="en">One of the arguments against Pre-Tribulation Rapture orTranslation is the fact that the early church fathers did not speak or write much about it. But remember&#44; Jesus did speak about a Pre-TribulationTranslation in Lk. 21: 36 &quot;<i>
<u>Escape All</u>.</i>&quot; Again Jesus said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Rev. 3: 10 &quot;Because thou hast kept the Word of My patience&#44; I also will 
<u>keep thee from</u> the hour of temptation (trial-Tribulation)&#44; which shall come upon all the world&#44; to try them that dwell upon the earth.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">You must also remember there are some things that have been concealed until the time of the end. The Angel of God told Daniel the Prophet:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Dan. 12: 4 &quot;Shut up the words&#44; and seal the Book&#44; even to the time of the end.&quot;</span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">We are now living in the time of the end&#44; and God is revealing truth that has been hidden.</span></p><p><span lang="en">Zechariah said:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Zech. 14: 7 &quot;It shall come to pass&#44; that at evening time it shall belight.&quot; </span></blockquote><p><span lang="en">This is not a paradox&#44; this is a Divine Revelation that in &quot;<i>thetime of the 
<u>end</u></i>&#44;&quot; &quot;<i>evening time</i>&#44;&quot; there &quot;<i>shall be light</i>&quot;(Revelation of Truth). This is not light that dispels the darkness altogether. This is &quot;flashing light&quot; like &quot;lightning.&quot; This &quot;light&quot; will not be seen by everyone&#44; it will only be seen by those that are looking in the right direction (with an open heart); God reveals truth unto them by HisSpirit.</span></p><p><span lang="en">The Literal Return of Christ</span></p><p><span lang="en"> At this time&#44; Christ shall set up His earthly kingdom and reign and rule on the earth.</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en">Matt. 24: 29--31  &quot;Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened&#44; and the moon shall not give her light&#44; and the stars shall fall from heaven&#44; and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn&#44; and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He shall send His angels witha great sound of a trumpet&#44; and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds&#44; from one end of heaven to the other.&quot;</span></blockquote><h2><span lang="en">There are Three Events -- Not One </span></h2><p><span lang="en">The Translation of the Overcomers out of the (Laodicean) Church that have Made Themselves Ready for the Wedding</span></p><p><span lang="en">Out of those that have been 
<u>Born</u>-
<u>Again</u>&#44; and from those that have been 
<u>Baptized</u> into the Body (the Church) will come those that live the Overcoming life&#44; and are 
<u>Overcomers</u> (the Bride ofChrist). Throughout Scripture&#44; this fact is repeated over and over again. When the seed of the Word of God was sown:</span></p><blockquote><span lang="en"> Matt. 13: 23 &quot;He that received Seed into the good ground is he that heareth the Word&#44; and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit&#44; and bringethforth&#44; some an
