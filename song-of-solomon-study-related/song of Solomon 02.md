Lesson Two
#Christ and His Bride

The song of songs, which is Solomon's. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.
Song of Solomon 1:1-2


THE EARTHLY SETTING
Song of Solomon begins with an earthly setting, but goes far beyond that.
The main focal point of this book is Christ and His Bride.


•	Song of Solomon is five songs compiled into one.

•	Song of Solomon is the expression of King Solomon who is possessor of all the wealth and all that goes along with his kingdom.

•	There is a young maiden spoken of throughout the song that is the delight of Solomon's eye. She stands out from all the rest. 

•	King Solomon has the privilege to seduce any young maiden that he desires by his riches, by his success by his position as king, and he has chosen to seduce her.

•	This lady that Solomon tries to seduce will not let him, and she will not even look upon him. She will not be seduced by his popularity, by his position or by his prosperity.

“She has a single eye to one little shepherd boy that is out on the hillside, and she loves him beyond anything that Solomon can offer to her.”


**Song of Solomon 1:7**
> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

**Genesis 38:15** 

> When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face

**II Samuel 15:30** 


> And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

•	Some believe that is the little lady that they took and brought into David when we was an old man and dying to keep him warm

**I Kings 1:1-4** 
 	

> Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. {stricken...: Heb. entered into days}
 	Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.


**I Kings 11:3** 


> And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

Solomon could not attract the attention of this maiden away from the shepherd 

**I Peter 2:25** 


> For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

Solomon, a man positioned as king, was what drew the attention of Israel away from God. They needed to have a singleness of eye for the Lord.

**Acts 2:46** 


> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, 

 **Ephesians 6:5** 


> Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;

**Colossians 3:22** 


> Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:

**I Samuel 8:5-9**


> And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.
And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.

**Hosea 13:11** 


> I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.

**Psalms 106:15** 


> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.

Solomon was a very wealthy king.

**I Kings 10:14** 
 	

> Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 

**II Chronicles 9:13** 


> Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

**Revelation 13:18** 


> Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six

**Yet all the material wealth does not appeal to the young maiden**

 Solomon as the king reigning on the throne with all of his riches and finery of life **in the background** of the story speaks of the world and all it’s riches making it’s appeal for the soul, drawing, attracting and seducing.
The shepherd boy speaks of the One that is the Shepherd of the soul. 

**Only in Jesus can we be totally satisfied**. She has a satisfied dissatisfied feeling. She had just enough to want more. She has been near him but not near enough to satisfy her

**HEAVENLY THINGS**
In this study we are not speaking of earthly things, but of Heavenly things—of Christ and His Bride.

The king’s position in the spiritual aspect is used in relationship to the Bridegroom throughout the Song.

#Christ and His Bride

##This is a Song

•	Song of Songs: Song of Solomon is five songs compiled into one.

**I Kings 4:32** 


> And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were **a thousand and five**

•	Out the thousand and five we have but five. All the things that the LORD has wanted us to have have been preserved in the Bible. There is nothing lost that He wanted us to have, nor is there anything in the Bible that He didn’t want us to have.

###  The Author of the Song

“The Song of Songs which is Solomon’s”

1.	The Heavenly Solomon 
The earthly Solomon is the writer but not the author.

2.	The name Solomon means Peaceful or Prince of Peace.

a.	Solomon typifies the peaceful reign of Jesus in His millennial reign.

**I Chronicles 28:3**


> But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood

**I Chronicles 22:9** 


> Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.

•	David is a type of the Son that fought the great battle overthrowing the enemy.
•	Solomon is a type of His returning as a ruling King reigning in peace. 

 **Revelation 20:2-7**


> And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
 	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,

**Isaiah 2:4** 


> And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 

 **Micah 4:3** 


> And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 
 
**Hosea 2:18** 


> And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.


b.	Jesus is the Prince of Peace because He gives us peace.

He has made a covenant with us also 
and it cannot and will not be broken.


**Matthew 24:35** 


> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

**Mark 13:31** 


> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

**Luke 21:33** 


> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

**Isaiah 9:6** 


> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 


•	We are talking about the One that has authored this book rather than the writer.

•	The Song of songs by the Heavenly Solomon expressing His feeling toward the little maiden and the expressions of that maiden’s feelings toward Him.

•	The intent of this song reaches beyond the human comprehension. It is not vulgar, but is beautiful

###  The Greatest of Songs
“The Song of Song’s which is Solomon’s”

**Revelation 17:14**


> These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

**Hebrews 9:3**


> And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;

**Nehemiah  9:6** 


> Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.

**II Corinthians 12:2** 


> I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third 
> heaven*.


*THIRD HEAVEN
   EXPLAINED

FIRST HEAVEN
•	The Atmosphere is called Heaven.
SECOND HEAVEN
•	The Outerspace is called the Heavens.
THIRD HEAVEN
•	God’s throne is called Heaven of heavens.

As there is a place above all other places, 
this is a song that is above all other songs.

**This song is not just an expression of human feeling, but is the expression of the Eternal Son in relationship to those who love Him and He is calling them to Himself**.

###  The Ineffable Song



1.	Un-Comprehensive Song
The carnal mind cannot understand it.

				1. It takes Revelation of the Spirit of God
				2. It takes Illumination of the Spirit of God
				3. It takes Inspiration of the Spirit of God


** II Timothy 3:16**


> All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for  reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

2.	Unspeakable Song

“Joy unspeakable and full of glory.” [song]


**I Kings 10:7** 
> Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.

**Ephesians 2:7** 

> That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

###  The Pre-eminent Song

**Isaiah 6:1**


> In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple

**Colossians 1:18** 


> And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
   

##A Song of Love 

This is a Love Song of Christ and His Bride 

Divine   -        The Bridegroom is Jesus and He is expressing Himself.

Maiden -        The Bride is in love with Jesus and His Word and she responds with true expressions.

###  A Love Song--(deep expression- true love-real love)
The words of the Bridegroom are revealed by the Spirit.

2.  The response of the young maiden.




	a.	Let Him Kiss me
 

     “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth:”
The Bride never mentions the name of the Bridegroom but describes Him as 
		O thou whom my soul loveth
			 Her Beloved  and the King                                

                         1).  Let Him
                          She has a singleness of eye
 kiss-  The seal of a Close Relationship  single eye- can’t see any one else

         	True Love has a single eye- she is totally separated from the world

 Vs.2 “ Let him”

              1:2 “for thy love”
              1:7 “Whom my soul loveth” embraced by only Him
              She has one love and there is no other that has her attention.  
              She is totally committed to Him.

     Note:  He will not embrace you while you embrace the world.
God is a jealous God and He wants you for Himself.

Talk about the one you love 
God is looking for an expression from her that He is it.
The first-The last-and He is the only one.

               b.  Let Him kiss me
                           her lover is absent and she has an inner longing for Him

 The great love of the maiden and the expression of her desire.

                     The cry of the soul:
                         Oh to be in His presence                                 
                             To be near Him
                                 To feel His embrace in your soul
Though Jesus is absent from us yet He is near at hand

Ps. 110:1; Acts 2:33; 7:55-56; Eph. 1:20; Col.3:1

**Mark 16:19** 

> So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

**Hebrews 1:3** 


> Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
> 
 
**Hebrews 8:1** 

> Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
Hebrews 10 
 12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;

 **Hebrews 12:2** 

> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. 

The touch of  His presence totally satisfies our needs.
          Burdens?                    Trial?
          Pressure?                    Torment?
          Problems?
He kisses away all our troubles and our problems.
Get closer to Him.

         3.  The kisses of His mouth
                    a. Let Him kiss me
                          The love, in the song of her lover, expressed to her, in the fact that she so desired His kisses.
**Psalms 2:12** 

> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

 Do you know what the kisses mean in the bible?

        				1) The kiss of Reconciliation  
Those that were separated from their family setting, when they came back they received a kiss and restores us into fellowship.

**2 Samuel 14:33** 

> So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
> 
**Lu 15:20** 

> And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. 
Lu 15:24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.                      

                       2) Kiss of Acceptance 

He accepts us as we accept Him.
                    
        			   3)  Kiss of an Expression of Real Love.
The Spirit of God touching our lives, the Graces of God being made manifest in our hearts.

					b.	Song 1:2 ¶ Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth:
The expression of real love, real intimate feelings.
Living and moving with Him in the Spirit.- a realm most do not understand.

                         1.) Demands a close relationship to Him.  
To receive the kisses of the Lord you have got to be close.
Nothing demands our attention as much as Jesus.


Re 2:4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.

An expression among foreigners ---to kiss their own hand.

IT’S NOT THE BRIDE IT IS THE BRIDEGROOM

###  A Song of Deep Love

**Song 1:2**  

> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: --- for thy love is better than wine.


               1. The Tokens of His love --- better than wine
 The Wine  is a Type of prosperity and of all desirable things

Love is not just in word it is in deed.
 
a.	The many things that He shares
	
b.	The many things that He gives.


**Php 4:19** 

> But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

His love is better than wine, better than this life, better than prosperity, better than anything in this world.

				2.	The expression reveals the Excellence of His Love.
In wine we have the expression of joy 


**Acts 2:18**


> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine. 
	But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:
For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.
But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;
 	And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:

 **Eph 5:18** 


> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;

The Love of the Saviour warms strengthens and comforts you.
					a. His love brings Joy     
       His love cheers us.
        His love strengthens us for coming trials and as His Bride.
         His love excels all  Joy.

 **Ne 8:10** 

> Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.

If you're going to be in the bride you will have to be embraced by Jesus, It will take all of His Love in you, for you to make it or your strength will run out.

					b.  His love brings Pleasure	
**Ps 16:11** 

> Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

Only His love can totally satisfy.

					c.	His love brings Strength.

His love will give you real strength, courage and boldness.

				3.	The Purpose of His Love.

Why is it that she wants His Love?

Why is it so necessary that we have His Love?

					a. It is necessary for us to have His love that we may 
Express real love.


**1Jo 4:19** 

> We love him, because he first loved us.

**John 14:21,23** 


> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.


THIS IS NOT A NATURAL EXPERIENCE
A TIME IN THE SPIRIT WHERE FOOD  LOOSES IT’S ATTRACTION AND TIME IS LOST.

The Bride is calling out to Him, but He is calling out to her. She is not where she should be, and He is drawing and calling her. He is making overtures to her. Let us get our cup filled not with wine, but with His love.

**Matthew 5:6**	 

> They that hunger and thirst… [a craving in our heart]

**Psalms 42:1**


> As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 

The Bride is going to thirst after Him. She is not going to thirst after all the things He could give, but **Him**—**His love**, His presence—are better than wine. 

God wants to manifest Himself in us and through us in a measure that this old world has never seen before.

How much of His presence do you have?

 
If you have enough to be satisfied than you do not have enough—

WE NEED MORE.

Is all that we have a ‘church affair’?

Are we only satisfying the natural and glorifying the flesh and not glorifying God?

                                     DRAW NEAR TO HIM    

Let Him develop His love in our hearts so that we can really love Him the way we ought to love Him.
