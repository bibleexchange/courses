<h1>Introduction to The Seven Trumpets (8:6-11:19)</h1>
<p>We are looking at the final blasts of judgment upon a wicked and rebellious world.</p>

<h2>The Martyrs are Remembered</h2>
<p>The seventh and final seal has been broken from the Sealed Book (8:1). The prayers of all the saints have been accepted before God (8:3,4). Remember now,God has promised to avenge the martyred saints.
</p>
	<blockquote>Revelation 6:9-11 -- And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? 11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>Matthew 18:6-7 -- But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</blockquote>
	
	<p>These martyred Believers are an important part of the judgments of God on the earth. It is not that the world has rejected these saints so much as they have rejected Christ.</p>

<blockquote>I Samuel 8:7 -- And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Luke 10:16 -- He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</blockquote>

<p>Every Christian martyr is a testimony to the grace of God and a witness against this sinful world. The Greek word &quot;martus&quot; (martyr) means a witness or record. (see Matthew 18:16; Mark 14:63; Luke 24:48; Acts 1:8,22; 2:32; Hebrews 12:1; I Peter 5:1; Revelation 1:5.)</p>

<blockquote>Luke 24:46-48 -- And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 48 And ye are witnesses of these things.</blockquote>

<h2>The Trumpets of Judgment Are Sounded</h2>

 <p>Time has now come for the final judgments.</p>
<blockquote>Revelation 8:6 -- And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</blockquote> 

<p>Not all seven were to sound at once, but varied events followed each trumpet as it was sounded. God has prearranged the order and time for each to sound. There are none that are alike but there is a progression of greater judgment with each trumpet.</p>
