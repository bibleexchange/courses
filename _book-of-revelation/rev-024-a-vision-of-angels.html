<h1>A Vision of Angels (8:2-5)</h1>

<h2>The Seven Angels, vs. 2</h2>

<p>They "stood before God" and are in harmony with his will and work. They are God&apos;s ministers and are in obedient submission to His will. They stand ready to do as He decrees and bear God&apos;s authority as His servants.</p>

<h3>They Are of Particular Rank and Distinction.</h3>
<p>They are of a Divine Order of angels. Angelic beings are not of one and the same grade or office.</p>

<h4>The Sons of God, in general, came before Him only at appointed times. Job 1:6;</h4> 
<h4>Yet, Jesus spake of some angels who "do always behold the face of their Father which is in heaven." Matt. 18:10.</h4>
<h4>In Colossians 1:16, Paul lists &quot;dominions, principalities, and powers&quot; as being among the celestial orders. </h4>
<h4>Daniel 10:13 speaks of some chief princes.</h4>
<h4>1 Thessalonians 4:16 and Jude 9 refer to arch angels.</h4> 

<h3>They Are Seven in Number.</h3>
<p>The Jews were familiar with seven angels of Divine Order by the names: 1) Gabriel, as he said to Zacharias; "I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God." 2) In Luke 1:19 Michael is another, as he is ranked with Gabriel in the book of Daniel. In the book of Enoch, these are the names of the angels who watch: 3) Uriel, 4) Raphael, 5) Raguel, 6) Michael, 7) Sarakiel</p>

<h3>They Are Servants.</h3>
<p>They are standing. This is the position of service. The twenty-four elders are going to be sitting. The sitting position speaks of the dominion and rule of the heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.</p>
<p>Yet &quot;standing in the presence of God&quot; is to be above all other servants. In Esther 1:4, The 7 Persian princes who &quot;saw the kings face&quot;, were the highest officers of the realm, and next to the monarch in rank and power.</p>

<h3>They Were Given Seven Trumpets.</h3>
<h4>Trumpets are expressive instruments and God gave special directions in the use of the trumpet. The word &quot;trumpet&quot; can be found in 61 verses of the Bible. (Exodus 19:13; Levitucs 25:9; Psalm 47:5)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets are an emblem of war. (Numbers 10:9; Jeremiah 4:19)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets were for the convocation of the people, and the moving of the camps of Israel. (Numbers 8)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets proclaimed the great festivals. (Numbers 10:10; Leviticus 23:24; 25:9; 2 Chronicles 29:27)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets are used to announce royalty. (1 Kings 1:34,39; 2 Kings 9:13)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets are associated with the majesty of God. (Ex. 19:16)</h4>
<h4>Trumpets were used in the overthrow of the ungodly. (Josh. 6:13-16)</h4>

<h2>The Mystery Angel, vs. 3-5</h2>
<p>John sees seven angels &quot;which stood before God&quot; and then he mentions &quot;another&quot; angel. Who is this &quot;angel&quot;?</p>

<h3>The Nature of &quot;The Angel&quot;</h3>
<p>&quot;Another&quot; (allos) means different. This same phrase is used in Revelation 7:2; 10:14-17; 18:1; 20:1. The word "angel" means messenger of God.</p>

<h3>The Office of &quot;The Angel&quot;</h3>
<p>This &quot;angel&quot; is the Angel of the Lord. He offers the prayers of saints. You cannot give something unless you have it. He had to receive them to give them. Angels do not receive worship, but &quot;the Angel of the Lord&quot; does. (Gen. 16:7,13; Ex. 3:2-5; Joshua 5:13-15).
</p>
<p>There are many passages in which the expression the &quot;angel of God&quot; or &quot;angel of the Lord&quot; is definitely for a manifestation of God Himself. Compare Genesis 22:11-12; 22:15-19; Exodus 3:2-6.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of The Angel</h3>
<p>Scripture itself presents us with details that tell us that this Angel is the Lord:</p>

<h4>The First Proof - He had &quot;a Golden censer&quot;</h4>
<img src='/assets/revelation/censer.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'>
<p>This instrument was used by the priests, in the ministry of the worship of God. However, it was used only by the high priest in the holy place. This indicating our great High Priest who is now entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. We remember that that this is a scene in Heaven.</p>

<h4>The Second Proof -He offers the Prayers of Saints before God.</h4>
<img src='/assets/revelation/praying-hands.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'>
<p>vs. 3 &quot;All Saints&quot;. There is no record of such an office found in the scripture as being assigned to angels, however, there is record of this office being executed by the Lord Jesus.
Eph. 2:18 I Tim. 2:5 Heb. 7:25; Heb. 13:15 I Peter 2:5 I John 2:1;</p>

<h4>The Third Proof - He casts fire on the earth.</h4>
<img src='/assets/revelation/fire.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'>
<p>Verse 5 tells us the fire is taken from the altar.</p>
<blockquote>Luke 12:49 -- I [Jesus] came to send fire upon the earth. </blockquote> 
<p>This fire is a symbol of the Divine Presence and Power. (Exodus 3:2 Deuteronomy 4:36 Psalm 50:3 97:3; Isaiah 66:15-16; Acts 2:3) 
<p>This fire is an Instrument of Divine Judgment. The action indicated here by the casting into the earth speaks of judgment. (Genesis 19:24; Leviticus 10:2; Numbers 11:1; 16:35; Malachi 4:1; 2 Kings 1:10; 2 Thessalonians 1:8; 2 Peter 3:10)</p>

<h4>The Fourth Proof - To offer incense with prayers. vs. 3-4</h4>
<img src='/assets/revelation/cross.jpg' width='150px' height='150px'>
<p>&quot;Given unto Him much Incense.&quot;It was given to Him through merit. For without His death and atoning work coupled with His pure and Holy life, there would be no force in prayer. God hears us because of Him. </p>

<p>The Compounding of the incense is given with great precision in the Old Testament. It was to be made of specific ingredients in exact proportion (Exodus 30:34). Any compound that did not meet the exact specifications given by God was to be rejected as strange incense (Exodus 30:9). It was to be tempered with salt as it was holy and was never to be used for ordinary purposes. Any one who tried to duplicate this incense for themselves was to be cut off from his people (Exodus 30:38).</p>
