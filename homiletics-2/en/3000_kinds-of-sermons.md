# Kinds of Sermons

"There are three major kinds of sermons Expository, Textual, and Topical. It could be said, and logically so, that the textual and topical sermons are merely variations of the expository sermon. "

There are different types of sermons that are effective in different settings:

1. Textual—The text gives the theme, title and divisions. The divisions are suggested by the prominent words of the text.

2. Topical—Founded on the theme or topic of the text.

<!--3. Textual-Topical—The sermon is treated textually and expressed topically.

4. Textual-Inferential—The sermon is drawn from inferences out of the text.-->

5. Expository—The sermon exposes or explains the text in its richness of meaning.
