</span>

</p><h2> 
<span lang="en" id='t775#' >Consider the historical setting of a passage to insure correct interpretation.
</span>

</h2><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t776#' >For example Daniel 5 opens with a feast of revelry and drinking. The city of Babylon had been undersiege by the Medo&ndash;Persians for two years prior to the opening feast of this chapter. This tells us something of the pride and arrogance of the Babylonians who thought they were indestructible. The only way to know about such historical considerations is to study research materials such as commentaries. A word of caution not all books are historically accurate. Special caution should be used for example when reading any material produced by the Roman Catholic church since they often alter the accounts to their advantage.

</p><h2> 
<span lang="en" id='t777#' >Consider archeological factors to help you understand the meaning of a passage.
</span>

</h2><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t778#' >Again in Daniel 5&#44; the walls of the city of Babylon were so thick that chariot races were held on top of the walls. The people thought there fortress was impenetrable. Archeology is in full support of the Bible. This is why study and education are so important to be able to understand these archeological facts in order to better understand the setting of the Biblical accounts.

</p><h2> 
<span lang="en" id='t779#' >Consider geographical factors that would contribute to the understanding of the passage.
</span>

</h2><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t780#' >We will stay in Daniel 5 to show you how all these considerations are taken together to glean the full meaning of the passage. The Euphrates River ran into the city of Babylon. They had a freshwater supply and grew their own food; this added to their feeling of unconcern of the siege for they thought they could hold out forever. The entrance of the River was protected buy two large iron gates. This information is helpful to understand the prophecy of Isaiah regarding Babylon. (Isaiah45:1) History tells us that on the night of the feast the guards got drunk and left the iron gates open. The prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled when Cyrus the Persian and Darius the Median took thekingdom of Babylon that night of the feast.

</p><h2> 
<span lang="en" id='t781#' >Consider cultural practices of the time setting of the passage.
</span>

</h2><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t782#' >Paul admonished the woman to keep silent in the church. I Cor. 14:3 A cultural practice of the day was forthe woman to sit on one side and the men on the other. The unlearned women were disrupting the service by asking questions across the aisle. A continuation of the context of the verse tells the woman to ask their husbands at home. Or&#44; to put it simply&#44; Paul was telling the wives to wait until they got home to ask their husbands a question and not to disrupt the service. Paul is in no way saying that woman have no place and should not be allowed to testify and participate in the church service.

</p><h2> 
<span lang="en" id='t783#' > Consider the entire Bible when interpreting the meaning of a passage.
</span>

</h2><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t784#' >God is not going to contradict Himself. What is written in one part of Scripture will always be in agreement with what is written in another part of Scriptur Correct hermeneutics will consider the whole of Scripture to glean the true meaning of the Word of God.
