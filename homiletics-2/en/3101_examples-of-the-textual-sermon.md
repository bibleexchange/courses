### Dividing a text into its parts: Outlining

The Bible is divided into books, chapters, paragraphs, verses. But further dissection is necessary for clear understanding and presentation of a text. We must divide the text into "sizeable" pieces (i. e. bite size).

#### Divide the Text into its parts

**Example:**

> Luke 9:1–5—Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority overall devils, and to cure diseases. 2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither havetwo coats apiece. 4 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thencedepart. 5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

1. Then he called his twelve disciples together

4. to preach the kingdom of God
5. and to heal
6. Take nothing for your journey
7. whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide
8. shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them
