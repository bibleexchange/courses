## Introduction to Homiletics

### What is Homiletics?

#### Homiletics is The science or art of religious discourse or preaching.

#### How to prepare sermon outlines and preach.

#### The preaching of one central theme (the Biblical pattern.)

### What is Preaching?

#### The spoken communication of Divine truth with a view to persuasion.

#### Preaching is God's method to reach the lost souls of men

> I Corinthians 1:21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by
> wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to
> save them that believe.

Preaching is all about God's Word. II Tim. 4:2 "PREACH THE WORD"

The preacher's authority is found in the authority of the Word of God.

> Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is
> the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the
> Jew first, and also to the Greek.

## The Importance of Holy Ghost Empowered Preaching I Cor. 2:4,5

The anointing breaks the yoke. Isaiah 10:27; 61:1

This class involves the preparation and presentation of a sermon. We must always remember the absolute necessity of the anointing of the Holy Ghost in the life of the preacher. The preacher must be endued with power of the Holy Ghost. Study and preparation with the anointing of the Holy Ghost will not complete the ministry of the preacher in the pulpit. The goal of this class is to show the importance of study and preparation combined with the anointing of the Holy Ghost.

> 2 Corinthians 3:6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

The word "unction" literally means to smear in New Testament Greek. Unction refers to the saturating presence of God that helps men preach with power and authority.

## The Study of God's Word

Why Study? 2 Tim. 2:15; Jer. 31:5; II Peter 1:20; I Cor. 2:13

I Cor. 12:13 compared with Ephesians 1:22--23.

A good way to study a Scripture is to break it down into main phrases of the text. You can then study each main thought of the text separately. The plan of the effective preacher is to share one portion of truth at a time. Separating the Scripture into parts will help you to preach on part of the Scripture and then go on to the next part and build the sermon on the whole text one piece at a time.

## The Delivery of the Sermon

Preaching is not a performance but it is still public speaking requiring skill.

Maintain Eye contact, avoid nervous habits, use proper diction, be passionate, and be ACTIVE.

The preacher should be himself during the delivery of the sermon. Do not try to imitate other preachers. You should never try to be someone else behind the pulpit. Some try to imitate the actions and motions of other preachers thinking this will some how make them appear more spiritual or be more effective. This is not an effective way to preach the Gospel. The best way to preach is to be you. God called YOU to preach!

Eye contact is crucial to good sermon delivery. Proper diction is necessary for a clear delivery of the sermon, as well.

## The Qualifications of the Preacher

The scope of the preacher's qualification is MENTAL, MORAL & SPIRITUAL

Christian, Holy Ghost Filled, Called, Student of the Bible., man of prayer, clean in life, physically & mentally fit for service I Cor. 4:13; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:15; II Timothy 2:15; I Thessalonians 5:17; Eccl. 9:10

The preacher must be called of God. The call of God is an inner conviction given by the Holy Ghost, confirmed by the Word of God and confirmed by the Body of Christ.

## Christian Preaching: Matter, Manner, Mission

The Matter of Preaching is DIVINE TRUTH (Tells us what to preach.)

The Manner of Preaching is SPOKEN COMMUNICATION (Tells us how to preach.)

The Mission of Preaching is to with a VIEW TO PERSUASION. (Tells us why we preach.)

"The salvation of souls, Spiritual growth, Produce faith, Instruct the church, Encourage Believers, Bring to a point of decision (persuasion)"

## The Theme & Thesis

Effective communication demands a single theme

The theme is the subject upon which the preacher preaches. EXAMPLE: "Unbelief in the Believer."

"The thesis statement is the one complete sentence that will define the subject to be preached."

"John 11:33--35,42 THESIS STATEMENT: The unbelief of man grieves the heart of God. "

### EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION DEMANDS A SINGLE THEME.

The theme refers to the main subject of the sermon. It is the main though or idea that is to be communicated to the people. The theme will answer the question, "What am I talking about?"The theme is simply the subject the sermon is going to be about.

What is God's message for the people today? Your theme should be the answer to that question.

The theme should never be only one word. Single words are to vague to form a complete and concise theme. The preacher's subject must be narrowed down and form a complete and definitethought. For example, there are so many aspects of love that could be preached in a sermon. You need to know what part of love you intend to preach for your current sermon. The theme should narrowly define the subject to be preached.

Remember, as a rule, the text should naturally suggest the chosen theme. The theme should be drawn from thetext that is to be preached. The Word should always be the foundation for the sermon.

### THE THESIS STATEMENT COMPLETES THE THEME.

"Thesis statement" refers to acomplete sentence that will define the subject to be preached. A thesisstatement is the entire sermon stated in one complete sentence.

A subject cannot stand alone andalone it cannot be clearly understood. A subject needs a complement to becomplete. A complete sentence needs both a subject and a predicate. The thesis statement will add a predicate to the theme or subject. The thesis statementdeclares what you are going to say about your theme.

The theme answers the questions, "What am I going to say?" The thesis statement answers the questions, "What amI going to say, about the theme?"

EXAMPLE OF A THEME: "Winning Youth to Christ"

EXAMPLE OF A THESIS STATEMENT: "You can win your youth to Christ."

## The Text

### Meaning of the Text

The text is the foundational Scripture upon which the sermon is built. The theme should be naturally drawn from thetext. (Luke 4:16--20; Neh. 8:8; II Tim. 4:2).

Complimentary texts: John 10:7; Romans 5:2/ Isaiah 26:; Phil. 4:7

Contrasting texts: Heb. 12:29; I John 4:8 / II Sam. 24:4; Heb. 10:31

Parallel texts: The if's of John 11 (9,10,12,21,40) / "I have sinned" Ex. 9:27; Nu. 22:34; I Sam. 15:24; Matthew 27:4

### Treatment of the Text

#### The Expository Sermon Outline

The Expository Sermon concernsitself with the complete "paragraph" which most usually includes severalverses, an entire chapter or even an entire book. Literally, the most completeexpository sermon would concern itself with the entire Bible! The divisions inan expository sermon outline are formed by the words of the text (which shouldbe, concerning length, the entire paragraph and not a portion of it.) The goalof the expository sermon is to thoroughly "expose" the text. In theexpository sermon much more attention is given to context: surrounding verses,historical setting, author's intent, relevant Biblical customs, originallanguage details, etc. This empowers the expository preacher to give thecomplete sense of meaning to his text.

#### The Textual Sermon Outline

The Textual Sermon outline is a mini expository outline. Where the expository sermon isconcerned with the entire paragraph, the textual sermon concerns itself with amuch smaller portion of the paragraph, while still including a complete thought.The proper text for a textual outline could be a sentence from a verse or eventwo or three verses in length, but rarely is the textual sermon appropriatelyany longer than that.

The prominent words of the text form the divisions of the sermon. It follows closely to the words of the text, clause by clause. The text is taken apartinto manageable portions, for the purpose of a thorough examination of the chosentext.

#### The Textual--Topical Sermon Outline

The divisions of the Textual--Topical Sermon outline are expressed topically, but treated textually. The text itself still provides the natural divisions of thesermon "treated textually". The thoughts contained within thosedivisions is explained using words that expound on the topic. ("expressed topically") The divisions are formed as in a textual sermon, but those divisions are thenexpressed in the words of the preacher in such a way that it brings unity tothe sermon and complements the theme.

#### The Topical Sermon Outline

The topical sermon is founded onthe theme of the text, rather than the words of the text. The theme is mostprominent in a topical sermon. The divisions of the topical sermon areformulated by the preacher which should be based on the theme.
