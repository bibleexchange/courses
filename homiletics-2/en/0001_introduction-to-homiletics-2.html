<span lang="en" id='t37#' >This class involves the preparation and presentation of a sermon. We must always remember the absolute necessity of the anointing of the Holy Ghost in the life of the preacher. The preacher must be endued with power of the Holy Ghost. Study and preparation with the anointing of the Holy Ghost will not complete the ministry of the preacher in the pulpit. The goal of this class is to show the importance of study and preparation combined with the anointing of the Holy Ghost.

<span lang="en" id='t43#' >A good way to study a Scripture is to break it down into main phrases of the text. You can then study each main thought of the text separately. The plan of the effective preacher is to share one portion of truth at a time. Separating the Scripture into parts will help you to preach on part of the Scripture and then go on to the next part and build the sermon on the whole text one piece at a time.

Some try to imitate the actions and motions of other preachers thinking this will some how make them appear more spiritual or be more effective. This is not an effective way to preach the Gospel. The best way to preach is to be you. God called YOU to preach!
