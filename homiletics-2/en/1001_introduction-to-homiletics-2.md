# Introduction

This class will teach how to prepare a basic sermon outline. An outline is a simple way of taking notes on the Scripture that has been studied. The outline is simple notes which make a framework for the sermon. A well organized outline will aid in the preaching of the sermon.

You will learn how to organize what you have studied into one central theme or subject. The sermons recorded in the Bible have one central theme. The theme is the one main subject or thought which will be the main focus of the sermon. The preaching of one central theme is a **biblical pattern**. This method makes it easier for the congregation to comprehend and therefore receive what has been preached. Good homiletics helps the preacher stay focused on the message that God has for the people.
