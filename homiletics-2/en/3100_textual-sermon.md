## The Textual Sermon

Textual sermons are those in which the subject and main divisions are derived from the text. Gibbs in his book, The Preacher and His Preaching, says that the textual sermon consists of selecting verses, a verse, or even the part of a verse as the text.

### Divisions

The prominent words of the text form the divisions of the sermon. Follows closely the words of the text, clause by clause. The text is taken apart into manageable portions, for the purpose of a thorough examination of the text. The text is not taken apart with a club, as a child might break up a watch. The text is taken apart with the precision of a watchmaker.

Division of the text in its precise language. At clear, natural breaking points within the text. A correct interpretation of the words of the text. The meaning in the original language (Strong’s, Vine’s). Considering the context of the word within the verse. Considering the context of the verse within the entire passage.

### Advantages of the textual sermon

#### The structure (divisions) are already made

#### It is true to the Scripture

### Success

The success of the textual sermon. Dependent upon the selection of the text. Certain texts are better suited to textual treatment. Other texts are best treated in a topical manner. Many texts can be treated in a variety of different ways.

### Distinguishing characteristics of this type of sermon

#### It should be natural and easy to develop a flowing of thought to thought

Do not force divisions at awkward breaking points. 

#### There should be a distinct advancement in thought

Each division should carry the theme one more step towards the climax. It is not always necessary to divide the words of the text as they occur, as long as there is advance of direction within the sermon itself.

### Ways to receive a text

2. Pay attention to things in life that will remind you of a Scripture.
3. Listen to other preachers.
4. Listen to the Spirit. He will put it in your heart (John 14:26).
