## Title

The name given to the sermon is called a title. Most of the time a title is extremely helpful in clarifying your topic to the hearers. Not every sermon has to have a catchy title like “Running for the Gold,” but your sermon direction needs to be communicated to the hearers near the start of the sermon. A title is the simplest way to tell the hearers, “This is the direction we are going in today.”
