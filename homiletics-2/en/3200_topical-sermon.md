## Topical Outlines

Topical sermons are those in which the subject alone is derived from the text. The preacher is instrumental in the organization of the topical sermon. His topic is derived from the text, but how the topic is treated is determined by the preacher.

How is the Topical Outline Different from the Textual Outline?

1. It is founded on the theme or topic of the text, rather than on the words of the text.
2. The theme is most prominent in a topical sermon.
3. The divisions of the sermon are formulated by the preacher. (Which should be based on the theme)

The topical sermon is founded on the theme or topic of the text, rather than on the words of the text. The theme is most-prominent in a topical sermon. The divisions of the sermon are formulated by the preacher (which should be based on the theme.) The text should naturally suggest the theme even though the theme can actually be chosen first. The treatment style of the text will be rhetorical—clearly expounding on the theme. The topical sermon should be a thorough presentation of a topic.

### Advantages of the Topical Sermon

#### It allows for rhetorical perfection

If the aim of preaching be to make the sermon a work of art, let it be treated topically.

#### It allows for thorough examination of the theme

A single text rarely does this.

#### It trains the mind to breadth of view—to look at the whole picture

The topical sermon greatly encourages considerations of the whole council of God.

The spirit of the words is what we should aim to bring into the light, and not just the bare words.

#### A theme can be chosen first, A text can then be selected, Which supports that theme

### Distinguishing characteristics of the topical sermon

#### Exhaustive

Every facet of the "gem" is held to the light.

#### Rhetorical

It has unity, coherence, emphasis, and euphony.

#### Illustrative

This sermon type provides opportunity for illustrations and stories.

#### Climactic

The topical Sermon rises to successive climaxes reaching a well-defined conclusion.

#### Persuasive

The element of argument should be found in every sermon. Action should be our aim. The proposition must be proved to get proper action.

Plain, direct application should be found in every sermon. No sermon should lack application. No congregation should be deprived of application.

> Without plain, direct application the preacher does little more than fire blank cartridges; he invites us to a field day rather than challenges us to aconflict.  
>—T. Harwood Pattison

#### Progressive

The points are indicated, reached and reviewed. Plain direct application should be found in every sermon.

### Steps for finding the theme of a Scripture

#### Observation

Carefully go over the text to see what is going on, the "who, what, where, when, how, and why."This will pull out facts through the nature of Scripture and help avoid presumptions and fallacies. Allow the Word of God to "speak for Itself."

Read the Text in Its Context Several Times. For example, if you are studying the Book of John, begin with reading the whole book.

Make sure you are going into your relationship with God's Word in a meaningful manner. If you start too hastily, thinking you already know thepassage, you will not gain the insights and depth because your haste will make waste.

Never let your pride clog your vision and keep you in the dark or from discovering all you can.

#### Write a Summary for the Passage in Your Own Words

1. Then you may start to look for the principal theme and idea.
2. Start with an introduction; it needs to state the main topic or idea of the outline . This is the general principle/idea that represents the passage you are studying.
3. Then write a short description of that idea.
4. Make sure it is accurate to the text.
5. Make sure you write down the verses next to each idea.

The chapter and verses were added by the publisher and are not part of the original text nor are they inspired. So, donot constrain yourself to them. You will find that sometimes they cut off key ideas in mid-thought that are still in "thread," that is, still going on.

#### Then List All Of the Various Ideas/Points in Sequence

This is where you use "Interpretation". This is taking what is said and finding out what the text means, how to interpret literally in the correct context.

Always, always go in the sequence of the text. Do not jump around! Never take out of God's Word what is not there, or read in your will as His.

Each sub--topic describes the main ideas from the paragraph/passage. When supporting information is listed under a sub-topic, there is a sequence that follows a logical order, especially in the Epistles.

### Success

The success of the topical sermon is dependent on the rhetorical ability of the preacher. He must be a student of the Word and able to give a well organized presentation of truth. The strength of this sermon type lies in keeping with the topic at hand. An acceptable topical sermon will be an exhaustive presentation of the theme where every facet of the gem is held to the light.
