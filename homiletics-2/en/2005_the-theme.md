## The Theme

The theme is the main subject of the sermon. It is the main thought or idea that is to be communicated to the people. The theme will answer the question: "What am I talking about?" The theme or subject is simply what the sermon is going to be about. What is the message that God has for the people? This one message or subject is what is called the theme.

A sermon should not be scattered, unrelated thoughts going in every direction, but every thought should be united by a single theme or subject. Preaching is not stand-up comedy or story time, but is eternal business where the preacher waits on God for the message of the hour and then follows through to the best of his ability to communicate that single theme in his preaching. Do not preach your own thoughts, but preach the mind of God.

### The theme expresses the purpose the preacher has in mind

The preacher should always have a purpose. There needs to be a target in view. You should not be shooting buckshot, hoping to hit something. Preaching should have the precision of a sharpshooter. If you aim at nothing you will hit nothing.

A clear purpose will insure only one theme in the sermon. There may be more than one theme in the text, but there should not be more than one in the sermon.

### The advantages of having a theme

#### Effective communication demands a single theme

You will learn in this class that the use of one main theme was the Biblical pattern for the prophets and preachers. The prophets had a message from God; they declared God’s message with authority and precision. The sermons in the New Testament contain one single theme. The preacher must have a message from God. There is a difference between a preacher that simply picks a sermon to preach and a preacher that has a message from God. God is a God of order and timing. God has a message for the people; you need to know the message of God for the time that you will preach.

You must be able to communicate the message to the people. The message will have one main thought or theme; the one point that God wants to impress upon the people that day. This is not about just trying to be intellectual or an orator. It is about receiving a message from God and then preaching that message to the people. The purpose of this class is to help the preacher deliver the message from God to the people. The message is expressed in words.

#### The theme insures arrangement in the sermon

A sermon should not be a collection of thoughts that have little or no relationship to each other. This class will teach you how to break the sermon into workable portions which will be preached one part at a time. These parts will be referred to in this class as the points of the sermon. This can be compared to preparing a meal and then serving it one course at a time.

The points of the sermon should always relate to the theme and progress like steps taken on a journey. You are building upon the theme one step at a time. You will advance the theme one point at a time with each point always referring back to the theme.

The theme should be kept in mind when preparing the sermon.

#### The theme promotes unity in the sermon

Let the sermon be the one message that God has for the people. You are preaching one sermon and not several little sermons.

Let the theme be evident throughout the sermon. Would a late-comer be able to determine the subject of the sermon? Could the hearers answer the question: What is the preacher talking about? The theme should remain the final and ruling impression on the hearer's mind.

#### The theme helps to give clearness of thought to the sermon

The preacher must clearly define his theme if he wants his sermon to be clearly understood. Do not aim at more than what can be discussed in the time given. “He grasps at the stars and sticks in the mud."—John Wesley

Narrowly define the subject to be preached. The thesis statement is the term used to refer to a complete sentence that clearly defines the sermon to be preached. This will be dealt with later. Keep the theme within practical limitations, deal with one aspect of truth at a time and try to save something for next time.

### Different types of themes

1. Doctrinal—Instructional preaching of Bible doctrine (II Tim. 4:2).
2. Historical—Setting the historical scene of a Scripture passage (Telling the story). Relating of history to inspire faith (Great revivals).
3. Biographical—Preaching on Scriptural persons and great people of God.
4. Exegetical—An explanation or thorough examination of the text.
5. Prophetical—Show how prophecy has been fulfilled. Scripturally unfold God's plan for the future.

### Biblical precedent for a theme

**The Old Testament prophets’** messages were clear messages from God. They had a complete message that contained one theme at a time. There was a specific purpose for each of the messages. The specific purpose was to persuade the people to return to God by warning the people of coming judgment and other prophecies of future events.

**Jesus** preached well organized discourses and He is the supreme example of the preacher. A central theme is evident in the sermons of Jesus.

The sermons of the **NT apostles** were proclamations of a single idea. The example set by the NT apostles demonstrated the importance of one major theme. The sermons were directed toward a particular audience and contained a singular message.

**Each book of the Bible** expresses a unified theme. For example, Psalms is not incoherent and painfully random, but over and over again it expresses the vital elements of worship.

### The characteristics of the theme

#### The theme should narrowly define the subject to be preached

It should not be too broad of a subject to be covered in one sermon. In a single sermon, one concise concept should be addressed.

#### The theme should be expressed with clearness of thought

Use plain, simple speech while you are preaching. The theme should be easily understood by the congregation.

#### The subject of a sermon should never be only one word

Single words are too vague to form a complete subject. Single words like worship, faith and love are too broad for a sermon subject. The subject needs to be clearly expressed to form a complete thought. For example, there are so many aspects of love that could be preached in a sermon. You need to know what part of love you intend to preach for one sermon.

#### The theme should come from the text

As a rule, the text naturally suggests the theme. The text is the portion of Scripture that is read before the sermon is preached. Remember that you are preaching the Word. The theme should flow naturally from the Scripture. The text should not need to be flung on the rack and tortured before the theme can be extracted from it. The theme should also be evident in the text as one of its ruling ideas. During the delivery of the sermon it is effective to frequently use the words of the text. Remember to preach the Word because your authority comes from the Word.

**EXERCISE: Identify the main theme of each of the following texts and then identify some of their subthemes. John 10:7--10; Psalm 14:1; John 14:6;**
