</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t606#' >Action is the goal of the challenging conclusion. This use of your conclusion seeks to challenge your listeners to action. Assuming they remembered what was said and know God is speaking to them and not just somebody else&#44; you seek to inspire them to respond to the sermon with action. An example of this could be giving an altar call to sinners and calling them to repent and pray to God without delay. The action that is challenged to in this type of conclusion is that the sinners would PRAY to God and be born again.
