Value of Hermeneutics


</h2><p> 
It is not only foolish, butdangerous to misinterpret the Bibl It is espaically detrimental to abuseScripture intentionally. There are objective principles of interpretation thatguide us in understanding and teach Scriptur These principles serve asboundary lines that keep our exaplanation and presention of biblical thought"within bounds."

ILLUSTRATION:"The Book of Abraham" is included in The Pearl of Great Price, a small volume of material designated as part of the official"scripture" of the LDS Church. It is accepted by Mormons that it wastranslated from an Egyptian papyrus by a miraculous, divine "gift oftranslation" by Joseph Smith (founder of Mormonism) during the period1835–184During, Smith's lifetime Egyptian hieroglyphics were not understoodby any language experts and therefore Smith felt free in his interpretation ofthe papyrus. Years after Smith and after the discovery of the Rosetta stonewhich unlocked the meaning of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, expertsdiscovered Smith's so called "Book of Abraham written by Abaraham's own hand onpapyrus" was merely a common Egyptian funerary document. Joseph Smith used noscience or rules of interpretation; he completely fabricated the document'smeanin It is a crime to abuse Scripture this way. We cannot tamper with God'sperfect word; this would only mar what the Lord has done through these HolyScriptures. Revelation 22:18, 1

In Homiletics I we refer to themisuse of Scripture as an accommodated text and some preachers wronglyattempt to make the Scripture accommodate their own philosophies. The Bible isnot to be subjected to what we want it to mean, but our study of Scriptureshould always be to discover God's messag To do this we must use objectiveprinciples of interpretation good hermeneutics and allow Scripture to speak foritsel

2 Peter 1:16–21–20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
