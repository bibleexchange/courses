PRINCIPLE FIVE: CONTEXT IS THE GREATEST KEY TO INTERPRETATION.


</h1><h2> 
This fifth principle is pretty much "all encompassing" Context takes in all the individual parts of the whole. 


</h2><h3> 
The context of Scripture involves the placement of a verse within its particular chapter and book, (Each verse of Scripture is profoundly important, but its importance can onlybe understood by considering its role in the paragraph, chapter, book, or even the Bible as a whol)


</h3><h3> 
The context of Scripture involves the historical details influential at the time a passage was written,and the (Paul wrote Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon from prison! Also, Paul was born in Tarsus the capital of Cilicia andhome to one of only three great universities of the ancient world Athens andAlexandria are the other two. Paul was trained in Jerusalem under Gamaliel thegreat teacher of Jewish Law. Paul received the best education possible in hisday. He was no uneducated idiot.)


</h3><h3> 
The context of Scripture involves the personalities and characteristics of the authors. (We wouldjudge a record written by an eye witness different from a record written bysomeone with second–hand information.)


</h3><h2> 
We cannot properly study a small portion of anything without carefully consideringthe whole and the sum of its parts. Imagine how incomplete your understandingof airplanes would be if you were not educated in the natural laws. The flight of an airplane would forever be a mystery until you studied the airplane in the"context" of its natural environment wind, gravity, air pressure, et

A great key to correct Biblical interpretationis to understand a passage within its context. A complete understanding of the book the text is taken from is best.

A text taken out of context is pretext. A "pretext" is used to disguise the real motive and intention. Using Scripture as a pretext is using Scripture to say what you want it to say and not what God has to say. A text taken out of context is an abuse of Scripture.

The Bible containsan inspired account of events that occurred and statements that were mad Forexample the Book of Job records the conversations between Job and his friends. The conversation is recorded accurately as it took place, but the council ofJob's comforters is not good council and should not be regarded as such.

The temptation of Jesus found in Matthew 4: 1–11 records the devil quotingScripture to Jesus in vs. 6. The devil twisted the meaning of Ps. 91:11–12 totempt Jesus to jump off of the templ Jesus refuted the devil's misuse of theScripture by responding with another Scripture: Thou shalt not tempt theLord thy God Deut. 6:16

Daniel 3:29 —Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, whichspeak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shallbe cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there isno other God that can deliver after this sort.

"Taking portions of Scripture out of context and trying to piece them together is not a proper way of correct Biblical interpretation. For example the Bible tells us that Judas went out and hung himself (Mt. 27:5) the Bible also contains the words go ye and do likewise (Lk. 10:37) If someone were to try and piece these two Scriptures together the results would obviously not be good."
