#### The thought contained within the divisions is explained using words that expound upon the topic. (Expressed topically).

#### The thought rather than the words of the text is made prominent.

#### EXAMPLE:

> sanctification and honour;

## You need to know how to possess yourself.

# TEXT: Philippians 2:12

> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence
> only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation
> with fear and trembling.

## Dividing a text into its parts: Outlining

\"The Bible is divided into books,chapters, paragraphs, verses. But
further dissection is necessary for clear understanding and presentation
of a text. We must divide the text into \"sizeable\" pieces. (e., bite
size). \"

### Divide the Text into its parts.

### Relate the parts of the Text

### Simplify the parts of the Text.

### EXAMPLE 1: (Divide the text into its parts):

> Luke 9:1---5 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave
> them power and authority overall devils, and to cure diseases. 2 And
> he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 3 And
> he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor
> scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither havetwo coats apiece. 4
> And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thencedepart. 5
> And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city,shake
> off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
