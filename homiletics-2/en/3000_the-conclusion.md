# Ch. 3: The Conclusion

The definition of \"conclusion\" is: \"conclusion\" is a noun meaning a
decision based on facts; final part of something. final settlement of
something. closing argument in a trial. (Encarta Dictionary)

There are at Least Three Kinds of Sermon \"Conclusions\".

## The Summary Conclusion

One Possible Goal for Your Conclusion Could be To summarize the core
ideas of your sermon.

If you preach for any length of time most of what you have said will be
forgotten by your listeners. You can use your conclusion to remind the
listeners of the most important thoughts of your sermon. Do not leave
anything to chance, but tell your listeners what they should remember.

### The Formal Summary

### The Common Sense Summary

### The Epigrammatic Summary

## The Relative Conclusion

A Second Possible Goal for Your Conclusion Could be To relate the core
ideas of your sermon to your listeners.

This use of a conclusion, assumes the listeners remember well enough
what was said, but need to be shown how what was said relates to them.
You can try to answer the question, \"I have heard what you said, but
why does it matter to me?\" Seek to cause the listeners to know that God
is speaking to them personally and not just their neighbor.

### Conclusions that Propose specific procedures.

### Conclusions that apply ideas to audience interest.

## The Challenging Conclusion

A Third Possible Goal for Your Conclusion Could be To Challenge your
listeners to respond to your sermon.

Action is the goal of the challenging conclusion. This use of your
conclusion seeks to challenge your listeners to action. Assuming they
remembered what was said and know God is speaking to them and not just
somebody else, you seek to inspire them to respond to the sermon with
action. An example of this could be giving an altar call to sinners and
calling them to repent and pray to God without delay. The action that is
challenged to in this type of conclusion is that the sinners would PRAY
to God and be born again.

### Appeal to Local Interests.

### Appeal to Higher Motives.

### Appeal to Emotions.
