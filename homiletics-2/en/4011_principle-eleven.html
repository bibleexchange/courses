PRINCIPLE ELEVEN: We must be taught by the Holy Spirit. He is the Master Teacher!


</h1><blockquote> 
I Cor. 2:13–14—Which things also we speak,not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghostteacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural manreceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness untohim: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.


</blockquote><p> 
Be careful of the words which men's wisdom teacheth.


</p><p> 
Commentaries can be helpful especially to learn about culture and history, but they are nosubstitute for the teaching of the Holy Ghost. In fact many of the commentators that are held so dearly did not believe in the Baptism of the HolyGhost.


</p><p> 
Weigh everything against the Holy Ghost inspired Word of God.


</p><p> 
Correct interpretation will always be in agreement with the rest of the Bible.


</p><p> 
 The Holy Ghost will teach you.


</p><blockquote> 
John 14:26—But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father willsend in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.


</blockquote><blockquote> 
John 16:13—Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.


</blockquote><p> 
This is a promise of God.


</p><p> 
Pray for understanding of the Word you are studying.


</p><p> 
God is faithful to reveal His Word to you.


</p><p> 
Stand on the promise of the Word to be taught by the Holy Spirit.


</p><p> 
Meditate on the Word of God.


</p><blockquote> 
Joshua 1:8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thoushalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do accordingto all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous,and then thou shalt have good success.
