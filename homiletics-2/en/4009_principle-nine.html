</h1> <h2> 
<span lang="en" id='t727#' >"All languages are not equal. As a matter of fact&#44; each language is unique with its own strengths and weaknesses. The uniqueness of each language makes the study of it complex&#44; but exciting! Greek and Hebrew are vastly different from each other and equally different from our modern languages. The peculiarities of the Biblical languages should be studied and understood even to interpret Scripture that is translated in our native tongue. "

</h2> <p class='first'> 
<span lang="en" id='t728#' >EXAMPLE 1: Christ's address to Mary in John 19:26 sounds a bit harsh in English: &quot; Woman&#44;behold thy son!&quot;As a matter of fact&#44; it sounds very derogatory in English. We interpret this passage not in light of how it sounds in English&#44; but how it sounds in the Greek because that is the original and inspired language of the book of John and the Hebrew or Aramaic because that is probably the language which Christ spoke In Hebrew&#44; &quot;woman&quot; has the opposite sound than that in English; it is a term of respect such as &quot;madam.&quot;

<span lang="en" id='t729#' >EXAMPLE 2: Ephesians 5:18 cannot be completely appreciated in the English. And be not drunk with wine&#44; wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; The word &quot;excess&quot; is a translation of the Greek &quot;asotia&quot; Asotia is a compound word meaning &quot;no salvation.&quot; Understanding the Greek sheds great light on the meaning of this passage.

</p> <h2> 
<span lang="en" id='t730#' >"Looking up the meaning of words in a dictionary can help the preacher gain a better understanding of the Scripture. The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew and the New Testament was originally written in Greek. There are reference books available such as the Strong's Concordance and the Vine's Expository Dictionary. These books give the meaning of words in theoriginal languages. The use of a regular language dictionary like Webster's can also help in understanding the meaning of words in the Scripture passage."

<span lang="en" id='t731#' >"EXAMPLE: The word &quot;servant&quot; in Romans 1:1 is doulos in the original Greeklanguage and it means a love servant or one who chooses of his own free willto be a servant. Paul was not orced to be a servant of Jesus&#44; but rather chose to be a servant of Christ because of his great love for the Lor Looking up the meaning of the word servant helps you to understand the right meaning of the passage."

</h2> <p>
<span lang="en" id='t732#' >"Also&#44; consideration must be given to the age of the translation in your own language. Words within a language have the habit of evolving and changing in meaning over time and even meaning completely opposite to their original meaning. Since its translation in 1611&#44;the KJV has stood as giant among Bible translations. But&#44; in the past 400 years approximately 800 English words in the KJV have now changed in meaning or are no longer in common usage at all!"

<span lang="en" id='t739#' >"As a result&#44; there often are fine shades of meaning in English that do not exist in the original text. For instance&#44; &quot;royal&quot; means &quot;having to do with royalty&quot;. &quot;Regal&quot; gives the mental image of &quot;in a grandiose manner&#44; with lots of pomp and circumstance&quot;. Often&#44; an English translator has no choice; he must choose between English words that have more precise meanings than the original language because there is no equivalent 'broad' word in English. In making his choice he is not only translating the text&#44; he is also changing the meaning to a certain extent. For instance&#44; &quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of all wisdom.&quot; The Hebrew word is half&ndash;way between&quot;dread&quot; and &quot;reverence&quot;. No English word exists that has the exact same meaning."
