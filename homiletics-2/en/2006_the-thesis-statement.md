## The thesis statement

### What is the thesis statement?

The term thesis statement is used to refer to the one complete sentence that will define the subject to be preached. **It is the entire sermon described in one complete sentence.** It is a way of expressing what the sermon is going to be about. It is the entire sermon described in one complete sentence. It is to let the people know where you are going so they can follow you. It is the theme expressed in a clear, complete and concise sentence—a sentence that will give direction to the sermon. The thesis statement will narrow broad subjects.

### The thesis statement completes the subject

A subject cannot stand alone. A subject needs a complement to be complete. A complete sentence needs both a subject and a predicate. This statement will add a predicate to the subject. You need to know what you are going to say about your subject.

* The subject answers the question: What am I going to say?
* The thesis statement answers the question: What am I going to say, about what I am going to say?

For example, a possible thesis statement for a sermon preached from Romans 10:17 could simply be: True faith requires a Word from God and then obedience to act upon that Word. This answers the question: what am I going to say about faith? The complete sentence (thesis statement) gives a focus for the sermon.

### The thesis statement is of great value

The thesis statement allows you to know exactly what the sermon is to be about. Put the message that you have received from God into one sentence. It lays a foundation for the entire sermon and will help you introduce the sermon. In one sentence, you will be able tell the people what you intend to preach. The people will know where you are going so they can easily follow you. It helps the people to retain the main subject of the sermon and answer the question: “What was the sermon about?” Since people are able to recall from memory a fraction of what they hear, a thesis statement packages the message into a memorable size so they can take the truth home with them.
