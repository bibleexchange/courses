PRINCIPLE EIGHT: PASSAGES CAN HAVE BOTH NEAR AND FAR APPLICATIONS.


</h1><p> 
APPLICATION, Reaction to the text


</p><p> 
Scripture often has a near and far application. Relating to a soon coming event, also to be fulfilled at a latter time events in the End Time.


</p><p> 
For a valid interpretation with a near and far application, it must be clearly allowed by the text context book the Bible as a whole.


</p><p> 
Passages written to Israel, can have valueable meaning to the present day Church.


</p><p> 
In exegesis we try to expose the 1)Original Meaning of the text; while in, 2)Personal Application we seek to find significance in the text for us today.


</p><p> 
These two endeavors together create a spiral of interpretation called the "Hermeneutical spiral" (Grant R. Osborne)


</p><p> 
Although an event recorded in Scripture happened at a definite time in history passed, the principles of its passages are timeless and personally relevant.


</p><p> 
"The relationship between meaning and significance summarizes the hermeneutical task. The preacher must ask how the biblical writer would have applied the theological truths of the passage if he were addressing them to the modern congregation."


</p><p> 
INDUCTIVE STUDY is when the bible student interacts with the text directly to form our own conclusions.


</p><p> 
DEDUCTIVE STUDY is when the bible student interacts with other scholars' conclusions and rework our findings. (helpful in taking us away from our contemporary meanings and personal experiences.)


</p><p> 
It is important that we interact with exegetical tools critically and not uncritically parroting other people's ideas.
