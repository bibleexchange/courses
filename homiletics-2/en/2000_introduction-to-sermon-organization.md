# Ch. 2: Sermon Organization

# INTRODUCTION

"Outlining" is taking what we have learned in our study of the Scripture and then laying it out in an orderly and efficient way so we can understand it and explain it better. Outlining will enable the preacher and teacher to impart knowledge to others in a more profound and impacting way. Remember that Scripture is the source of Christian teaching; all we do is tap into it and pour out God's most precious precepts for all to drink.

"Why Should We Make an Outline? Organization is very important to the communication of the Gospel and outlines are essential tools of organization. There are no shortcuts to good Biblical preaching. Outlining will be your primary means of producing quality, Bible--centered lessons, talks, and sermons."

"There are three major kinds of sermons Expository, Textual, and Topical. It could be said, and logically so, that the textual and topical sermons are merely variations of the expository sermon. "

## Expository sermons are those in which the subject, maindivisions and most of the details are derived from the text.

"The expository sermons is concerned with the "paragraph" instead of merely the verse. This form of sermon may be the surest route to proper interpretation and presentation of Scripture. Homiletics III will more thoroughly explore the expository sermon."

## Textual sermons are those in which the subject and main divisions are derived from the text.

"The Textual Sermon is a miniature Expository Sermon covering a few verses, a verse, or part of a verse, but not the whole paragraph. Even though the textual sermon covers fewer verses than the expository sermon, the subject does come from the Bible and each major point comes from those verses. Yes, there is less material from which to get the supporting material, but it still may be possible. The textual sermon is just a shorter form of the expository sermon and covers only a few verses, a verse or part of a verse, but still expounds that shorter portion of Scripture. The value of the textual sermon is in dealing with a manageable portion of Scripture appropriate for the present setting."

## Topical sermons are those in which the subject alone is derived from the text.

The preacher is instrumental in the organization of the topical sermon. His topic is derived from the text, but how the topic is treated is determined by the preacher.
