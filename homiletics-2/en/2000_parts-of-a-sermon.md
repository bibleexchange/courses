# Parts of a Sermon

### A sermon should be outlined and have a structured, logical order of thought

You must know where you are going and lead on a path that your hearers can follow!

#### Text

Draw the sermon out of a text. Preach the Word!

#### Title

The name given to the sermon is called a title. Most of the time a title is extremely helpful in clarifying your topic to the hearers. Not every sermon has to have a catchy title like “Running for the Gold,” but your sermon direction needs to be communicated to the hearers near the start of the sermon. A title is the simplest way to tell the hearers, “This is the direction we are going in today.”

#### Theme

The theme is the main subject of the sermon. A sermon should not be scattered, unrelated thoughts going in every direction, but every thought should be united by a single theme or subject. Preaching is not stand-up comedy or story time, but is eternal business where the preacher waits on God for the message of the hour and then follows through to the best of his ability to communicate that single theme in his preaching. Do not preach your own thoughts, but preach the mind of God.

#### Introduction

Lead the congregation into the sermon. Do not ramble, but use the beginning moments to lay the foundation of the sermon. Lean wholly on the leading of the Holy Ghost that He would prepare the hearts and minds of the hearers to receive the message of the hour.

#### Body

The body of the sermon outline includes the meat and substance of the sermon expressed as main points. The sermon is built step by step in the body of the outline.

#### Conclusion

The conclusion is the end of a sermon, but is not merely the point where you say you are done, but is perhaps the most important part of the sermon. It is so important because it is an intense time of decision for the hearers. The conclusion should include a call to action. The question, “What should be said in the conclusion?” is answered by answering another question, “If the congregation were to leave forgetting everything that I have said in my sermon except for one thing, what would I want that one thing to be?” The answer to that question should be your conclusion.
