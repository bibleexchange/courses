## The Introduction

The introduction is the most important part of the sermon. This is the time for you to get the people's attention. If they are not interested in the introduction, then they probably will not be interested in the rest of the sermon. Surprise or shock the people to get their attention. Tell them a joke, story, or object lesson, but make sure that it helps explain your subject. Do not use a story just because it is funny or interesting. If a story is interesting, but it does not agree with your theme, then it will hurt your sermon and not help it. You can also begin by relating your subject to current events that people heard from the news.

Questions are a good way to start. You can ask a question, and maybe the people will give an answer or maybe they will not, but it is good to get them thinking about the problem. Jesus used many questions in His preaching.

Lead the congregation into the sermon. Do not ramble, but use the beginning moments to lay the foundation of the sermon. Do not just talk or tell stories that have nothing to do with your subject. If you are new to a church, you can take a short moment to greet the people and thank them for inviting you, but do this very quickly.

Lean wholly on the leading of the Holy Ghost that He would prepare the hearts and minds of the hearers to receive the message of the hour.
