# Topical Outlines

## How is the Topical Outline Different from the Textual Outline?

### Founded on the theme or topic of the text, rather than on the words of the text.

### The theme is most prominent in a topical sermon.

### The divisions of the sermon are formulated by the preacher. (Which should be based on the theme)

### The text should naturally suggest the theme.

## Advantages of the Topical Sermon

### It allows for rhetorical perfection. (If the aim of preaching be to make the sermon a work of art, let it be treated topically.

### It allows for thorough examination of the theme. (A single text rarely does this.)

### It trains the mind to breadth of view. (The spirit of the words is what we shouldaim to bring into the light, and not just the bare words.)

### A theme can be chosen first, A text can then be selected, Which supports that theme.

## Treatment of the Topical Sermon

### Its style.

#### RHETORICAL (unity, coherence, emphasis, euphony \[See English II notes on the "Principles of Rhetoric"\])

#### ILLUSTRATIVE (Opportunity for illustrations, "stories".)

#### CLIMACTIC (Rises to successive climaxes reaching to a well--defined conclusion.)

#### PERSUASIVE (Ends with recapitulation, application, and earnestness.)

##### The element of argument should be found in every sermon. Action should be our aim. The proposition must be proved to get proper action.

##### Plain, direct application should be found in every sermon. No sermon should lack application. No congregation should be deprived of application.

> Without plain, direct application the preacher does little more than fire blank cartridges; he invites us to a field day rather than challenges us to aconflict.  
>â€”T. Harwood Pattison

### Its arrangement.

#### PROGRESSIVE (The points are indicated, reached, and reviewed.)

#### EXHAUSTIVE (Every facet of the "gem" is held to the light.)

## Observation.

"Carefully go over the text to see what is going on, the "who, what, where, when, how, and why."This will pull out facts through the nature of Scripture and help avoid presumptions and fallacies. Allow the Word of God to "speak for Itself.""

### Read the Text in Its Context Several Times. For example, if you are studying the Book of John, begin with reading the whole book.

### "Make sure you are going into your relationship with God's Word in ameaningful manner. If you start too hastily, thinking you already know thepassage, you will not gain the insights and depth because your haste will make waste."

### Never let your pride clog your vision and keep you in the dark or from discovering all you can.

## Write a Summary for the Passage in Your Own Words

### Then you may start to look for the principal theme and idea.

### Start with an introduction; it needs to state the main topic or idea of the outline . This is the general principle/idea that represents the passage you are studying.

### Then write a short description of that idea.

#### Make sure it is accurate to the text.

#### Make sure you write down the verses next to each idea.

### "The chapter and verses were added by the publisher and are not part of the original text nor are they inspired. So, donot constrain yourself to them. You will find that sometimes they cut off key ideas in mid--thought that are still in "thread," that is, still going on. "

## Then List All Of the Various Ideas/Points in Sequence.

### This is where you use "Interpretation". This is taking what is said and finding out what the text means, how to interpret literally in the correct context.

### This is where the supporting information and details go. This is called your Sub--Topic; these are commonly listed under the idea/topic with each piece ofinformation listed separately.

### Always, always go in the sequence of the text. Do not jump around!

### Never take out of God's Word what is not there, or read in your will as His.

### Each sub--topic describes the main ideas from the paragraph/passage.

When supporting information is listed under a sub--topic, there is a
sequence that follows a logical order, especially in the Epistles.

"In the narrative passages, you will also find a logical order of events. However, Hebrew literature does sometimes jump the points around. It is best just to stick to the text and in the opening, summary, or conclusion, to draw attention to the general context. "

### There are normally two ideas of information that should be listed. If there is only one piece of information to support a sub--topic, traditionally that information is included in the sub--topic.

### "Do not be so concerned with your form that you neglect your principal duty, which is to present the text in a logical and systematic way. Being true to the Lord's Word and the Divine Author's intent is paramount."
