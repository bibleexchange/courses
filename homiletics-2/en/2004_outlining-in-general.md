# Outlining In General

\"First, look for a general theme, then sub--themes and ideas, such as
where each idea begins and ends, and how it is sustained. Search for the
principal themes and the logical order of each sub--idea; then, when you
see another principal/primary theme, you can place it in the next
category or section.\"

\"An outline is basically an aid to help lay out the precepts and
reasons of your sermon in a systematic, easy to use and easy to read
structure.It helps you as the preacher and others as the hearers to
identify the general ideas and key thoughts of your sermon. The basic
consideration is for you to define the main idea and then the
subordinate ideas. \"

## Main Thought: A structured outline typically uses a descending numbered structure to lay out information.

\"Supporting Concept: The numbers are in a logical indention and order
to indicate various levels of subsidiary interrelation (describing
precepts in a descending logical order from major idea to lesser points
from the main ideas).\"

Supporting idea: Look at it as a \"story arc\" from your Major Idea,
then thesupporting ideas, and in each subordinate idea category and the
further details thereof.

## How to Construct and Outline: Basically, you are making a framework with the following components (Main or General Idea):

# TEXT: The foundation of ANY sermon. What portion of Scripture are you preaching?

# THEME: Your sermon in one sentence. (Probably completed last in the sermon preparation process. Could include a \"Title.\")

INTRODUCTION:

An introductory paragraph PREPARING the hearers for what is to be said.

BODY:

## MAJOR POINT ONE

### SUB THOUGHT \"A\"

### SUB THOUGHT \"B\"

## MAJOR POINT TWO

### SUB THOUGHT \"A\"

### SUB THOUGHT \"B\"

## MAJOR POINT THREE

### SUB THOUGHT \"A\"

### SUB THOUGHT \"B\"

## CONCLUSION: Review, summarize, and or call to action. In the conclusion you could REMIND the hearers what has been said.

Outlining, like any new activity, will take practice. Be persistent and
do not get frustrated. It will take time and practice!
