</h2><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t438#' >Founded on the theme or topic of the text&#44; rather than on the words of the text.
</span>

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t439#' >The theme is most prominent in a topical sermon.
</span>

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t440#' >The divisions of the sermon are formulated by the preacher. (Which should be based on the theme)
</span>

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t441#' >The text should naturally suggest the theme.
</span>

</h3><h2> 
<span lang="en" id='t442#' >Advantages of the Topical Sermon
</span>

</h2><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t443#' >It allows for rhetorical perfection. (If the aim of preaching be to make the sermon a work of art&#44; let it be treated topically.
</span>

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t444#' >It allows for thorough examination of the theme. (A single text rarely does this.)
</span>

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t445#' >It trains the mind to breadth of view. (The spirit of the words is what we shouldaim to bring into the light&#44; and not just the bare words.)
</span>

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t446#' >A theme can be chosen first&#44; A text can then be selected&#44; Which supports that theme.

</h2><h3>

</span>

</h4><h4> 
<span lang="en" id='t450#' >ILLUSTRATIVE (Opportunity for illustrations&#44; &quot;stories&quot;.)
</span>

</h4><h4> 
<span lang="en" id='t451#' >CLIMACTIC (Rises to successive climaxes reaching to a well&ndash;defined conclusion.)
</span>

</h4><h4> 
<span lang="en" id='t452#' >PERSUASIVE (Ends with recapitulation&#44; application&#44; and earnestness.)
</span>

</h4><h5> 
<span lang="en" id='t453#' >The element of argument should be found in every sermon. Action should be our aim. The proposition must be proved to get proper action.
</span>

</h5><h5> 
<span lang="en" id='t454#' >Plain&#44; direct application should be found in every sermon. No sermon should lack application. No congregation should be deprived of application.
</span>

<span lang="en" id='t460#' >"Carefully go over the text to see what is going on&#44; the &quot;who&#44; what&#44; where&#44; when&#44; how&#44; and why.&quot;This will pull out facts through the nature of Scripture and help avoid presumptions and fallacies. Allow the Word of God to &quot;speak for Itself.&quot;"

</p><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t461#' >Read the Text in Its Context Several Times. For example&#44; if you are studying the Book of John&#44; begin with reading the whole book.
</span>

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t462#' >"Make sure you are going into your relationship with God's Word in ameaningful manner. If you start too hastily&#44; thinking you already know thepassage&#44; you will not gain the insights and depth because your haste will make waste."

</h3><h3>

</span>

</h4><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t470#' >"The chapter and verses were added by the publisher and are not part of the original text nor are they inspired. So&#44; donot constrain yourself to them.

<span lang="en" id='t471#' >Then List All Of the Various Ideas/Points in Sequence.
</span>

</h2><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t472#' >This is where you use &quot;Interpretation&quot;. This is taking what is said and finding out what the text means&#44; how to interpret literally in the correct context. 
</span>

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t473#' >This is where the supporting information and details go. This is called your Sub&ndash;Topic; these are commonly listed under the idea/topic with each piece ofinformation listed separately.

</h3><p>

</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t478#' >"In the narrative passages&#44; you will also find a logical order of events. However&#44; Hebrew literature does sometimes jump the points around. It is best just to stick to the text and in the opening&#44; summary&#44; or conclusion&#44; to draw attention to the general context. "
</span>

</p><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t479#' >There are normally two ideas of information that should be listed. If there is only one piece of information to support a sub&ndash;topic&#44; traditionally that information is included in the sub&ndash;topic.
