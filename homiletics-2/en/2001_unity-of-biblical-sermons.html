<span lang="en" id='t157#' >"What is the &quot;theme&quot;? "
</span>

</h2><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t158#' >The theme refers to the main subject of the sermon. It is the main thought or idea that is to be communicated to the people.
</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t159#' >The subject will answer the question:&quot;What am I talking about?&quot;
</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t160#' >The theme or subject is simply what the sermon is going to be about. What is the message that God has for the people? This one message or subject is what is called the theme. 
</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t161#' >The subject of a sermon should never be only one word.
</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t162#' >Single words are too vague to form a complete and concise subject. Single words like worship&#44; faith and love are too broad for a sermon subject. The subject needs to be narrowed down to form a complete thought. For example&#44; there are so many aspects of love that could be preached in a sermon. You need to know what part of love you intend to preach for one sermon. The theme should narrowly define the subject to be preached.
</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t163#' >Remember a rule: the text naturally suggests the theme. The theme should be drawn from the text that is to be preached. The Word should always be the foundation for the sermon.
</span>

</p><h2> 
<span lang="en" id='t164#' >"What is the &quot;thesis statement&quot;? "
</span>

</h2><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t165#' >This term is used to refer to the one complete sentence that will define the subject to be preached. It is the entire sermon described in one complete sentence.
</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t166#' >"The thesis statement completes the subject. "
</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t167#' >A subject can not stand alone. A subject needs a complement to be complete. A complete sentence needs both a subject and a predicate. The thesis statement will add a predicate to the subject. You need to know what you are going to say about your subject.
</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t168#' >The subject answers the question: What am I going to say?
</span>

</p><p> 
<span lang="en" id='t169#' >The thesis statement answers the question: &quot;What am I going to say&#44; about what I am going to say?&quot;
