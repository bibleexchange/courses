The Unity of Biblical Sermons (Having one theme)


</h1><p> 
Effective Communication of the Gospel demands a single theme.


</p><h2> 
"What is the "theme"? "


</h2><p> 
The theme refers to the main subject of the sermon. It is the main thought or idea that is to be communicated to the people.


</p><p> 
The subject will answer the question:"What am I talking about?"


</p><p> 
The theme or subject is simply what the sermon is going to be about. What is the message that God has for the people? This one message or subject is what is called the theme. 


</p><p> 
The subject of a sermon should never be only one word.


</p><p> 
Single words are too vague to form a complete and concise subject. Single words like worship, faith and love are too broad for a sermon subject. The subject needs to be narrowed down to form a complete thought. For example, there are so many aspects of love that could be preached in a sermon. You need to know what part of love you intend to preach for one sermon. The theme should narrowly define the subject to be preached.


</p><p> 
Remember a rule: the text naturally suggests the theme. The theme should be drawn from the text that is to be preached. The Word should always be the foundation for the sermon.


</p><h2> 
"What is the "thesis statement"? "


</h2><p> 
This term is used to refer to the one complete sentence that will define the subject to be preached. It is the entire sermon described in one complete sentence.


</p><p> 
"The thesis statement completes the subject. "


</p><p> 
A subject can not stand alone. A subject needs a complement to be complete. A complete sentence needs both a subject and a predicate. The thesis statement will add a predicate to the subject. You need to know what you are going to say about your subject.


</p><p> 
The subject answers the question: What am I going to say?


</p><p> 
The thesis statement answers the question: "What am I going to say, about what I am going to say?"
