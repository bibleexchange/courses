# PRINCIPLE NINE: LANGUAGE RULES MUST NOT BE IGNORED.

## \"All languages are not equal. As a matter of fact, each language is unique with its own strengths and weaknesses. The uniqueness of each language makes the study of it complex, but exciting! Greek and Hebrew are vastly different from each other and equally different from our modern languages. The peculiarities of the Biblical languages should be studied and understood even to interpret Scripture that is translated in our native tongue. \"

EXAMPLE 1: Christ\'s address to Mary in John 19:26 sounds a bit harsh in
English: \" Woman,behold thy son!\"As a matter of fact, it sounds very
derogatory in English. We interpret this passage not in light of how it
sounds in English, but how it sounds in the Greek because that is the
original and inspired language of the book of John and the Hebrew or
Aramaic because that is probably the language which Christ spoke In
Hebrew, \"woman\" has the opposite sound than that in English; it is a
term of respect such as \"madam.\"

EXAMPLE 2: Ephesians 5:18 cannot be completely appreciated in the
English. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled
with the Spirit; The word \"excess\" is a translation of the Greek
\"asotia\" Asotia is a compound word meaning \"no salvation.\"
Understanding the Greek sheds great light on the meaning of this
passage.

## \"Looking up the meaning of words in a dictionary can help the preacher gain a better understanding of the Scripture. The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew and the New Testament was originally written in Greek. There are reference books available such as the Strong\'s Concordance and the Vine\'s Expository Dictionary. These books give the meaning of words in theoriginal languages. The use of a regular language dictionary like Webster\'s can also help in understanding the meaning of words in the Scripture passage.\"

## \"EXAMPLE: The word \"servant\" in Romans 1:1 is doulos in the original Greeklanguage and it means a love servant or one who chooses of his own free willto be a servant. Paul was not orced to be a servant of Jesus, but rather chose to be a servant of Christ because of his great love for the Lor Looking up the meaning of the word servant helps you to understand the right meaning of the passage.\"

\"Also, consideration must be given to the age of the translation in
your own language. Words within a language have the habit of evolving
and changing in meaning over time and even meaning completely opposite
to their original meaning. Since its translation in 1611,the KJV has
stood as giant among Bible translations. But, in the past 400 years
approximately 800 English words in the KJV have now changed in meaning
or are no longer in common usage at all!\"

EXAMPLES:

-   SUFFER in Exodus 22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
-   LETTETH in 2 Thess. 2:7 he who now letteth will let
-   GAY in James 2:3 have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing
-   WIMPLES in Isa 3:22 and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
-   WIST in Mark 9:6 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore
    afraid.

\"As a result, there often are fine shades of meaning in English that do
not exist in the original text. For instance, \"royal\" means \"having
to do with royalty\". \"Regal\" gives the mental image of \"in a
grandiose manner, with lots of pomp and circumstance\". Often, an
English translator has no choice; he must choose between English words
that have more precise meanings than the original language because there
is no equivalent \'broad\' word in English. In making his choice he is
not only translating the text, he is also changing the meaning to a
certain extent. For instance, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
all wisdom.\" The Hebrew word is half--way between\"dread\" and
\"reverence\". No English word exists that has the exact same meaning.\"

Interpretation of text includes study of jargon unique to the subject
matter of the text.
