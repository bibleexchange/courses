PRINCIPLE THREE: THE LITERAL INTERPRETATION IS MOST USUALLY THE BEST.


</h1><h2> 
All Scripturemust be taken in its literal and obvious sense allowing only for symbolismand figures of speech.


</h2><h2> 
Every passagemust be taken at face valu Martin Luther called this principle "literalinterpretation."


</h2><h2> 
This principlesmeans that we read and evalueate Scripture with the same honesty andunderstanding that we read any book. 


</h2><h2> 
Let scripture speak for itself. 


</h2><h2> 
Situation Hermeneutics.' Truth is absolute and not relative to your scenario.


</h2><h2> 
This principle has special relevance in the study of prophecy. The Old Testament contains about 450 prophecies concerning the first coming of Christ. Many of these prophecieswere duplicates, at least sixty distinct facts of Christ's life and ministrywere predicted, and all sixty, without exception, were literally fulfilleProphecy that is not literally fulfilled and I not true prophecy.


</h2><h2> 
Ask thequestion: What concepts NATURALLY flow from the text? The plainmeaning read it the way it was written.(There is great wisdom in simplicity.)
