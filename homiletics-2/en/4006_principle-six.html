<span lang="en" id='t699#' >One method of correct interpretation is to compare verses in the Bible with other Bible verses. One Scripture will help to interpret another Scripture. The Bible will never contradict itsel The Bible is in complete harmony with itself from Genesis to Revelation. (In Homiletics I we discussedthe value of comparing Scripture with Scripture.)

<span lang="en" id='t700#' >Compare Scripture texts on the same subject. Comparing Scripture texts on the same subject will help you to better understand that subject. You will be able to glean a full understanding of the subject from the Word of God.

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t701#' >"Compare how the same word is used in different Scriptures. A good way to understand the meaning of a word is to seehow that word is used in the context of different Scripture passages. Looking at a word in context of various passages will help you to understand the meaning of the word. You want to make sure you are comparing the same original language word in one verse to that same original language word in another verse For example the word suffer in Mt&#44; 3:15 is aphiemi which in this context means to let it be or to allow; but suffer in Mk. 8:31 is paschowhich means to hurt or feel pain. Obviously&#44; a comparison of these two words for &quot;suffer&quot; would not give you a proper meaning of the original word. Also keep in mind the comparison of OT words to NT words. It can be very helpful to compare the OT with the NT&#44; but you must remember that you are dealing with different languages so an exact original word comparison is not possible."

</h2><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t703#' >The Word of God is in perfect unity in relation to itself. The verses in one Book of the Bible will explain the truths found in other verses of the Bible.

</h3><h3> 
<span lang="en" id='t704#' >"One Scripture will help to shed light on another Scripture and thereforehelp you to understand the correct meaning of the Bibl For example Daniel chapter 7 contains the vision of the four beasts. Verse 17 of this chapter tells us that these beasts are four kings that shall arise out of the earth. The later verse gives the interpretation of the earlier verses. And a further comparison of Revelation 13:2 shows us the first three beasts combined into one beast. Daniel 7:7&#44;19 explain that the fourth beast is terrible and different from the rest. The fourth beast of Daniel and the beast of Revelation 13 represent the one world kingdom of the anti&ndash;christ. All of the end&ndash;time world powers combined into one world government. You will cover these passages in Prophecy class. The only way to glean a full understanding of these passages is to compare them to each other. One passage helps to explain the other passage. Scripture is not subject to private interpretation. "

<span lang="en" id='t706#' >"One Bible study method is to compare Scripture with Scripture. The Bible instructs us to compare spiritual things with spiritual things. By comparing verses with each other the Bible will be better understood. The Word of God will fit together like the pieces of a puzzle. One Scripture will interpret another Scripture. The Bible is in complete harmony with itself. There are no contradictions in the Bible. What God has written in Genesis will be in agreement with what God has written in Revelation."
