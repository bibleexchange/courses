# The Conclusion

The conclusion is the end of a sermon, but is not merely the point where you say you are done, but is perhaps the most important part of the sermon. It is so important because it is an intense time of decision for the hearers. The conclusion should include a call to action. The question, “What should be said in the conclusion?” is answered by answering another question, “If the congregation were to leave forgetting everything that I have said in my sermon except for one thing, what would I want that one thing to be?” The answer to that question should be your conclusion. There are at Least Three Kinds of Sermon "Conclusions."

## The Summary Conclusion

One Possible Goal for Your Conclusion Could be To summarize the core ideas of your sermon.

If you preach for any length of time most of what you have said will be forgotten by your listeners. You can use your conclusion to remind the listeners of the most important thoughts of your sermon. Do not leave anything to chance, but tell your listeners what they should remember.

## The Relative Conclusion

A Second Possible Goal for Your Conclusion Could be To relate the core ideas of your sermon to your listeners.

This use of a conclusion, assumes the listeners remember well enough what was said, but need to be shown how what was said relates to them. You can try to answer the question, "I have heard what you said, but why does it matter to me?" Seek to cause the listeners to know that God is speaking to them personally and not just their neighbor.

### Conclusions that Propose specific procedures

### Conclusions that apply ideas to audience interest

## The Challenging Conclusion

A Third Possible Goal for Your Conclusion Could be To Challenge your listeners to respond to your sermon.

Action is the goal of the challenging conclusion. This use of your conclusion seeks to challenge your listeners to action. Assuming they remembered what was said and know God is speaking to them and not just somebody else, you seek to inspire them to respond to the sermon with action. An example of this could be giving an altar call to sinners and calling them to repent and pray to God without delay. The action that is challenged to in this type of conclusion is that the sinners would PRAY to God and be born again.
