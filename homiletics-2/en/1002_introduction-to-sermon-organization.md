# Sermon Organization

# INTRODUCTION

"Outlining" is taking what we have learned in our study of the Scripture and then laying it out in an orderly and efficient way so we can understand it and explain it better. Outlining will enable the preacher and teacher to impart knowledge to others in a more profound and impacting way. Remember that Scripture is the source of Christian teaching; all we do is tap into it and pour out God's most precious precepts for all to drink.

"Why Should We Make an Outline? Organization is very important to the communication of the Gospel and outlines are essential tools of organization. There are no shortcuts to good Biblical preaching. Outlining will be your primary means of producing quality, Bible--centered lessons, talks, and sermons."

"There are three major kinds of sermons Expository, Textual, and Topical. It could be said, and logically so, that the textual and topical sermons are merely variations of the expository sermon. "

### There are important elements of preaching which make the preacher effective in his goal of persuasion

There are different types of sermons that are effective in different settings:

1. Textual—The text gives the theme, title and divisions. The divisions are suggested by the prominent words of the text.

2. Topical—Founded on the theme or topic of the text.

<!--3. Textual-Topical—The sermon is treated textually and expressed topically.

4. Textual-Inferential—The sermon is drawn from inferences out of the text.-->

5. Expository—The sermon exposes or explains the text in its richness of meaning.

There are different types of subjects that can be preached:

1. Doctrinal—Instructional preaching of Bible doctrine (II Tim. 4:2).

2. Historical—Setting the historical scene of a Scripture passage (Telling the story). Relating of history to inspire faith (Great revivals).

3. Biographical—Preaching on Scriptural persons and great people of God.

4. Exegetical—An explanation or thorough examination of the text.

5. Prophetical—Show how prophecy has been fulfilled. Scripturally unfold God's plan for the future.

### A sermon should be outlined and have a structured, logical order of thought

You must know where you are going and lead on a path that your hearers can follow!

#### Text

Draw the sermon out of a text. Preach the Word!

#### Title

The name given to the sermon is called a title. Most of the time a title is extremely helpful in clarifying your topic to the hearers. Not every sermon has to have a catchy title like “Running for the Gold,” but your sermon direction needs to be communicated to the hearers near the start of the sermon. A title is the simplest way to tell the hearers, “This is the direction we are going in today.”

#### Theme

The theme is the main subject of the sermon. A sermon should not be scattered, unrelated thoughts going in every direction, but every thought should be united by a single theme or subject. Preaching is not stand-up comedy or story time, but is eternal business where the preacher waits on God for the message of the hour and then follows through to the best of his ability to communicate that single theme in his preaching. Do not preach your own thoughts, but preach the mind of God.

#### Introduction

Lead the congregation into the sermon. Do not ramble, but use the beginning moments to lay the foundation of the sermon. Lean wholly on the leading of the Holy Ghost that He would prepare the hearts and minds of the hearers to receive the message of the hour.

#### Body

The body of the sermon outline includes the meat and substance of the sermon expressed as main points. The sermon is built step by step in the body of the outline.

#### Conclusion

The conclusion is the end of a sermon, but is not merely the point where you say you are done, but is perhaps the most important part of the sermon. It is so important because it is an intense time of decision for the hearers. The conclusion should include a call to action. The question, “What should be said in the conclusion?” is answered by answering another question, “If the congregation were to leave forgetting everything that I have said in my sermon except for one thing, what would I want that one thing to be?” The answer to that question should be your conclusion.

## Expository sermons are those in which the subject, maindivisions and most of the details are derived from the text.

"The expository sermons is concerned with the "paragraph" instead of merely the verse. This form of sermon may be the surest route to proper interpretation and presentation of Scripture. Homiletics III will more thoroughly explore the expository sermon."

## Textual sermons are those in which the subject and main divisions are derived from the text.

"The Textual Sermon is a miniature Expository Sermon covering a few verses, a verse, or part of a verse, but not the whole paragraph. Even though the textual sermon covers fewer verses than the expository sermon, the subject does come from the Bible and each major point comes from those verses. Yes, there is less material from which to get the supporting material, but it still may be possible. The textual sermon is just a shorter form of the expository sermon and covers only a few verses, a verse or part of a verse, but still expounds that shorter portion of Scripture. The value of the textual sermon is in dealing with a manageable portion of Scripture appropriate for the present setting."

## Topical sermons are those in which the subject alone is derived from the text.

The preacher is instrumental in the organization of the topical sermon. His topic is derived from the text, but how the topic is treated is determined by the preacher.
