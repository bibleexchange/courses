## Sermon Organization

"Outlining" is taking what we have learned in our study of the Scripture and then laying it out in an orderly and efficient way so we can understand it and explain it better. Outlining will enable the preacher and teacher to impart knowledge to others in a more profound and impacting way. Remember that Scripture is the source of Christian teaching; all we do is tap into it and pour out God's most precious precepts for all to drink.

Why Should We Make an Outline? Organization is very important to the communication of the Gospel and outlines are essential tools of organization. There are no shortcuts to good Biblical preaching. Outlining will be your primary means of producing quality, Bible-centered lessons, talks, and sermons.
