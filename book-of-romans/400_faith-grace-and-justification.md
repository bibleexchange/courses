# Faith, Grace & Justification &mdash; Romans 4

JUSTIFICATION IS OF FAITH THAT IT MIGHT BE BY GRACE

## Introduction &mdash; &quot;Justification By Grace Through Faith&quot;

The role of the law in justification is that it brings the knowledge of sin.  A person is not justified through the works of the law. For justification takes place in the case of the Believer &quot;by grace through faith&quot;.

By Grace a gift of eternal life is freely offered to the entire world and it is through faith that gift is received. God made the first move in the plan of redemption and for that plan to be effective in me, I must choose to receive that gift through faith. (God&apos;s grace is resistible by the nature of the free will given by God to man.)

> Ephesians 2:8&mdash;For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

> Romans 4:16&mdash;Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all.

Justification by Faith is Demonstrated in the life of Abraham.

## I. Abraham was justified by Faith and not by Works. &mdash; Vs. 1&mdash;8

> Romans 4:3&mdash;…Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

### A. Paul is Addressing a Question of the Jews

#### 1. Why is Paul talking about Abraham?

##### a. The Jews Relate Deeply to Abraham

Abraham is referenced as &quot;our father&quot; in verses 1,12 and 17. Abraham was our Father as pertaining to flesh, the Father of circumcision, Father of our faith, and Father of nations (This was the promise of God to Him).

The Jews were holding to their relationship to Abraham (&quot;abraham&apos;s children according to the flesh&quot;) as their guarantee to eternal life. The Jews placed great confidence in Abraham the Father of their nation and it is the Jewish questions, Paul is addressing:

&mdash; What about Abraham our Father?
&mdash; What about the covenant of circumcision given to Abraham, doesn&apos;t that make us righteous?

##### b. What saith the Scripture?

> Romans 4:3 &mdash;For what saith the scripture? …

Romans chapter 4 deals with &quot;Abraham&apos;s Righteousness&quot;. Abraham is an example of justification by grace through faith.  Paul uses Abraham&apos;s life as recorded in SCRIPTURE to explain the doctrine of righteousness by faith. In both Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, Paul is bringing out the truth that he is not teaching a Gospel that is in competition with the Scriptures (Old Testament), but rather a Gospel that is a continuation of God&apos;s Eternal Purpose.

1. In chapter 3, Paul affirms that faith does not void the Law but rather establishes it.
2. In chapter 4, the promise given to Abraham was  not through the Law (circumcision) but through the righteousness of faith.

#### 2. What is the Question?

&mdash; **Question**:
What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? v.1

&mdash; **Answer**:
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. v.13

God is using the example of Abraham to explain to the Jewish Christians how men are justified&mdash;&mdash;declared righteous/just by God.

Paul was using the Scripture as the authority to refute the questions of the Jews. So should the Christian today look to the Word of God as the final authority in settling questions.

### B. Before the Torah was Given, Abraham was counted as righteous! vs. 1&mdash;4

Moses who was esteemed by the Jews as the writer of the Torah is called as a witness to the justification of Abraham by faith.

> Genesis 15:6 &mdash And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.

This is a passage the Jews would have been well familiar with. Paul is using their own Scriptures to preach to the Jews justification by faith. The word counted carries the same meaning in Hebrew as it does on Greek. Righteousness was put to his account by faith. This is the meaning of Justification.

Before the Torah was given to Moses and long before Moses was even born, Abraham was justified by faith the same way the Christians are today. God gave Abraham a promise; he believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

> Romans 4:4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.

What does God OWE humanity? Judgment. Keeping the Law does not obligate God to justify the sinner. It is a gift and it is by grace not &quot;debt&quot;.

### C. God justifies the ungodly. v. 5

Those who are not born&mdash;again are sinners and ungodly. The repentant sinner is declared righteous by God through the blood of Jesus. The ungodly do nothing to earn their salvation. They are justified &quot;by grace alone through faith alone&quot;.

NOTE: God requiring faith does not cancel God&apos;s grace. A justification conditional by works is in competition with the grace of God which is His goodness extended only for the reason that God is good. The condition to justification is a response of faith. Faith is absolutely required and our justification is still to the glory of God as it He Who has given to us the gift of faith with which we may respond to His grace. Justification is  by grace and is conditional: by grace through faith.

### D. David&apos;s Testimony vs. 6&mdash;8

Paul brings testimony from David to support the message of justification by faith.

David was esteemed by the Jews as their great king. This quotation from the Psalms confirms that men are only justified by faith and not works.

> Psalms 32:1&mdash;2&mdash;A Psalm of David, Maschil. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.

David was thanking God that His sin was forgiven and the sin was not put to his account. If sin was not imputed to him and his sin was forgiven this means he was restored to a right relationship with God.

Justification is the Divine action of being placed in a right relationship with God. David did not earn justification, but it was received by faith.

## II. Abraham was justified by Grace and not Circumcision. &mdash; Vs 9&mdash;17

The Jews looked to circumcision and the Law as their source of righteousness. Abraham was justified before he received the covenant of circumcision. He was counted as righteous in chapter 15 and he was 86 in chapter 16 when Ishmael was born.  Genesis 17:24 records Abraham was circumcised when he was 99 years old. It is quite clear that he was justified before he was circumcised. This passage is telling the Jews that Abraham was counted as righteous before he received the covenant of circumcision.

Circumcision did not justify Abraham. Circumcision was given as a sign of the promise. It was given as a seal of the righteousness of faith. It is a symbol of the cutting away of the flesh. There is no power of righteousness in a physical action. This is merely a sign of the work of God in much the same way that baptism is a sign of a completed work.

Abraham was counted as righteous by Grace totally separate from the Law. He was justified before the Law was given. This is further indication that he could not have been justified by the Law.

Abraham could not have earned any justification through keeping the Law since it had not yet been given to Moses. The Jews put so much emphasis on the Law; Paul is showing them that the Law had nothing to do with Abraham being counted as righteous.

The Law gives knowledge of sin. &mdash; V.15 For where there is no law there is no transgression refers to the fact that if there were no law then there would be no law to break. This also must have reference to the moral law as well as Moses Law.
Abraham was justified by faith through grace. V.16 If he was not justified by the works of the law then the only alternative is that he was declared righteous by the grace of God. He did not earn justification; it was given to him without merit because of his faith.

He received the promise that he should be the heir of the world through the righteousness of faith. &mdash; V. 13 The righteousness of faith is in reference to justification by faith. Justification is the declaration of righteousness by faith. Abraham did nothing to receive the promise; it was given to him by grace.

The promise was to make of him a great nation and from his seed would all nations of the world be blessed. &mdash; Gen. 12:1&mdash;3 This is a prophecy of the nation of Israel that would descend from Abraham. Even more important it is a promise of the Messiah that would come to provide salvation to all both Jew and Gentile.

The Jew looked for an earthly inheritance. In the minds of most of the Jews, the Messiah would overthrow the Romans and re&mdash;establish the nation of Israel. Paul is showing them the provision of righteousness available not just to the Jew, but to the entire world through Jesus the Messiah.

God will fulfill His PromiseVs.18&mdash;25

Abraham was given the promise of God. God promised Abraham he would have a son. Also, the Messiah would be a son of Abraham. Jesus fulfilled prophecy and was born according to his natural lineage as a descendant of Abraham.
Man has received the promise of justification by faith through Jesus Christ.
Abraham believed the promise of God. Against hope believed in hope.
	Abraham believed in the promise of God regardless of the circumstances. Sarah was about 90 and Abraham was more than 100 years old. There was no natural way possible for them to have a child. Abraham staggered not at the promise of God. &mdash; V.20
