## Will Be Glorified Through the Ministry of the Holy Ghost, vs. 26-30

### The Holy Spirit Helpeth Our Infirmities, v. 26

> 26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
 
The Holy Spirit is our Divine Helper.

Spirit - "pneuma" - a current of air, breath (blast) or a breeze
 
1. Prayer - (the Spirit Prays) is understood by God. We need a total dependance on the Spirit.
2. According to His Will - The Spirit knows how to pray.
 
### Jesus Our Intercessor, v. 27
 
>  27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.

"go between"

> "SILENT PRAYER" -- A friend of mine took his small son with him to town one day to run some errands. When lunch time arrived, the two of them went to a familiar diner for a sandwich. The father sat down on one of the stools at the counter and lifted the boy up to the seat beside him. They ordered lunch, and when the waiter brought the food, the father said, "Son, we'll just have a silent prayer." Dad got through praying first and waited for the boy to finish his prayer, but he just sat with his head bowed for an unusually long time. When he finally looked up, his father asked him, "What in the world were you praying about all that time?" With the innocence and honesty of a child, he replied, "How do I know? It was a silent prayer."

Hebrews 7:25; 1 John 2:1; 

> 1 Timothy 2:5&mdash;For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

### God's Purpose Wins!

>  28&mdash;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. 
 
God providentially cares for his people - "the called".

These called are not just "invited" but are "appointed, or a saint". Here "the called" are marked by the electing grace of God. "Called according to His purpose".  As God is sovereign, if God has a purpose ("fixed intention"), it will come to pass.

What is God's major purpose in the life of the Christian?

> 29&mdash;For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. 

Predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son.

God is the Creator, Landscaper, Planner, Builder, Cleaner, Finisher, Inhabitor (Lives in the heart of the Believer).

>30&mdash;Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: &hellip;

Called to be like God.

> 30&mdash;&hellip;and whom he called, them he also justified: 

Justified: Freed from Sin, positioned in Christ.

> 30&mdash;&hellip;and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

Eternal Glory. A glory revealed in us -- the Glory of God.

## Have God as Their Advocate, vs. 31-39

The end of the chapter deals with the Christian’s Hope, which is; “If God be for us who can be against us.”  And that we are more than conquerors and that all things work together for good. The sufferings we go through are to teach us our motives.

### The Accuser of the Saints

> 31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? 32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? 33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.  34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.  

1. Someone Must Produce Charges

In any legal process, a prosecutor must present his case. Who will bring the charges? "WHO can be against us?"

- Satan is against us Revelation 12:10
- The World is against us John 15:18-19
- False Witnesses - beware of men Matthew 10:17-19; Psalm 3:1

2. The Defense Presents their Case

- God is the Judge

But He also is our defense! v.31
- Justice demands satisfaction. 

If the law has been broken ("all have sinned") then justice demands punishment. Eze. 18:4, 20 === v. 34!

"ALL THINGS" v.32

1. Repentance Acts 5:31; 11:28; Romans 2:4; 2 Timohty 2:25
2. Forgiveness Psalm 103:3; Eph. 1:7; Co. 1:14; 1 John 1:9
3. Salvation Eph. 2:8
4. Life John 1:4; 10:10; Romans5:21; 2 Tim. 1:10
5. Joy Neh. 8:10; Isaiah 12:3; Romans 14:17
6. Healing Psalm 103:3; Isiah 53:5
7. Holy Spirit Acts 2:38; 5:32; James 1:6-7


3. The Judge Makes his Decision

> v. 33 "It is God that Justifieth

### The Power of God's Love

> 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.  37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.  38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,  39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
  
- The Nature of It - 1 John 4:8; Not a fickel love, but constant; 1 John 3:1 "manner" "strange" "foreign" "different"
- The Means of It- 1 John 4:9 -- He is the Mediator, God's love was manifested to us
- The Object of It  - John 3:16 -- US
- The Assurance of It - "I am persuaded"

Unaffected by the Extreme Conditions - Neither death nor life" Romans 14:8; Phil. 1:20,21

Unaffected by Spiritual powers - Nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, no one can come between you and God except you.

Unaffected by Time -- present or to come

Unaffected by life's circumstances -- nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature

More than Conquerors	

Complete Assurance (Confidence in God - Security)

### Six Question

1. What Shall We Then Say? (to these things)
2. If God be for us?
3. Shall he not freely
4. Who Shall lay anything to God's elect?
5. Who is he that condemneth (it is Christ that died)
6. Who Shall Separate Us

### 7 Things Tested

Tribulation, distress, persecution, famine nakedness, peril, sword

The Christian is in conflict and it is a battle of faith, patience, and morals.

### Knowing and Persuaded

Is there a difference between knowing something and being persuaded of something?

Persuaded -- knowing it versus be persuaded of it. a difference

Note: Paul in his experiences, had been through all the trials and tests.

Persuaded - His mind  his conscience and heart and whole being were sublimely committed to God. 

The Christian is a conqueror. Overcomes the enemy and gains by the conflict! Our victories increase our faith.

The Christian's secret is "through Him that loved us" 
- Not ourselves, but through Christ. But is not without effort. We are strong through Him not "Effortless".

## Conclusion

The two fold secret of Christian living is described by two phrases in verse 1 and verse 10. "in Christ Jesus" and "if Christ be in you"

The Christian's will is to live in Christ an life pleasing to God. The Holy Spirit dwells in us, empowering us to live such a life.
