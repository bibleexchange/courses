A. Walking after the Spirit is Liberty			Ch. 8
Romans chapter eight deals with our position in Christ.  We are free from sin and death. 
The law of sin brought bondage, but the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has worked great liberty!  OUR POSITION IN CHRIST is free from condemnation.
1. 8:10-16	Mortify the Deeds of the Body, Ye shall Live
2. 8:17-25	Hope of Adoption as Joint Heirs
3. 8:26-28	The Spirit Helps our Infirmities
4. 8:29-30 	The Hope of Glorification
5. 8:31-39	None Shall Stand Against Us, It is God that Justifies
The end of the chapter deals with the Christian’s Hope, which is; “If God be for us who can be against us.”  And that we are more than conquerors and that all things work together for good. The sufferings we go through are to teach us our motives.

Six Questions

(It is God that justifieth)                              8: 34	Who is he that condemneth?	(It is Christ that dies, and is risen again)                                       8:35	Who shall separate us?		(From the love of Christ)

                                                                                                                                  7.  Sword
Is there anything that can separate us from the love of God?
8:38 - 39	"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	
There is a difference between knowing something and being persuaded of it.
Persuaded - There is a difference between knowing a truth and being heart persuaded of it.
Paul in his experience, had been through all these trials and tests.
Persuaded - His mind, his conscience, his heart, his whole being, were sublimely committed into God.
"God is love," and the "Father loveth the Son," and those connected with Christ find themselves wrapped in the same eternal affection shown by God to His Dear Son.
CONCLUSION:
The 2-fold secret of Christian living is described by two phrases in verse 1 and 10 - "in Christ Jesus" and "if Christ be in you."
The Christian's will is to live in Christ a life pleasing to God.  The Holy Spirit dwells in us, empowering us to live such a life.
