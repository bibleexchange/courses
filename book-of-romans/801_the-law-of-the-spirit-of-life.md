To be in Christ is to be grafted into the True Vine. His life flows into us and what it is His is ours. God the Father views those in His Son as He views the only Begotten—heirs of God. In Christ, we do not struggle against the flesh and sin alone, and have not received alone the remission of sin, but have received Christ Himself. The Believer is in Christ and Christ is in them.

> Romans 11:16-18&mdash;For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. 17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  18 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.

 
## Those in Christ are No Longer Condemned, vs. 1-9

### No Condemnation for Those in Christ Jesus 

> vs. 1 &mdash; There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

The deliverance Paul cried for in 7:24 is announced in 8:1. The quality of life before regeneration of the religious has some gruesome parallels, but the new man in Christ experiences great liberty. No longer condemned to die as the man bound to the corpse, for there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

Sin brought bondage, but the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has worked great liberty! ** OUR POSITION IN CHRIST includes freedom from condemnation.**

The first of the most needed messages of the bible!!!
“the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death”                       Ro 8:1—There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.                                                                                                                       2—For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

There are three laws mentioned here.

1. The Law of the Spirit of Life

This law is greater than the law of sin and death. It is the life of Jesus imparted to the believer by faith. It is the law that makes you free from sin and death. Knowing the Truth of the law of the Spirit of life makes you free to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. Liberty is man’s born again state. Serving the Lord brings more abundant life. Every believer must manifest the Life of Jesus more and more unto Sonship.

2. The law of sin and death

It is like the law of gravity always pulling you down. It opposes that which is good and Godly. Brings you into bondage and condemnation. Bondage to sin makes you a servant to Satan. Serving the law of sin brings death.

3. The Law of God

It is Righteous, good and Holy. It opposes sin and the works of the flesh. It brings you to conviction and decision. The law being weak cannot save but can point the way to Christ. Obedience to the law is liberty but can only be done through Jesus Christ.

### Who Walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit

The Righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us through following Christ by the leading of the Holy Ghost

There are two ways to walk the path of life: 1) Following After the Flesh 2) Following After the Spirit of God. My will may not always be contrary to God&apos;s will, but to prioritize the flesh over the Spirit of God is the very recipe for failure. The carnal mind or the mind that is governed by that which is carnal is the very definition of rebellion against God. 

> vs. 7&mdash; Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

Those in Christ do things differently&mdash;both actions and thoughts. They walk/act following after the Spirit of God. Walking after the Spirit also includes minding the things of the Spirit. (v.5) To be spiritually minded is life and peace. The Spirit of God will govern us unto life, but the flesh will govern to death and self-destruction.

> Both in history and in life it is a phenomenon by no means rare to meet with comparatively unlettered people who seem to have struck profound spiritual depths while there are many highly educated people whom one feels are performing clever antics with their minds to cover a gaping hollowness that lies within.--Herbert Butterfield.

God knows what He is doing, Follow Him.

#### The Law of the Spirit of Life vs. The Law of Sin and Death

> vs. 2&ndash;3&mdash; For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

##### The  nature of the “Law of the Spirit of Life.”

1.	Provides justification where the old law only condemned.
2.	Works liberty where the old law only worked bondage.
3.	It is a stronger law doing what the old law could not do in its weakness. (SANCTIFICATION, HOLINESS, RIGHTEOUSNESS)
4.	Christ was been made flesh and identified with the sinful. The old law could only stand from a distance as a school master with a pointed finger.
5.	This law works righteousness in the Believer; the old law could only identify unrighteousness.
6.	This life is subject to the law of God, whereas the flesh is not and cannot be for it is an enemy of God--there can only be one master.

#####  The fulfilling of this “Life.”

1.	It is fulfilled in the one that walks not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
2.	Also, in those that mind the things of the Spirit, and not the things of the flesh. 
3.	It is pleasing to God, but they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
4.	If the Spirit of God dwell in you then His life is fulfilled in you, for you are no longer trying to serve God in the flesh, but have the Spirit of Christ to inspire and insure life.
5.	This life is not your own, but is Christ’s life. (Galatians 2:20)
6.	The fruit of this Life is righteousness. Your body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
7.	This Life is not debtor to the flesh, but to God to serve Him and obey Him.
8.	This Life is fulfilled in mortifying the deeds of the body.

### Who Mind the things of the Spirit and not the Things of the Flesh

> 5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. 6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. 7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. 8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. 


Romans 8:6  For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

The Lord be with you all.
●	Are we spiritually minded?
●	Or are we carnally minded?      (self motivated)
 Do our thoughts dwell on carnal things – the everyday needs – the daily grind –routine-schedule- performance-play-pleasure-the satisfying of our wants and desires?
Luke 10:40—But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.                                   41 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:  42 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
 Or are we truly spiritually minded?         (The Will of God)
❖	Is our mindset in tune with the Lord?
❖	Is our thinking in alignment with the Word of God?
❖	Is our walk right with God?

I.	Dwelling on the Word of God  -  Do our hearts dwell on the things in Ro. 8?

Rom. 8:1—There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.  
1.	No Condemnation to sentence you.                31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? 		no fear of accusation
2.	No Accusation to sway you

35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? …37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 	39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.			
3.	No Separation to stop you.		                                                                                                                                                                             We separate ourselves by not obeying the truth                                                                                                          8:1— “walk not after the flesh”                                                                                                                                        8:4— “walk not after the flesh”                                                                                                                                        8:5—“they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     8:6—“For to be carnally minded is death” 13— “ye shall die”                                                                                                             8:7—Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.                                                                                                                                                                                8: 8—So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.                                                                                   36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.     37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
4.	No defeat to slaughter or to slump you.

No intermission—“ all the day long” I Cor.15:30-31; 4:9-11; 2Co 4:10-11


### Ye are in the Spirit, if the Spirit is in You

> Ro 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.


I.	The Holy Ghost dwelling in you

 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.                                                                                                                                                                                 11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.                      2Co 6:16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
II.	Walking after the Spirit.
A.	Be obedient to the Word in all things
Ro 8:1—There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.                                                                                                                                             Col 3:16—Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.                      John 14:23—Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.                                                 15:7—If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
B.	Be subject to the Spirit in all things—FOLLOW                                                            
C.	Be led by the Spirit in all things—WALK WITH HIM
Ro 8:28—And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.                                                                                                                                 14:17—For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.                                                                                                                                                                                   14:19—Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
I.	Righteousness and Peace work together
A.	Through a Disciplined Prayer life		Ro 8:26,27
B.	Through  a Dedicated Mind
Ro 8:2—For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.   4—That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.                                                                                                                                               Ro 1:5—By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:                                                                                                                                                       16:26—But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:    2Co 10:5—Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
Romans eight sets forth that part in our salvation which is exercised by the third person of the Godhead, the blessed Holy Ghost.  Without Christ's work on the cross there would be no salvation, and without the presence and constant operation of the Holy Ghost, there would be no application of that salvation to us.
1.	V. Righteousness in life is possible through power of the Holy Ghost    Romans 8:1 - 11
8: 1   	 Now (justified - sin dealt with) there is no condemnation.                                                          8:2	We were condemned, but now FREE from condemnation in Christ Jesus.
In - (preparation) we are positionally in Christ                                                       Positioned - (in Christ) law of the Spirit                                                                                                   In old nature - law of sin and death
8:3	The law could not do many things.  It could not make men good.                                                                  8:4	The righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us.  We are not to walk after the flesh, but after the spirit.
8: 5-8	 Contrast of the carnal mind with that of the spiritual mind
a.	The carnal mind produces death
i.	Immoral, evil, violent, worldly, selfish and lust of the flesh
