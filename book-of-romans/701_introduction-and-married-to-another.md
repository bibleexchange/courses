# The Law Reigns over the Man Living in Sin – Romans 7

## Introduction

### Theme: 
The law with his prescription of condemnation has dominion over the man living in his sin. Righteousness in life is impossible through the works of the law as the sinner is bound to his sin. Romans chapter seven deals with Carnality and the sinners relationship (so long as he lives) to sin and death. This chapter also emphasizes that the Law of God is holy.

### Division: Three Sections:

- Verses 1 – 6: Died that You May be Married to Another
In the first section, God shows how those that were placed by Him under the law were released from that relation by sharing in the death of Christ; so that, joined to a risen Christ, they bear fruit; and released from law, they are glad and willing to serve Him.
The Apostle Paul reminds his Jewish brethren that the power of the law is terminated, and uses the illustration of a wife who has been freed by the death of her husband to marry another.  The main thought is death dissolves legal obligation and that on the death of her husband a wife is legally free to contract another marriage.

- Verses 7- 13: The Law is Holy, And Just and Good
Paul explains that sin’s dominion is not that the fault of the Law of God. The law is  good, but sin took advantage of him.

- Verses 14 – 25: Paul’s Captivity to the Law of Sin 
In the final section, we have Paul testifying of his struggle under the law as an Israelite, before he experienced the great truth that in Christ he was dead to the law and to sin.

## Dead that You May be Married to Another (vs. 1-6)

> Romans 7:1—Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?

### Meaning of the Illustration

The sinner is in a binding relationship to his sin as a wife to a husband. So, long as they both live, the husband and wife are bound to each other under God. As the wife is in submission to her husband, so the sinner is under the dominion of the law of sin.

Paul announces a death! The death of self in it being crucified with Christ opens a whole new world of opportunity. As the wife would be free from the law of her husband by death, so the sinner is freed from the law of sin through sharing in Christ’s death. This death is the crucifixion of the old man with Christ. ( Ac 13:38-39; Rom. 3:25; 5:21; 6:6; 7:4; 2Co 5:15; Gal. 1:4; 2:20; 5:24; 6:14; Eph 4:22; 5:2; Col 2:11; 3:5,9; Titus 2:14; Heb 9:15; 1Pe1:21; 4:2; 1John 2:2; 4:10)

Raised then in resurrection, we share in Christ’s life that we might be married to another. In this second marriage, we are united with Christ.

### The Power of the law is terminated

As long as a person is LIVING in sin they are under the law. The Sinner has no choice but to be under the law, except if he die to his sinfulness. The law dominates the sinner. The person that lives in sin is under the law

Death dissolves the legal obligation of the marriage. The sinner can be free from the power of sin and the penalty of the broken law.

> Romans 7:4—We must “become dead to the law by the body of Christ” 

<!-- -->

> Romans 6:14—sin shall not have dominion…ye are not under the law, but under grace.

#### Between the mind and the carnal works of the flesh.
#### Between my will and the old unregenerate self
#### Between my soul and sinfulness
### The Difference of the Union with Jesus Christ

1. “Know ye not “ The old life is baptized into His death 6:3
2. “Know ye not” The old service is broken off, destroyed through Christ. 6:16
3.  “Know ye not” The old union is impossible with the new union with Christ.  7:1

### The Service of the Union with Jesus Christ

From this union with Christ will come our service to Christ. 

> Romans 7:6&mdash; But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. 

#### Serve with newness of life	6:4
#### Serve in newness of Spirit	7:6
#### Serve with new power          Ro.1:16; 8:11; 1Co 6:14; 2Co 13:4; II Thess.1:11
#### Serve as a new creature     II Cor. 5:17; Gal.6:15

### The Fruitfulness of this Union

Union with Christ enables us to bring forth fruit.
 
#### Our union with sin disabled us unto death.

Rom.1:32; 6:21; 7:5; Gal.5:19-21

#### Union with Christ enables us to bring forth fruit of Righteousness unto Holiness.

- Under Sin

As long as a person lives in sin brings forth fruit unto death. 7:5

- With Christ

"fruit unto God"

Rom.1:13; 5:3-5; 6:22; John 15:2,4,5,8,16; I Cor. 1:6; Gal. 5:22-23; Eph 5:9; Php 1:11; 4:17; Col 1:6,10; Titus 3:14; Heb. 12:11; 13:15; James 3:18; 5:7; II Pe. 1:3-9

## The Law is Holy, And Just and Good (vs. 7-13)

In Romans 7:7-13, Paul establishes the goodness of God’s Law and the wickedness of sin. Paul is writing to the Jew, those who understand the law (vs.1), and properly frames the purpose and nature of the Law. Service to the letter of the Law cannot make one righteous, but in its exactness it awakens the sinner to his need of Christ. 

### Question: Is the Law Sin?

> Romans 7:7 ¶ What shall we say then? Is the law sin? 

Why Would Paul Ask this question? Paul had written in verse 6 that the law was something he was delivered from. This would seem to infer that the law is "bad".

> Romans 7:6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.

> ILLUSTRATION: Henry Ironside and the young indian man.

### Short Answer: No, The Law has a Good Purpose

> vs. 7 ... God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. 

The main theme of chapter seven is the believer’s relation to the law.  The believer is united with Christ “the new husband.”  When we are born we are bound to the law like as a marriage.  To be free from the law, because the law will never die or change we must die.  We become dead to the law by the body of Christ, which allows us to marry him that is raised from the dead, even Jesus Christ.  We are delivered from the law to serve God in the newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.

Serving in the oldness of the letter of the law did not make Paul righteous but rather exposed his unrighteousness, but it was not the cause of his sin. The Law, like a schoolmaster, taught him what was sin. By society's standards, Paul was not guilty unless he followed through on his lust, but the law communicated God's standards which by result exposed the depravity of his heart. "Thou shalt not covet" (v.7). How can I be told not to "want" something that is in my nature? The law requires exact and complete obedience without exception. In the light of the law of a Holy God, sin is utterly and completely exposed wherever it can be found. 

> Adam Clarke "His law is his will. It recommends what is just, and right, and good and forbids what is improper, unjust, and injurious. "

The law reveals the fact of sin	

> Colossians 3:5&mdash;Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:

<!-- -->

> I Thessalonians 4:5&mdash;Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:

What would be the results of a world without law? The law is representative of order, security, stability, faithfulness, uniformity, equality.  Absence of the law produces chaos, with its attendant evils. If the laws of nature were to stop what would be the results?  The End of the world.  

### Sin Brought Death

8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, 

-- A Starting Point, an opportunity

Paul personifies sin and in so doing abstracts sin from the person. The sword of the spirit is cutting a discerning division so that we might see we can be free from sin! If sin is characterized as a fiend waiting to pounce and take advantage of someone, then that someone can given the right situation, deny that sin. The murderer is within the sinner. But, if sin is merely the automatic reactions of nature, how can righteous judgment be made?

What was the opportunity that sin took advantage of? The law defines the sinner as DEAD in his sins. Being DEAD, the rebellion of sin takes advantage to work more death ... "wrought in me all manner of concupiscence."

### For without the law sin was dead. 

The Law is like a plumb-line: It shows where and what we are in the sight of God.  It is intended to awaken the sinner to his need for Christ. The Law then becomes the conductor to Christ in order that we may be justified by faith.

#### 9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. 

The law reveals the  power of sin. Under the law, a man becomes condemned to death because of sin.

Romans 7:5 describes the state of a Jew as in the flesh serving sin which considered as being under  law -- cursed.
      
Deuteronomy 27:26; 28:15; Ps 119:21; Jer 11:3; Ga 3:10
●	The curses were proclaimed principally to secure obedience to the commandments.
●	The curses were never meant to destroy the individual but produce repentance.

#### 10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. 

The end result for Paul was that he who vigorously followed the law and served it tenaciously, was dead in sin! All his religion was a work in unrighteousness--in light of the cross, all the commands of God were a sentence of death.

#### 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
 
The law reveals the deceitfulness of sin.   		     11

Sin takes advantage of us and deceives us,  The law of God is known in different ways: the ceremonial laws, the social laws, natural laws,  moral laws and health laws.

The Jews believed you had to keep all of those laws to become holy. By the time of Paul's ministry, the rabbis had summed up all of the Old Testament law into 613 commandments. It is impossible to keep them all, especially since they had strained at the laws beyond the intention of God.

The law reveals the effect of sin. The effect of all sin is a spiritual death. The outcome of dying physically with unrepented sin is eternal separation from God.
Through the inability to fulfill the law the sinner becomes condemned to death under the law.   A commandment cannot give life, but it can convict you of sin through the sentence of death and cause you to  repent and seek Eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

### 12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. 

The Law itself is "Holy and Righteous and Good"

- Holy because it discloses sin
- Righteous because it condemns the sinner
- Good because of its spiritual purpose (part of God's ultimate plan to bring man to himself)

##### 13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. 


##### But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; 


#### that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.

The law reveals the sinfulness of sin.	  	     12-13
- The Law is Holy, Just and good, so as the standard, the plumb-line, the commandment shows us where and what we are in the sight of God; sin is shown for what it is “exceeding sinful”. Far off from the mark that God has set for us in Christ.
- The law is intended to convict the sinner of sin and only through Christ find repentance.
- The law condemns, convicts, constrains and conducts an awakened sinner to Christ.   Rom. 3:19,23; 7:8-11; 8:3; Gal.3:19-24  ( Judge, warden, executioner, conductor)

Sin can hide in  society of men comparing one with another or else judging merely by the dictates of there own heart, but in the light of Perfect Holiness, sin becomes "exceedingly sinful".

## Paul’s Captivity to the Law of Sin  (vs. 14-25)


 Romans 7:14-25, Paul brings us to the root of the problem, the cause of our constant defeat by sin: our own flesh, the “body of this death” (verse 24).
Every believer is privileged, enabled and obligated to live a holy life. For those resting in the law, as sufficient for justification and sanctification, it is necessary to convince them of their error. The law is insufficient for justification but Grace and righteousness of  Jesus Christ is sufficient.  A believing Jew is discharged from his obligations to the ceremonial rituals of the law, and is at liberty to come under the Gospel of God through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, Ro 7:1-4.


The inability of the flesh  7:14 - 25

The key to the meaning of this entire section is found in the repetition of "I" thirty times in the chapter, without a single mention of the Holy Spirit.  It indicates what "I" am struggling to do, and utterly fail to do in my own strength.

NOTE:	In Chapter 7 the Law is mentioned 20 times
	In Chapter 8 the Holy Spirit is mentioned 20 times


### We see three confessions in this section of the Chapter:

#### The First Confession:  Verse 14, "For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."

	The 2 words in the Greek for carnal
	- one implying that which is purely material
	- the other implying that which is ethical

	The former suggests man's nature as weak.
	The latter suggests man's character as sinful.

#### The Second Confession:  Verses 18 - 20, "In my flesh swelleth no good thing."

	Here we see Paul describing a struggle.  In him so far as his person was carnal, there dwelt no good thing,
	though of course there was something more in him besides the flesh.


#### The Third Confession:  Verses 21 - 25,
	"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me."

	He is ever conscious of moral contraction and conflict within.  He has a desire to do good and yet an evil is
	always present.


### PARALLEL:

	On the one hand the inward man is delighted in God's law.  On the other hand he saw a different law in his
	members warring against the law of his mind and bringing him into a spiritual bondage.

NOTE:  	The "inward man" is not the same as "the new man", nor is the mind ever used of the renewed nature.
	It is the immaterial part of man.


### What are the 4 Laws mentioned in Verses 21 - 22?

	1.	Law of God - (moral law - written or unwritten)
	2.	Law of Sin - (reigns since fall of man)
	3.	Law of Mind - (moral sense of man)
	4.	Law of Members - (leads individual to falling under law of sin)

### CONCLUSION of Chapter 7:

#### Verse 24:	CRY OF AGONY AND CONFLICT

		"O wretched man that I am!  Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"

		The body of this death - what a fearful description of the body!  Unredeemed, unchanged, under the
		law of sin in all its members.  No matter what the "delight" of the quickened human spirit in the
		things of God may be, to dwell undelivered in such a body is to find it a "body of death".

#### Verse 25:	"I thank God, (for deliverance) through Jesus Christ our Lord"

(We need a renewed mind)


In summary, Paul discovered:

1.	That sin dwelt in him - though he delighted in God's law.
2.	That his will was powerless against it.
3.	That the sinful self was not his real self.
4.	That there is a difference through our Lord Jesus Christ.

ILLUSTRATION: Henry Ironside and young Indian man on Law and Grace

Some years ago, I had a little school for young Indian men and women, who came to my home in Oakland, California, from the various tribes in northern Arizona. One of these was a Navajo young man of unusually keen intelligence. One Sunday evening, he went with me to our young people's meeting. They were talking about the epistle to the Galatians, and the special subject was law and grace. They were not very clear about it, and finally one turned to the Indian and said, "I wonder whether our Indian friend has anything to say about this."

He rose to his feet and said, "Well, my friends, I have been listening very carefully, because I am here to learn all I can in order to take it back to my people. I do not understand all that you are talking about, and I do not think you do yourselves. But concerning this law and grace business, let me see if I can make it clear. I think it is like this. When Mr. Ironside brought me from my home we took the longest railroad journey I ever took. We got out at Barstow, and there I saw the most beautiful railroad station and hotel I have ever seen. I walked all around and saw at one end a sign, 'Do not spit here.' I looked at that sign and then looked down at the ground and saw many had spitted there, and before I think what I am doing I have spitted myself. Isn't that strange when the sign say, 'Do not spit here'?

"I come to Oakland and go to the home of the lady who invited me to dinner today and I am in the nicest home I have been in. Such beautiful furniture and carpets, I hate to step on them. I sank into a comfortable chair, and the lady said, 'Now, John, you sit there while I go out and see whether the maid has dinner ready.' I look around at the beautiful pictures, at the grand piano, and I walk all around those rooms. I am looking for a sign; and the sign I am looking for is, 'Do not spit here,' but I look around those two beautiful drawing rooms, and cannot find a sign like this. I think 'What a pity when this is such a beautiful home to have people spitting all over it -- too bad they don't put up a sign!' So I look all over that carpet, but cannot find that anybody have spitted there. What a queer thing! Where the sign says, 'Do not spit,' a lot of people spitted. Where there was no sign at all, in that beautiful home, nobody spitted. Now I understand! That sign is law, but inside the home it is grace. They love their beautiful home, and they want to keep it clean. They do not need a sign to tell them so. I think that explains the law and grace business."
