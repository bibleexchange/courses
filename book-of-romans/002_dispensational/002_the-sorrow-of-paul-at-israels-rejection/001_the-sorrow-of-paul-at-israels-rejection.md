# The Sorrow of the Apostle at Israel's Rejection (9:1-5)

Romans chapter nine talks about Paul&apos;s sorrow for the Jews. We find out that not all of Abraham&apos;s seed were the children of promise. 

> Romans 9:7,8&mdash;&hellip; Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.

This chapter talks about the calling of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews, as it had been foretold.

## The Sincerity of his feeling (1)

**Paul preached the truth! ** His Sorrow for the Lost was Sincere and Divinely Inspired.

1. Truth should be spken always
2. Truth is the Believer's Life (John 8:32)
3. Truth honors the Christ we serve.
4. Truth must be obeyed (Gal. 3:1)
5. Truth is necessary for growth. (Ephesians 4:14-15)
6. Truth is a defense.
7. We are begotten by the Truth. (James 1:18; 1 Peter 1:23
8. We are to Walk in the the Truth (II John 4)

## The Intensity of his feeling (2-3a)

**Paul carried the burden!** His Sorrow was intense - Great heaviness, Continual, Self-Sacrificing

Paul has experienced great heaviness in sorrowing over Israel&apos;s condition as a whole. Paul comes to the place that he would even be willing to be accursed from Christ that his brethren might be found in Christ. This is a selfless declaration, but the proposition is not even possible. The sinner&apos;s light in their darkness is the justified, sanctified, holy life of Believers that walk consistently in Christ and their own salvation is in Christ alone. 

Paul&apos;s proclamation is reminiscent of Moses in Exodus 32:32,33.

> Exodus 32:32,33&mdash; Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.

## The Basis of his feeling (3b-5)

Paul has great sorrow for unbelieving Israel. Their unbelief is especially disheartening as they remained in their unbelief despite their great spiritual heritage. 

Paul lays out the Jews spiritual heritage as being eight-fold. To the Jew Pertains:

1.   **ADOPTION** - privilege of adoption  -  sonship 

God had chosen Israel over Ishmael. ... The Jewish legend of Isaac and Ishamael's argument over circumcision ...

2.   **GLORY** - Shekinah presence of God

3.   **COVENANTS** - Promises of God made to Israel

4.   **LAW** - Law given at Sinai

5.   **SERVICE** - Authorized worship as ordained by God

6.   **PROMISES** - Promise of God are (yea and amen) to them that believe

The Jew had the promises of God, they even trusted in the law but they overlooked Christ.

7.   **FATHERS** - Relationship to the Father (Fathers of the flesh)

8.   **MESSIAH OF ISRAEL**

The written word  Rom. 3:2  oracles of God committed unto them. Rom. 9:5  Christ came in the flesh

There are over 400 prophecies concerning Christ in the Old Testament that were fulfilled in the New Testament.

Christ is a rock of stumbling to the Jew.

> Galatians 5:6&mdash;For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

John 14:15; 1 Peter 2:7,8

## The Righteousness of his Feeling

Paul makes it clear that his intense and sincere desire is all Israel be saved (Romans 9:1-5; 11:26; 10:1)

God desires that all sinners be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9; Ezekiel 18:23; Matthew 23:37).

> 1 Timothy 2:4&mdash;Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

Paul is righteous in his desire and not contrary to mind and will of God.
