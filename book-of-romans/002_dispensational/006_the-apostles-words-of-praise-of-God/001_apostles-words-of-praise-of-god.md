## The Apostle's Words of Praise of God (11:33-36)

> Romans 11:33-36&mdash; 33 Â¶ O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
 34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
 35 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
 36 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

> Matthew Henry: "A solemn adoring of the wisdom, goodness, and justice of God."
