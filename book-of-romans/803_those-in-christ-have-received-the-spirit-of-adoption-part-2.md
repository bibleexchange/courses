Completed Righteousness, the redemption of our body. BECAUSE OF ADOPTION     8:12 - 23

8:14	"For as many as are led by the spirit"    “led” (controlled) by the spirit.                                        Divine Guidance is the scriptural evidence of Maturity and Sonship.
There is a difference between Divine guidance and natural reasoning, circumstances or impressions.
		Sons of God - "Sons" means adult sons - sons come of age

Two total separate  spirits are contrasted in 8:15
8:15	1.	We have not received the spirit of bondage.       No longer under the law.
	2.	"We have received the spirit of adoption."
8:14-30 Adoption
We are introduced here to a deeper concept which is adoption, the manifestation of the sons of God. We understand that every man is BORN into the family of God, so what is this adoption all about? Adoption has to do with placing the fully matured and fully developed into Sonship. This thought combined with the manifestation of the sons of God speak of God’s ultimate plan in salvation. He is desirous to have many sons like His only Son. We often refer to this plan as End Time Salvation. 
End Time Salvation

End Time Salvation is God’s plan of salvation in its totality, salvation to the uttermost, of the whole man—body, soul, and spirit—which in time past was not an available provision because of the appropriateness of time. It is now made available to us living in the end times (or, the time of the end).
It is communicated throughout Scripture through many different thoughts. Listed below are some of the thoughts included in End Time Salvation: 
End Time Deliverance                Full salvation           Apolutrosis: Complete State    of Release

1Peter 1:4—To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,  5—Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
Ephesians 4:13—Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

Mat.6:33; Mk. 4:20; Ro. 8:15-23; Eph. 1:13, 14; Colossians 1:22; Hebrews 7:25; Rev. 3:21; 19:7



I Peter 1:5—Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. (The signs surround us; we are in the “last time.”)

I Corinthians 2:10 “But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.”

I Peter 1:10-12 “Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
    Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.”
Hebrews 11:39,40 “And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.”
Luke 21:28 “And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.” (Apolutrosis)

8:16	"Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit."                                                                                        The Holy Spirit and our spirit communicate.      "We are the children of God"
Children in the natural grow up together as a family; Parents address them as children.
