# Christian Subjection &mdash; Ch. 13

## Overview of Chapter 13

- Romans chapter thirteen talks about our duty to the state and the law, also the duties of citizenship. 

- We see that love is the fulfilling of the law.
- We need to make no provision for the flesh.

> Verse fourteen says; &quot;But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lust thereof.&quot;

James Strong defines subject this way: to subordinate; reflexively, to obey:--be under obedience (obedient), put under, subdue unto, (be, make) subject (to, unto), be (put) in subjection (to, under), submit self unto.

If we are to receive of the promise of Psalm 47:3 (He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.) then we are going to have to learn to be in subjection our selves—to God and to his delegated authorities. 

Let us explore "Christian Subjection" (subjection to rulers as ordained of God) in Romans chapter thirteen.

## The Bounds of Our Subjection, vs. 1

> Romans 13:1&mdash;Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

Having concluded chapter 12, which emphasizes the presenting of our bodies as a living sacrifice, Romans 13 teaches on the importance of subjection to authority.

Paul follows the command for subjection immediately with a foundational truth: 

> &hellip;For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

- All power belongs unto God. 
 
> 1 Peter 5:10&mdash;But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. 11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
<!-- -->
> Psalms 62:10&mdash;Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them. 11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. 12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
<!-- -->
> Isaiah 26:4 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:
<!-- -->
> Matthew 19:26&mdash;But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.
<!-- -->
> Psalm 29:10&mdash;The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.

- For their to be an earthly power, it has to have received its influence from the Sovereign God. 

> Colossians 1:16,17&mdash;For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: 17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
<!-- -->
> Psalm 90:2&mdash;Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
<!-- -->
> Daniel 2:21&mdash;And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:

**We are bound by God to be in subjection to authority. This mandate comes from God.**

## The Temptation of Our Subjection, vs 2

> Romans 13:2&mdash;Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

With all power belonging unto God, it is truly to God that our subjection is required.

The constant temptation of subordination is to resist authority. The
carnal mind doesn't like being told what to do, but we must <i>put
it (our will) under</i> the &quot;higher powers&quot; and ultimately the will of God.

- "subject" &mdash; to subordinate; to obey:--be under obedience (obedient), put under, subdue unto, (be, make) subject (to, unto), be (put) in subjection (to, under), submit self unto. 

- "resist" &mdash; to range oneself against, i.e. oppose:--oppose themselves, resist. 

To oppose God is to oppose ourselves. We do not hurt God when we disobey as so much as we hurt ourselves.

- "receive to themselves damnation" Romans 13:2
- Are caught in a snare of the devil. 2 Timothy 2:25

> 2 Timothy 2:24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, 25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.

## The Reasoning of Our Subjection, v. 3-5

Why should a Christian be in subjection to earthly authorities? 

Authorities in Power - (Constituted authorities) Authorities ordained of God into whose hands God has committed external human government. (External as opposed to inward, spiritual which lies outside Caesar's providence)

## For Wrath's Sake, vs. 3,4

> Romans 13:3,4&mdash;For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: 4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

Rebellion has a great price. Damnation is what Paul presents as rebellion&apos;s
cost. This same Greek word, &quot;krima&quot; , is also translated
&quot;condemnation&quot; and &quot;judgment&quot; throughout the New Testament.
Rulers bear a sword, but not for the subject but for the evil. The sword speaks of judgment.

There is no terror for the subject for rulers are ordained by God as a terror to good works but to the evil. Avoid the wrath of their sword. 

> Romans 12:18&mdash;If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.

<!-- -->

>  Hebrews 12:28&mdash;Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:

## For Conscience's Sake, vs. 5

> Romans 13:5&mdash;Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

God ordains authority for the purpose of defending good and disciplining evil. Authorities	are designed for our own good and protection. Without leadership only disorder and chaos can arise.

We should be in subjection not just to avoid punishment, but also to preserve our own clear conscience. (e.g., Consider jaywalking--crossing a street without using the cross walk. Now imagine someone's child following your example of unsafely crossing a street. Second, e.g., Wearing a seat belt in a vehicle.) Not every law should be weighed as if I'm measuring the risk. For the Christian, God commands us to be in subjection.

> Acts 23:1&mdash;And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.

## The Objects of Our Subjection, vs. 6-10

> Romans 13:6-&mdash; For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 7 ¶ Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. 8 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. 9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

### Pay Tribute - A Christian in Society

**"Render what is due"**

> Matthew 22:21&mdash;They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.

	- What if an Authority is demanding more than "what is due?"
	- Is it ever right to disobey?
	- Civil authorities? Government

The principle consistent in Scripture is that so long as "CAESAR" is not requiring what is God's than we are to remain in subjection. As much as it is possible, we are to live peaceably.

Perhaps 4 or 5 years before Paul writes this epistle to the Romans, There was a decree put out by Roman government that made it illegal for Jews (and by extension, Christians) to remain in the City of Rome. The justification for this decree stemmed from popular gossip that Jews were troublemakers. 

Paul does not address the "civil rights" of the Jews and Christians in this chapter, but emphasizes instead, their own responsibility. This is some heavy medicine.

### God&apos;s Ministers &mdash; 

They do not act of their own, but represent God and his authority.
		
### The Law and Love &mdash; 

Love fulfills the law. Being subject to love is to fulfill the law. Jesus said in:  

> John 14:15 &mdash; If ye love me, keep my commandments.

In Verses 6 & 7, what illustrations are given of submission to civil authority?

1.	Tribute to whom tribute is due
2.	Custom to whom custom
3.	Fear to whom fear
4.	Honor to whom honor

In what way does a Christian's responsibility extend beyond paying his financial obligations to the government?

- First, we are told to owe no man anything
- Second, love one another

Notice it is love and not law doing which is the fullness of law. Love, therefore, is shown to be the fullness (not the fulfilling) of the law.

In Verse 9 we see some of the commandments listed, but what is the outstanding one?

Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself

NOTE: It is only those not under law that are free to love others. Love is the active principle of Christianity.

How does the principal of love fulfill the law?

Verse 10:	"Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."

The believer is in a "new creation", and is to walk by that infinitely higher "rule of life" (Gal. 6:15-16) and not by law. In loving he has fulfilled the lower law.

### The Lord Jesus Christ &mdash; 

Ultimately all authority must give account and subjection to the Lord, Master, Jesus Christ. He is over all.

It is only by the putting on the Lord Jesus Christ as a positive attitude of the soul that we shall find ourselves able and willing to refuse any provision for the flesh.

We see the full title Lord Jesus Christ: 

- Lord - He is over all things
- Jesus - Personal name
- Christ - the anointed one

## The Urgency of Our Subjection, vs. 11,12

> Romans 13:11-12&mdash; 11 ¶ And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. 12 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
 
We are running out of time before what? 

The Lord promises to return, but when He comes will He find faith in the earth? 

> Luke 18:8&mdash; tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

## The Quality of Our Subjection, vs. 13,14

> Romans 13:13,14&mdash; 13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. 14 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

### Our Walk

Honestly as in the Day and it is not us that live, but it is Christ that liveth in us. We must put on the Lord Jesus Christ. Clothe ourselves with His righteousness. This must mean death to the flesh; making no provision for it.

Our self-life must be conquered, before we can show someone else the Romans road.
Every student, Christian must have a purpose, or vision, else we will fail. This is something that Christ will give us.

What are three areas of wrong doing are described in verse 13?

1.	Rioting and Drunkenness
2.	Chambering and Wantonness
3.	Strife and Envying

(1) A vision given (2) a plan of action, to obtain that vision, [not our plans of attaining his will, but getting his plans, to attain his will / "God's Will Done God's Way"]

It is a process of learning, to overcome the old man.

> John 4:34 — …My meat is to do the will of him that sent me…

### Our Work or God's Work

This is not our work, but his work — And our work is do the will of Him that called us, do his work.

If we are called, than we have a purpose to be reveled to our lives; this revelation of God's purpose for our life is received through prayer.

As ministers you are required to bring others to the knowledge of Christ; So that they seek the word of God for themselves. (The woman at the well, she believed because of what the word said)

A bond-servant of Jesus Christ is to point others to Christ, and never to themselves. 

Prayer not only equips us for greater works, it is part of the greater works. Prayer is not a side activity.

- God uses prayer to work regeneration in us. 
- Prayer is the battle; wherever, in whatever, it is our responsibility/duty to pray.
- Jesus laid an example; He prayed in agony of spirit, he sweat drops of blood. (Luke 22:44)

### Our Opportunity

Opportunity is found right where you are. 

When are obedient and willing to the Will of God, we become tools in the master's hands.

At the potter's house, each process is different, to prepare the vessel for it's specific purpose &mdash; e.g., clay, china, glass, crystal. The more time you spend now, the more valuable, beautiful it will be latter.

## CONCLUSION:

The commands of this chapter apply to us today as well as to Paul's day. The Christian should behave in every situation in accordance with who God is and what God does. The Christians perspective is oriented to God's view of the world and God's purpose in the world.
