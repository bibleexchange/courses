# Differences of Opinion Among Christians &mdash; Romans 14

## Introduction

Romans chapter fourteen talks about how you should treat a weak brother. We need to help those that are weak in their flesh. We see the need to be charitable. We need to live for God, all that we do needs to be unto God. We should not judge one another, for one day every man will give an account of his own life.

Paul instructs how to receive a weak brother. There is a need for grace in our hearts to the weak, and often we must make a space of mercy for the ignorant. Let us consider a weak brother from Romans chapter fourteen.

There are Differences in the Health of Our Faith & Differences of Opinion (Weak and Strong).

### There is Clear Instruction Given in Scripture

- "Thou Shalt Not" in the 10 Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17)
- Salvation is through Jesus (John 8:24; 14:6; Acts 4:12)
- You Cannot Serve Both God and Riches (Proverbs 28:22; Ephesians 4:19; 1 Timothy 6:10; Matthew 6:24)

### But There is also a Lot of Opinion (of interpretation and application) that fill in-between the Lines, that Christians Divide Over

- Politics (Can you be a Christian and be a Democrat?)
- Woman in Ministry (Can a woman be a pastor?)
- The Internet (Can a Christian remain holy whil using an unholy thing?)
- The Blood of Jesus
- The Authority of the Word of God
- The Baptism of the Holy Ghost
- Saturday/Sunday Debate

### Receive Him that is Weak in the Faith but not for the Sake of Argument.

Most often our opionions are inspired by Scripture but we tend to fill the gray/unexplained areas of Scripture with our opinions. The differences of opinion should not be cause for Division nor an escuse for quarrelling.

Should everybody be just like me?

## What is a Weak Brother in this Context? vs. 2-4

> Romans 14:2-4&mdash; For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. 3 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 4 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. 

The weakness Paul mentions here carries the very ideas of disease and impotence. Those weak in faith are likened to a lame man needing a crutch, a blind needing a guide, or a paralyzed man needing help with every necessity of daily life. Disease ultimately will snuff out life if it is not cured. This weakness of faith is as a sickness that must be understood and handled with grace, but also must be administered healing. Weakness must not be left alone, but must be strengthened.

> James 5:16&mdash;Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

### a. Weakness in Eating &mdash; 

For meat destroy not the work of God! 

v. 20 In I Corinthians 8 Paul had to deal with the same issue with the Corinthian church. This may sound trivial and non-religious of a dispute to the modern Christian, but The Layman&apos;s Bible Commentary gives insight into this controversy.

It was a different kind of religious question in the Roman Empire. The fact is in a Roman market you could hardly find a steak or a roast or any kind of meat that had not come from some animal slaughtered in a heathen temple. The animal would be killed as a sacrifice; then the priests (who, numerous though they were, could not possibly eat all the animals the people offered) would sell the meat through retail outlets. This being the major source of meats on the market, the Christian shopper was faced with a problem: in buying and eating this meat, am I or am I not helping out the heathen worship?

### b. Servants &mdash; Who are you to judge another man&apos;s servant?

### c. Judgment &mdash; Every man must give account to God and not to another.

### d. Days &mdash; 

The spirit of the law questions not did you remember the day, but whether or not you did or did not as unto the Lord?

They worshipped days. They fasted and feasted on certain days. And they were putting more importance on days and not the Christ.

## We are Brethren and not Judges, vs. 5-12

> Romans 14:5-12&mdash; One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. 6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. 7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. 8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. 9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. 10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. 11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. 12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. 

Verse 6, clearly states that both sides know the Lord.

What we are supposed to be doing for others:

- Show Honor and Preference: Romans 12:10; 15:7
- Admonish One Another: Romans 15:14; Colossians 3:16

We are to love the heart of men, and reach out to the heart of men.
We put our heart into other people by loving them.
We show compassion by encouraging other people.
Love corrects, encourages, and teaches.

In order for us to teach someone the difference between right and wrong, we first need to know the difference ourselves.

- Forgive one another: Col 3:13
- Stop Judging: Romans 14:13; 

- I Corinthians 13:4-7
Romans 13:8
Col 3:14
John 13:34
Pro. 10:12
I John 4:8,16
John 13:35
I john 4:7
I john 2:9-11
II Peter 1:7
Heb. 13:1

Romans 12:10 13:8
Heb 3:13
Ephesians 5:21
John 13:14
Philphians 2;3
I Peter 4:9-10, 5:5

- We are to carry each others burdens: Galatians 6:2

No man can help another, without first helping himself understand that principle, that we are to love one another.


Contrasted here is weakness and faith. Weakness looks at the letter of the law, but faith can also see the spirit of the law.



Conduct indicates character.

If your 

First ineffective faith, than weak faith

Weak faith: lacks endurance, often falters

Weak faith can become strong faith, by recognizing our limitations.
Give my limitations to God, and our love shall increase.


Effective faith: depends upon God, more concerned about growth than of size
rests upon what Christ has already done and accomplished
becomes stronger through trials and pressure, by endurance

Our faith needs to be alive and growing.
I have hopeful expectations because of my faith in Christ.
I have put my trust in God. My strength is not in who I am, but in whom I have put my trust in.

## Do Not Put a Stumbling Block in My Brother's Way, vs. 13-17

> 13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. 14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 15 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. 16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 

- Let us not be a reason for someone else&apos;s failure. Let us be encouragers of their faith.
- There is more to the Gospel than my opinions!
- What is the NATURE OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD?
- What Goals ought we to have?

## We are Commission to Pursue After Peace in our Differences, vs. 18-20

> 18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. 19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. 20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. 21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. 

## The Blessing of Liberty, vs. 22-23

> 22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. 

it is Much more blessed to have liberty before God which we do not use on account of our brother's weaknesses, than to insist on liberty, though it is distinctly given.
