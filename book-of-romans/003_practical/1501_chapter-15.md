# Laboring for Unity &mdash; Ch. 15

## Introduction

Believers are to receive one another, as Christ received the Gentiles - to God's glory. The first section of this chapter describes Christian relationships, with Christ as the perfect example of them. Paul's personal message to the Romans begins in Verse 14.

The Work of Unity in the Body is the work of God.

## Receive Another with Christ as Our Example, vs. 1-13

Put Verse 1 & 2 into your own words. Compare with Chapter 14, Verse 19.

Romans chapter fifteen talks about living an unselfish life. Those that are strong are to help the weak. We are to not live to please ourselves but to please God, to put others before us. This chapter ends with Paul&apos;s missionary journeys.


The fifteenth chapter of Romans has a strong feeling of conclusion. As is Paul&apos;s style in this book, he repeats concepts already presented but more directly and personally. He prescribes the following instructions to his readers:

- The Strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak.

- Please our neighbor to their good and edification.

- Bearing toward another the mind of Christ. That ye may with ONE mind and ONE mouth glorify God.

- Jesus is a minister to the Jew and Gentile.

- The Gentiles have reason to rejoice and are commanded to do so in the Scripture.

- Joy and Peace through the Holy Ghost are prerequisites to abounding in hope.

- Being full of goodness, admonish one another.

Why should the Christian be concerned with others instead of himself?

Verse 3:		We should use Christ as our example "For even Christ pleased not himself, His concern
		was for others demonstrated by his love, His teaching, and His healing."


How can the Scripture be a source of encouragement for leading the Christian life?

Verse 4:		Note these 4 words - learning, patience, comfort, and hope.

		We can be comforted in time of need by reading the Scriptures.
		We can also look forward in Hope.


What is the purpose or goal toward which Christians move?

Verses 5 - 6:	We should be united in one mind and spirit glorifying God who is our goal in life.


How are we to welcome and receive fellow Christians?

Verse 7:		"Receive ye one another as Christ also received us."


What was the purpose of Christ's work?

Verse 8:		To comfirm the promises made unto the Fathers


What people were affected?

Verses 8 - 9:	Jews and Gentiles


How do the Old Testament quotations in Verses 9 - 12 substantiate the purpose for Christ's work?

Christ was fulfillment of prophecy.

As you read Verses 1 - 13 can you see the trinity?





## Paul's Priestly Ministry to the Gentiles, vs. 14-21


Paul's great "Priestly Ministry" of the Gospel to the Gentiles Verses 14 - 21.


What assurance has Paul about the Christians at Rome?

Verse 14:	Full of goodness.
		Filled with all knowledge.
		Able to admonish one another.

		Although Paul had never been in Rome, he kept track of believers throughout the
		whole Roman world. Rom. 1:8 (their faith was proclaimed throughout the whole world).


What does Paul refer to himself as?

Verses 15 - 19:	A minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles. Preaching the Word in the power of the Spirit.
		With signs and wonders as the result.


What plans does Paul now have concerning Rome?

- Paul explains that he is called to minister the Gospel especially to the Gentiles.


v. 23-23 Paul restates again his desire and intention to visit the church at Rome and his itinerary. He must first go to Spain and collect an offering for the saints at Jerusalem. He would then bring the offering to Jerusalem, after which he intends to visit Roman.

It is interesting to note that there is somewhat a controversy over Romans 15:14&mdash;16:27. The question is as follows, &quot;Where did Romans originally end.&quot; Many old manuscripts do not contain this passage, and at the same time most do in one way or another. Some have it placed at the end of chapter fourteen and others both at the end of chapter fourteen and at the end of the book. This bears no influence of compromising the texts integrity, but can be logically in a hypothetical manner explained. Someone copying the letter and desiring to disperse it amongst many different churches could have left off the parts personal to the church at Rome.

Verses 20 -23:	Hindered - Paul did not wish to build on another man's foundation (work).
		Here laborers have hindered.

		These many times - show how continually Roman Christians were on his
		mind and his desire.

		A longing to come - He had a tremendous desire to visit these people.


How are the Christians in Macedonia and Achaia concerned for the poor among the Christians at Jerusalem?

Verse 26:	They were to contribute to the poor. Paul himself together with other brethren took
		this offering back to Jerusalem, to seal in person unto this fruit of the blessed gospel!


What spiritual principal is Paul teaching the Romans by relating this news?

It was an act of love on the part of the Gentile Saints. It was a fulfilling of our Lord's words:

"If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them." By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another.

In Verse 30 we once again see the trinity.

	- For the Lord Jesus Christ's sake.
	- For the Love of the Spirit.
	- Your prayers to God for me.


## Conclusion

The beautiful benediction of Verse 33, "The God of peace be with you all," shows how fully at peace was the apostle's heart, and how fully in God's will! Also his overflowing love for the Saints.

The motive and power behind Christian unity is Christ's example of love and service and sacrifice. To have such harmony among Christians, we need to pray as Paul did for the Lord's enabling. Paul's sense of commission did not make him independent of his fellow Christians.
