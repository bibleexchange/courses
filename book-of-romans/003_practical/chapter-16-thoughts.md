Romans 16: 

Priscilla and Aquilla

> Acts 18:1-3&mdash; After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; 2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. [0]
3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

Agrippa I. He may have lived in Rome as a private person and was a friend of the Emperor
Claudius. He may have died in 45 or 48 A.D. A more remote possibility is that he is the son of
