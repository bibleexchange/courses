# Chapter 12: A Living Sacrifice

## Introduction

### Overview

Romans chapters 12-16 complete the final section of this book. This section is particularly practical in its instruction. We see the righteousness of God applied to the daily life of the Believer.

Romans chapter twelve deals with the Christian&apos;s duties, which ultimately leads to a surrendered life.  The church is compared to the human body.  There should be unity among the body, if there is no unity, the body will not function properly.  This chapter also deals with the different duties of the church.  This chapter ends with the Christian spirit.  We are not to overcome but not with evil but we are to overcome with good. 

### Word Studies

Often times words lose their value with us with overuse. Let us look more closely at the vocabulary of the first two verses of this chapter that we may gain a deeper understanding of it:

**Beseech** &mdash; This has the ideas of to call near and intreat. This is a plea in earnest.

**Therefore** &mdash; What is it THERE FOR? All of Chapter eleven expresses what grace has brought about. The outcast has been included. Therefore, we must do&hellip;.

**Brethren** &mdash; He speaks to those that have been blood bought and born again. Not, the Israel of Isaac, but of the spiritual Israel. 

**Mercies of God** &mdash; It is by the mercy of God that we would be hearing such a plea. Had it not been for God&apos;s mercy shown on the road to Damascus, Paul could not make such a plea. He does not make the plea because he is better than everyone, but because of God&apos;s mercy is he qualified to make such a plea.

**Bodies** &mdash; In the mortal body we must glorify God. Not just someday and for now do the best that we can. &hellip;We should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.&mdash;Titus 2:12

**Living Sacrifice** &mdash; The flesh must be crucified. Our will must be crucified. We offer alive, but God thoroughly will purge us as long as we remain on the altar.

**Holy** &mdash; Our lives ought to be light to those that wander in the darkness.

**Acceptable unto God** &mdash; fully agreeable; well pleasing In this age full of men pleasers, we must seek our approval from God. What does He think about a direction you take? To be accepted by this world is to be rejected by Him. We cannot be agreeable with the flesh and this world and at the same time be agreeable to God. There must be a clear line of alliance defined. Who will you side with?

**Reasonable service** &mdash; His yoke is easy, but any requirement God could make of us would pale in greatness to what He has provided for us.

**Conformed** &mdash; Conform to the same pattern; fashion self according to; 

**Transformed** &mdash; metamorphosis; change; This is the miraculous work of God.

**Renewing of your Mind** &mdash; Our mind is made new by the Word. Replace our carnal thoughts with What saith the Lord.

**Good, Acceptable, & Perfect Will of God** &mdash; This is not God&apos;s three wills, but three adjectives of God&apos;s one sovereign will. He is not double-minded (or triple-minded for that matter).

### God's Perfect Will

Paul's Great Plea for Personal Consecration to God, in view of His mercies. Paul teaches desiring the perfect will of God for each believer.

Instructions are given for the Believer to follow. This chapter is so rich, a lifetime could be devoted to its study. Let us complete our introduction to Romans 12 with a simple list of the different thoughts presented in Romans 12. They are categorized respectively: 1) God&apos;s gifts to man, and 2) man&apos;s return responsibility to God for what God has given.

## Verse 1

> 1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

#### The Sacrifice

"present your bodies" - not the soul only but the body as well. "With the spirit worship God but wiht the body sin. -- ought not be. 

Mind, hands, feet, eyes, ears, hands, the intellect, ambitions

#### The Nature of the Sacrifice

1. Sacrifice 

a free will offering, it will cost you something, 

David bought Araunah's threshing floor 1 Chronicles 21:24.

2. Living

We must present ourselves ALIVE to God!

3. Holy

4 Acceptable

"unto God"

#### The Reasonableness of the Sacrifice

### What are the "mercies of God" to which Paul refers?

1. Justification - including pardon, removal from sins, trespasses never to be remembered, a right standing in Christ - being made the righteousness of God in Him.

2. Identification - taken out of Adam by death with Christ - dead to sin and the law - we now become identified with Christ.

3.  Under Grace - Fruit unto God - unto sanctification, made possible.

4. The Spirit Indwelling - the spirit witnesses of Sonship and Heirship.

5. Help in Infirmity - and in any present sufferings, on our way to share Christ's glory.

6. Divine Election - our final conformity to the image of Christ - God's settled purpose.

7. Coming Glory - beyond any comparison with sufferings.

8. No Separation Possible - God loves us in Christ.

9. Confidence in God's Faithfulness - confirmed by His revealed plans for Israel.

### Reasonable Service


**GOD HAS GIVEN SO MUCH TO HIS PEOPLE**: Grace Given, Dealt to every man the measure of faith, made One Body in Christ, Gifts, Prophecy, rewards according to faith, Ministry, Teaching, Exhorting, etc.

**GOD&apos;s PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO ACT ACCORDINGLY**: Think Soberly, Giving with Simplicity, Ruling with Diligence, Show mercy with Cheerfulness, Let Love be without Dissimulation, Abhor that which is evil, Cleave to that which is good, Kindly Affectioned, Brotherly Love, In Honor Preferring one Another, not Slothful in Business, Fervent in Spirit, Serving the Lord, Rejoicing in hope, Patient in Tribulation, Continuing Instant in Prayer, Distributing to the necessity of Saints, Given to Hospitality, Bless them which Persecute You, bless and Curse Not, Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep, Be of the same mind one toward another, etc.

> Romans 12:1 [Amplified Bible] &mdash; I appeal to you therefore, brethren, and beg of you in view of [all] the mercies of God, to make a decisive dedication of your bodies [presenting all your members and faculties] as a living sacrifice, holy (devoted, consecrated) and well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable (rational, intelligent) service and spiritual worship.

- A Right Attitude is Essential Acts 1:14
- Ask - for it is a gift Acts 10:45
- Fast and Pray Acts 9:9-17
- Obedience Acts 5:32

## Verse 2

> 2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

### What becomes the motivating center of a Christians life? 

THE WILL OF GOD.

Renewing of your mind.  The whole "mind" must become the object of the Spirit's renewing power.  The entire mind must come under the spirits control.

### Real Salvation = Practical holiness

Wearing His righteousness and thus daily purifying ourselves 

Successful Christians:

1. They have a sound foundation (which is the Word of God)
2. They have a sound work habits
3. They esteem others before themselves
4. They keep their self-respect by being loyal to God and His holy word
5. They do things God&apos;s way, understanding that it always the best way
6. They are very cooperative (finding what God wants in any situation and doing it)
7. They listen to others (and in return they are heard)
8. They are enthusiastic about every endeavor that they are faced with
9. They are a friend (and in return they have friends)
10. They are sincere
11. They set goals (both small and large goals)
12. They use any failure as a stepping stone for success
13. They set their mind (on things above, not on the things of this earth)
14. They find a place to rest their mind (in fasting and praying)
15. They have skill &mdash; they are instant in season and out of season
16. They give God the glory for they have accomplished
17. They check their motives
18. And then they &mdash; Start Again!!!

### Renewing of Your Mind

The renewing of our mind happens through the Word of God. 2 Timothy 2:15; Psalm 119:105

### Being not conformed to the world:

>   10 But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. 11 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.12 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. 13 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

> John 1:9&mdash;That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

>  Hebrews 9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

The world uses the principles of God to become successful for their own gain. If we use the principles of God to become successful not for us but for Him and His kingdom; how much more of value is that. 

Winning souls for the kingdom, what a joy and privilege (Proverbs 11:30) 

Receive our ideas through prayer &mdash; what does that have to do with Romans? 

Why do I want to be a successful Christian? Success is learning how to lead others to Christ. We are to pattern our lives after Christ. 


## Verses 3-8

>  3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: 5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. 6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; 7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; 8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

What attitudes should the Christian have toward himself and toward his fellow Christians?

- We are one body in Christ, with varying gifts.
- Everyone members one of another.

What is the one possessing a gift supposed to do with it? The various gifts are bestowed by the Spirit. The working of the gifts are for prophecy, ministering, teaching, exhorting, etc.

FAITH - For the receiving and using of these gifts, there is the necessity of faith for operation.

The possession of a gift is of no use unless it is put to use.  It is the whole-hearted exercise of the gifts, when it is given, that is urged by the apostles. Gifts are a directly given of the Spirit.


## Verse 9

>  9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.

## Verse 10


>  10 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;

## Verse 11


>  11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

## Verse 12


>  12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;

## Verse 13


>  13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

## Verse 14


>  14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

## Verse 15


>  15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

## Verse 16


>  16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

## Verse 17


>  17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.

## Verse 18


>  18 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.

## Verse 19


>  19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

## Verses 20-21


>  20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. 21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. 

Romans 12:20 is an aggressive stance. It is not a defensive stance. 
To overcome is to defeat the enemy. Those that speak evil, and do evil; we are in a warfare for that persons soul. 
Our act of aggression as Christians is an act of prayer. 
Do we pray until we weep within our souls for other people? The battle is within our souls. The Love that we show to others is not show the Lords hate but his love. Now our weapons are not the same weapons as those used in traditional warfare, but they are more powerful. 
If you were to die tomorrow, what would you do? And the answer to that question is an indicator of weather we are spiritual or carnal. 
Defeat brings disgrace to Christ. Am I recognizing his authority in my life? 
We are called to a different kind of warfare. A warfare of peace, love, joy&hellip; 
II Corinthians 10:4
The Stronghold is the mind, 
Christ is our example, while being crucified and etc&hellip; he forgave 
II Corinthians 2:14
Romans 8:29 If I do not yield to his plan, it will not become successful
By doing the word of God, we can have an affect on everyone that we come into contact with. 
Romans 2:4 &mdash; People react better to good better than bad&hellip;
What not said, is sometimes more important than what people do say. 

## Conclusion to Romans 12

Being a Christian involves every area of a persons life.  Mind and body are yielded to God in moral surrender as a spiritual offering.  By his attitude and actions toward other Christians he is to demonstrate the fact that he is a fellow-member with them in the body of Christ.  In his relationship with the sinner, he is to act in love and leave to God the avenging of evil.
