# Helpers of the Weak, Not Judges &mdash; Ch. 14

Romans chapter fourteen talks about how you should treat a weak brother. We need to help those that are weak in their flesh. We see the need to be charitable. We need to live for God, all that we do needs to be unto God. We should not judge one another, for one day every man will give an account of his own life.


Paul instructs how to receive a weak brother. There is a need for grace in our hearts to the weak, and often we must make a space of mercy for the ignorant. Let us consider a weak brother from Romans chapter fourteen.

## Weak Brother in Codex.

It carries the very ideas of disease and impotence. Those weak in faith are likened to a lame man needing a crutch, a blind needing a guide, or a paralyzed man needing help with every necessity of daily life. Disease ultimately will snuff out life if it is not cured. This weakness of faith is as a sickness that must be understood and handled with grace, but also must be administered healing. Weakness must not be left alone, but must be strengthened.

a. Eating &mdash; for meat destroy not the work of God! v. 20 In I Corinthians 8 Paul had to deal with the same issue with the Corinthian church. This may sound trivial and non-religious of a dispute to the modern Christian, but The Layman&apos;s Bible Commentary gives insight into this controversy.

It was a different kind of religious question in the Roman Empire. The fact is in a Roman market you could hardly find a steak or a roast or any kind of meat that had not come from some animal slaughtered in a heathen temple. The animal would be killed as a sacrifice; then the priests (who, numerous though they were, could not possibly eat all the animals the people offered) would sell the meat through retail outlets. This being the major source of meats on the market, the Christian shopper was faced with a problem: in buying and eating this meat, am I or am I not helping out the heathen worship?

b. Servants &mdash; Who are you to judge another man&apos;s servant?
c. Judgment &mdash; Every man must give account to God and not to another.
d. Days &mdash; The spirit of the law questions not did you remember the day, but whether or not you did or did not as unto the Lord?
e. Brothers &mdash; Let us not be a reason for someone else&apos;s failure. Let us be encouragers of their faith.

Finally contrasted here is weakness and faith. Weakness looks at the letter of the law, but faith can also see the spirit of the law.

How can I love you?
Romans chapter 14:

Conduct indicates character.
Romans 14: Is designed to designate the difficult&hellip;
Roman rule, there were a lot of Gods in Rome at this time. And when they sacrificed to a God, they only used part of the animal and the rest of it was sold on the open market.
They worshipped days. They fasted and feasted on certain days. And they were putting more importance on days and not the Christ.
We are to love the heart of men, and reach out to the heart of men.
We put our heart into other people by loving them.
We show compassion by encouraging other people.
Love corrects, encourages, and teaches.
In order for us to teach someone the difference between right and wrong, we first need to know the difference.
Romans 8:3, 4
God loves me regardless of how much I hate him.
Now they thought they were not defiling themselves, by not eating the meat that might have been sacrificed to idols.
Christ&apos;s love is perfect, and is perfectly given.
But we really don&apos;st know how to love; we need his nature to truly love like we should.
It is in love that we are going to draw them to you, to Christ.
Romans 14:14
They have all theses principles that they are trying to follow. But they did not understand that Jesus did away with the ceremonial laws.
If I have knowledge I can change things. But I need him to do the changing.
Because it is in understanding that we get the victory.
How can I avoid the problem in the future? How can I comfort myself in the pain that I am feeling right now?
Love corrects: 1-corrects, than 2-encourages, than 3-embraces than 4-teaches.

First ineffective faith, than weak faith

Weak faith
lacks endurance
often falters

Weak faith can become strong faith, by recognizing our limitations.
Give my limitations to God, and our love shall increase.


Effective faith
depends upon God
more concerned about growth than of size
rests upon what Christ has already done and accomplished
becomes stronger through trials and pressure, by endurance

Our faith needs to be alive and growing.
I have hopeful expectations because of my faith in Christ.
I have put my trust in God. My strength is not in who I am, but in whom I have put my trust in.

The beginning point of faith believes in who Christ is.
His conduct towards us shows us how much we love him
