# Conclusion to the Study of Romans
Romans chapter sixteen deals with Paul sending greetings to the Roman church.  Priscilia and Aquilia, who were Paul&apos;s helpers, are mentioned in this chapter.  Paul gives warnings in this chapter.  Satan is defeated and The Mystery of Christ is revealed, through the Word
## Paul&apos;s Salutations &mdash; Ch. 16:1-16
In this final chapter is shown to us the personal side of Paul. He speaks as one does to friends and not only a leader or pastor. This sixteenth chapter is often neglected by many.  It is by far the most extensive, intimate, and particular of all the words of loving greeting in Paul's marvelous letters.  No one can afford to miss this wonderful outpouring of the heart of our Apostle toward the Saints whom he so love - which means all the real Church of God.

Each name listed in Pauls closing remarks undoubtedly has a story of courage, love and devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ.  Of the twenty-four to whom Paul sends special greetings, six are women, indicating the position and importance of women among the Christian group at Rome.

Paul recommends a sister:
Phebe, our sister, which is a servant of the church at Cenchrea

<<Written to the Romans from Corinthus, [and sent by Phebe servant of the church at Cenchrea.]>>

Paul Salutes those at Rome:
- Priscilla and Aquila, my helpers in Christ
- The House Church of Priscilla and Aquila
- Epaenetus, my well-beloved, the first fruits unto Christ of Achaia
- Mary, who bestowed much labor on us
- Adronicus and Junia my kinsmen, and my fellow prisoners, of the apostles, were in Christ before Paul
- Amplias, my beloved in the Lord
- Urbane, our helper in Christ
- Stachys, my beloved
- Apelles approved in Christ
- Those in Aristobulus&apos;s household
- Herodian, my kinsman
- Those of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord
- Tryphena and Tryphosa, labor in the Lord
- Ro 16:12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord.
- Persis, beloved, which laboured much in the Lord.
- Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
- Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.
- Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.

Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you. v.16

The concluding of the last chapter of Romans
Do you know who Phebe was; she was a sister not in the flesh but in the Lord.
Priscilla and Aquila come right to mind in this chapter.
Why did the gentile church feel thankful for Priscilla and Aquila? Because they risked their own necks for them.
Whom did Paul refer to as a fellow prisoner?
3-16 ‚Üê Salutations to saints and the assembly in Rome
17-20
Earlier he was referring to fellow prisoners
20-24 ~ now he is referring to fellow workers
25-27
Why do you think she was trusted by this Christian woman? Because of her trustworthiness, and probably she had longed wanted to go to the city on her on (but that is a speculation).
The older men and woman are to leave an example for the younger men and woman.

The theme is sin, salvation, Christian growth, God&apos;s sovereignty, and God&apos;s service.
Sin means refusing God&apos;s will and failing to do all that God wants.
All have sinned against God either by sinning or refusing God&apos;s will.
We cannot earn salvation, you must repent.
Our sin points out our need, God in his kindness reached out in love to save me, Christ paid the debt.
We must believe that Jesus died for us.
He enables me to become more like him,
Because we are free from sin&apos;s control, we can grow in our relationship with Christ.
Sovereignty: God oversees all, all his ways are fair,
Because of God&apos;s mercy all Jews and gentiles can be saved.
He is sovereign so let him reign.
Service: our purpose is to God the credit in his love power and perfection and all we do and credit.
Serving him unifies in all we do, and enables us to love and help them.

We are going to go over the love that Paul showed to different others.
Ministering in the will of God&hellip; The will of God, we are supposed to work in his behalf, not him to work for us.
