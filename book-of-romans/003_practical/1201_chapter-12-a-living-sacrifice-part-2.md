# Chapter 12: A Living Sacrifice, Part 2

## Verses 3-8

> 3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: 5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. 6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; 7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; 8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

What attitudes should the Christian have toward himself and toward his fellow Christians?

- We are one body in Christ, with varying gifts.
- Everyone members one of another.

What is the one possessing a gift supposed to do with it? The various gifts are bestowed by the Spirit. The working of the gifts are for prophecy, ministering, teaching, exhorting, etc.

FAITH - For the receiving and using of these gifts, there is the necessity of faith for operation.

The possession of a gift is of no use unless it is put to use. It is the whole-hearted exercise of the gifts, when it is given, that is urged by the apostles. Gifts are a directly given of the Spirit.

>ILLUSTRATION: When President William McKinley had to make a decision about the appointment of an ambassador to a foreign country. Two candidates were equally qualified. When McKinley was still a Congressman, he had observed an inconsiderate action by one of the men. He recalled boarding a streetcar at the rush hour and getting the last vacant seat. Soon an elderly woman got on, carrying a heavy clothes basket. No one got up to offer her a seat, so she walked the length of the car and stood in the aisle, hardly able to keep her balance as the vehicle swayed from side to side. One of the men McKinley was later to consider for ambassador was sitting next to where the woman was standing. Instead of getting up and helping her, he deliberately shifted his newspaper so it would look like he hadnâ€™t seen her. When McKinley noticed this, he walked down the aisle, graciously took her basket, and offered her his seat. The man was unaware that anyone was watching, but that one little act of selfishness would later deprive him of perhaps the crowning honor of his lifetime.

### Love Good and Abhor Evil

ahbor: hate, detest utterly 

> Psalm 34:14&mdash;Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

"evil" - that which is hurtful, degenerate in nature, of the devil, malicious, bad

GOOD INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SAINTS: Run away from evil and run toward good. This is not a fearfulness of evil as in superstition, but is a sanctification or separation of our conduct and thought life from those things that are contrary to the Holiness of God.

How can we "abhor" and "depart" from evil? (Psalm 37:27; Isaiah 1:16)

> 20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. 21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

 v. 21 - Ephesians 6:11 1 John 3:8 1 Corinthians 15:57 Philippians 4:13 1 John 5:4 Revelation 12:11 1 Peter 5:8 

Romans 12:20 is an aggressive stance. It is not a defensive stance. 
To overcome is to defeat the enemy. Those that speak evil, and do evil; we are in a warfare for that persons soul. 
Our act of aggression as Christians is an act of prayer. 
Do we pray until we weep within our souls for other people? The battle is within our souls. The Love that we show to others is not show the Lords hate but his love. Now our weapons are not the same weapons as those used in traditional warfare, but they are more powerful. 
If you were to die tomorrow, what would you do? And the answer to that question is an indicator of weather we are spiritual or carnal. 
Defeat brings disgrace to Christ. Am I recognizing his authority in my life? 

We are called to a different kind of warfare. A warfare of peace, love, joy&hellip; 

II Corinthians 10:4

The Stronghold is the mind, 

Christ is our example, while being crucified and etc&hellip; he forgave 
II Corinthians 2:14
Romans 8:29 If I do not yield to his plan, it will not become successful
By doing the word of God, we can have an affect on everyone that we come into contact with. 
Romans 2:4 &mdash; People react better to good better than bad&hellip;
What not said, is sometimes more important than what people do say. 

## Conclusion to Romans 12

Being a Christian involves every area of a persons life. Mind and body are yielded to God in moral surrender as a spiritual offering. By his attitude and actions toward other Christians he is to demonstrate the fact that he is a fellow-member with them in the body of Christ. In his relationship with the sinner, he is to act in love and leave to God the avenging of evil.
