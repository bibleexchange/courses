# Grace Reigns in Servants of Righteousness 	Ch. 6

In Chapter six, Paul clearly establishes that the saint should not continue in sin. Paul answers the question “Shall we sin?” by asking and answering two similar but different questions.
Verses 1-14	Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?	
Verses 15-23	Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?

Paul proves by inspiration of God that there is no good reason to sin! There is no scenario where sinning is appropriate or beneficial. 

## Grace Abounds in our Walking in the Newness of Christ’s Life Vs. 1-14

QUESTION:  vs. 1 Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?  
ANSWER: vs. 2 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?  

Paul preaches that to live in sin if we are dead sin is a paradox—an impossibility. You are either dead to sin or you are alive to sin! When the rescue team checks for vitals, the victim’s heart is either pumping blood or his heart has stopped. If we are crucified in Christ, God does not raise again that old carnal man! God raises us up in NEWNESS of Life.

### How Can WE Being Dead...?	v. 1-6
We who are: Baptized into Christ’s death, Crucified with Christ, Dead to Sin

Paul presents to us the picture of death and draws the parallel between Christ’s death and resurrection and the spiritual death and resurrection of the Believer. Let us consider death itself. 

#### Dead men do not react.
People grab a hold of concepts such as the Believer’s death to sin and run with it. They say, “I am dead,” but when the heat is turned on and the pressure increases beyond reason heard are the cries of self and the flesh. If we are dead then we shouldn’t feel anything in regards to the temptation of sin, and shouldn’t react hotly to pressure situations. Dead men don’t react and don’t have any feeling.

#### Dead men do not feed their flesh.

A dead man has no need for pizza, hamburger, or even vegetables. These are sources of sustenance, and a dead man has no life to sustain. The living man eats with the purpose of maintaining life. If we are crucifying the flesh, why would we at the same time fight to keep him alive? Starve that old nature to death, and feed the spirit man.

#### Dead men do not have life. 

This third observation may appear oversimplified, but bear with me. A man may live a full life filled with drunkenness and all kinds of selfishness and sin, but when he dies, his spirit leaves his body and that body no longer contains life. There rests the same hands that raised the bottle, the same feet that ran quickly to mischief, but now being dead and the spirit gone it is emptied of all evidence of life good or bad. The Believer’s situation is similar, but not exact. The Believer’s situation is similar in that in being crucified with Christ, he no longer contains that old life (2 Cor. 4:7). All things have become new, as an infant child just born, perfect. The Believer’s situation extends beyond the condition of natural death in that he is dead to sin, but alive to righteousness. This is a dual condition where an individual’s flesh is crucified and his spirit is made alive to walk in newness of life. If we are dead to sin and alive to Christ then our life now has no properties similar to our old life. A magnet cannot attract aluminum because their properties are such there is no possible way for the two to interact.

### LIVE any longer in sin?		Vs. 5,7-14
#### Having DIED, we are FREE from sin.
#### Having died WITH CHRIST, we shall LIVE with Him! RESURRECTION

#### Death Has No More Dominion Over Christ 		vs. 9,10
(Dead to Sin, but alive to God) 

#### The Believer Must Exercise Self-Control		 vs. 11-14

“LET not sin…”There is a power in God (His Grace) that enables man to become dead to sin and live right. The Believer must exercise his faith diligently in God’s provision that the Believer is no longer under the dominion of sin. 
“Self-control” is required of saints. A diligent work is required of Believers in order to remain under grace and out from under the curse of the law. Notice the words of action demanded of the saints in these verses: reckon ye also yourselves… Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body…Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God….
We overcome sin by the word of God...Doing what he says. Yielding yourselves to God means that you find the root cause of your sin and remove it from your life. Is the root cause anger....then repent and turn to God.  Let Him help you with it, by doing what the word instructs us to do.

#### CONCLUSION:14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.  

## Being Under Grace (& Not Under the Law) is not a License to Sin	
Vs. 15-23

### The Story of Grace

15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.  

The saint is relieved of a master when he is crucified to sin with Christ, but truly the saint changes master. Lordship of the  Believer’s life, belongs to Christ. We are free from sin, but this also means we are bound to righteousness.
Sin is the slave trap of Satan; righteousness is the service of Christ. If ye sin ye are the servants of Satan, and not the servants of God.You cannot serve sin and be a servant to God
Grace reigns through righteousness. (Romans 5:21) God’s grace doesn’t help us serve sin, but enables us to serve God. God’s servants are to be sanctified—separated from sin and separated unto God.

The Truth concerning God’s Grace:
- Grace is not just a covering.
- Grace is the power to give you life.
- Grace imparts the divine nature through faith

### To Whom You Yield to – sin or God –his servant you are. Vs. 16

### You were servants to sin, but now are servants of righteousness vs.  17 -19 

“Old habits die hard,” or so the saying goes. Having changed our object of servitude from sin and self to God, we must be vigilant in our effort to serve our Master faithfully. We are instructed to do some things.
- Reckon yourself dead to sin, but alive to God. 
- Let not sin reign in your mortal body.
- Yield not your members to sin—not even the smallest member. Do not volunteer the slightest aid to promoting the devil’s cause.
- Yield yourselves unto God—sanctify yourself wholly to God.
- Remember the shame of Sin! 

What fruit had ye? What is the value of your service? It is the wage you earn. The Christian ought to be ashamed of his old life and service to sin, for sin makes a mockery of every man. 

### Contrasting the results of Sin and the results of Righteousness Vs. 20-23
