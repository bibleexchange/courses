## Patiently Wait for the Adoption, vs. 17-25

>  17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. 20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. 24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? 25 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

### Christian Maturity

#### The Enemy of Maturity

The doctrine of "sameness" is not only prevelant in secular arenas but is pervasive in Christian thought. After full inspection, this doctrine is oppositional to the doctrine of perfection.

> 1 John 3:1-3&mdash;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

<!-- -->

> Galatians 4:1-5&mdash;Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. 3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: 4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

<!-- -->
> 2 Peter 1:4&mdash;Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

The Christian is to be developing and maturing. We are not all the same in that respect. We all mature differently.

#### The Doctrine of Maturity - Perfection - Completed Righteousness - The Redemption of Our Body - Manifestation of the Sons of God

- God's Work is not Complete in the Believer at Regeneration & Justification

> Romans 8:23 &mdash;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body

We need to grow and Christ is the standard.

> 2 Peter 3:18&mdash;But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen. 
<!-- -->
> 1 Corinthians 13:9-12&mdash;For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. 11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
<!-- -->
> James 1:2-4&mdash;My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
<!-- -->
> 2 Corinthians 3:18&mdash; 18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 
<!-- -->
> Ephesians 4:13&mdash;Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

##### The Evidence of Maturity

> Romans 8:14&mdash;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

- “led” (controlled) by the spirit.
- Divine Guidance is the Scriptural evidence of Maturity and Sonship.
- There is a difference between Divine guidance and natural reasoning, circumstances or impressions.
- Sons of God - "Sons" means adult sons - sons that have come of age

1. Distinct Direction

- The Holy Spirit makes no mistakes. People do, but the Holy Spirit does not.
- The Holy Spirit leads as the Pillar of Cloud and Fire that led Israel.
- The Holy Spirit guides as the guide to a traveller.
- The Holy Spirit leads us as a General leads his army.
- The Holy Spirit guides us as a ship is by the pilot. Where He governs He leads. They must be subject to His will. 
- The Holy Spirit leads the willing.

2. Detailed Direction

- The Holy Spirit gives absolute, clear, detailed instructions.

Philip (Acts 8:29-30); Peter (Acts 10:19-20); The Church ( Acts 13:2-4); Paul (Acts 16:6)

- The Holy Spirit's Leading is into Truth (John 16:13), by the Word (Psalm 119:105) and in Power (Romans 8:14).

> Romans 8:14&mdash;For as many as are led ["ago"]&hellip;

The Greek word "ago" means to bring or carry like the wind. The Holy Spirit leads like the wind in the sails of a ship. The sails have to be set right. Also, like the influence of the son on teh trees. The sun draws life into the trees.

3. Decision for Direction

> Romans 8:14&mdash;For as many as are led ["ago"]&hellip;

- There must be a decision made.
- There must be a definite decision and your decision will not be changeable.
- There must be a knowledgeable decision ( 1 Corinthians 2:9-10; Galatians 5:18)

4. Deliverance Demanded

> Romans 8:14&hellip;they are the sons of God.

"huios" positioned as a son

- Completed Deliverance
- Mature Sons. Their conduct gives evidence of the diginity of their relationship and their likeness of His character.

###### The Explanation of Maturity

> 1 Peter 2:1-2&mdash;Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, 2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:

###### Greek Words in New Testament Translated Child and Related Terms

1. teknon - that which is born (boy or girl)
2. teknion - child (term of endearment)
3. huios - son, male (origin, relationship to the father)
4. pais - son or daughter (in relation to law) boy or girl (in relation to age) a servant or maid (in relation to condition)
5. paidon - young or little child (term of endearment)
6. paidarion - (a lad, little boy or girl)
7. nepios - (not old enough to speak)
8. brephos - an embryo
9. korasion - young girl (term of endearment)
10. neaniskos - young man (20-40 years old)

##### The Development of the Child

- **Unborn** - "gaster" in the belly, "with child", unborn
1. Not Yet prodouced
2. Developing within the Body of the mother

> 1 Thessalonians 5:3&mdash;For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.


- **Child** - "teknon" not fully mature, still in the process of development
1. Not in the place to receive the full inheritance

Until the time apointed by the faither (Galatians 4:1-2) and ready to be revelated in the last time. (1 Peter 1:4,5; Luke 21:28; Ephesians 1:14; Romans 8:22,23)

2. It does not yet appear what we shall be (1 John 3:2)

A. "Now are we the sons (teknon) of God." The KJV uses the word sons to denote "teknon" which is never a mature son, but a younger child. We are now the sons (teknon) of God, who are not yet in the place to receive their full inheritance, but when HE SHALL APPEAR, WE SHALL BE LIKE HIM. Notice the text does not say "after He appears" but "when He appears". Ephesians 5:25-27 A READY & PREPARED PEOPLE.

B. In the last days, God is perfecting a people to bring them into their full inheritance.

- **Son** - "huios" a mature son, a placed son ( connected with the inheritance)

The Manchild is a fully mature son of God, a placed son, who is walking in fulll in heritance rights. 1 Peter 1:4,5; Ephesians 1:14; A Perfect man. Ephesians 4:12-13; Matthew 5:48;

### The Meaning of Adoption

In Romans 8:14-16 and Galatians 4:1-5, we are introduced to a deeper concept which is adoption, the manifestation of the sons of God. We understand that every man is BORN into the family of God (John 3:3), so what is this "adoption" all about? 

#### Adoption in Roman Law

Adoption is the legal action by which a person takes into his family a child not his own with the purpose of treating him as and giving him all the privileges of his own natural child. An adopted child is legally entitled to all rights and privileges of a natural-born child. In adoption a person is permanently placed in the family with the status of a son or attains sonship.

According to the Roman legal system the person who was adopted into a family gained all the legal rights of a legitimate son in the new family, but he lost all the rights, privileges and responsibilities in his old family. He was now an equal with the other sons and daughters in his new family. He was a co-heir with them according to the law. He was regarded as a new person who had a new life in a new family.

Another wonderful thing about the Roman law was that the old life of the adopted son was completely wiped out. All of his debts were cancelled. His past now had nothing to do with him. He was in a new relationship with a new family.

The changes the adopted person went through under Roman law can be summarized as:

1. A Change in **Family** ( Ephesians 3:14,15; 1 Corinthians 15:49)
2. A Change in **Name** (Acts 11:26; Revelation 2:17; Revelation 3:12; John 1:42)
3. A Change of **Home** (John 14:2; Philippians 3:20,21)
4. A Change of **Responsibility** (Acts 13:38,39; Titus 3:1-11)

#### Adoption in Jewish Law &amp; Custom

There was no Jewish "adoption" law, and when a man died without male offspring to continue his line, there were other provisions made. This was different from Roman law which allowed a man to create an heir from outside his family. In Jewish law, only sons by birth were esteemed.

Although there was no official Jewish law of adoption we can see the principles of adoption were not lost to the Jews as in the cases of:

- Abraham and his servant Eliezer (Genesis 15:2-4)
- Moses in Pharoah's House (Exodus 2:10)
- Genubath was brought into Pharoah's Household  among the sons of Pharoah (1 Kings 11:20)
- Esther was raised in her uncle's home (Esther 2:7)

#### Adoption in Relation to the New Testament

The Greek word for adoption (huiothesia) means to "place as a son" and is used only by Paul in the New Testament. Paul uses this word five times in his letters.

> Romans 8:15&mdash;For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
<!-- -->
> Romans 8:23&mdash;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
<!-- -->
> Romans 9:4&mdash;Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;
<!-- -->
> Galatians 4:5&mdash;To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
<!-- -->
> Ephesians 1:5&mdash;Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
<!-- -->

Adoption in Paul's letters is expansive. It includes the principles of "placement in the family of God" as for each Believer is a work completed, but it also speaks of a work not yet done. In Romans 8:23, Adoption is something the Believer who has received the firstfruits of the Spirit does "wait for".

The "Adoption" for which the Believer patiently waits has to do with placing the fully matured and fully developed into Sonship. This thought combined with the manifestation of the sons of God (v.19) speak of God’s ultimate plan in salvation. He is desirous to have many sons like His only Son. We often refer to this plan as End Time Salvation. 

End Time Salvation is God’s plan of salvation in its totality, salvation to the uttermost, of the whole man—body, soul, and spirit—which in time past was not an available provision because of the appropriateness of time. It is now made available to us living in the end times (or, the time of the end).

It is communicated throughout Scripture through many different thoughts. Listed below are some of the thoughts included in End Time Salvation: 
- End Time Deliverance
- Full salvation
- Apolutrosis: Complete State of Release
- Adoption: The Placing of Sons (Sonship)
- One Hundred Fold Christian
- Full Grown
- Manifestation of the Sons of God
- Fully Mature Sons of God
- Perfect Man
- The Bride of Christ
- Overcomer
- Completeness of Personality
- Complete Sanctification
- Man-child

### Closer Look at the Text Itself (verses 17-25)

The Believer has great things to look forward to in God. God has done great things in and for the Believer and there is yet a redemption that we patiently wait for in hope or faith! What does the Believer have to look forward to?

#### Heirs of God (v. 17a)

> 17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; 

Sharing the relationship with the Father as a son, the Believer receives the privileges and inheritance of a son. Verse 14 speaks of "adult sons" who are Led by the Spirit (have proven the life Christ) and verse 17 speaks of ones born whose privileges are because of who Christ is! (Verse 16) And the Spirit bears witness with our Spirit that we are the children of God.



What the Christian can look forward to.
8:17	If children - than heirs.     We have legal inheritance rights.
8:14 speaks of adult sons.
8:17 speaks of born ones - those who are born of the Word and of the Spirit.
Iv. HOPE OF SUFFERING
Sufferings in comparison to glory.  (If we suffer we shall also reign)
8:18	The Glory revealed (in) us.
8:19	"Creature waiteth"		Earnest expectation within.



Hope and faith is part of Christian living.
8:20	For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of Him who subjected it in hope.
(God has a vast plan, reaching on into eternity, and "hope" lies ahead for creation.)
8:21	"The creature shall be delivered."
From bondage of corruption (although we are new creatures in Christ, yet God has left our bodies as a link with the present creation)
8:24 – 25  Hope - something you know will transpire in your soul.
		- Patience - wait for it.     (Good things come hard in life)
8:26 Holy Spirit helpeth our infirmities.       Our divine helper;   Spirit - breath of God
1.  Prayer - (spirit prays) understood by God.                                                                                               2.  According to His will - the spirit knows how to pray.
8:27	Jesus our intercessor.     - Go between -     Mediator                                                                                                 8:28	Providential Care.  "All things work together for good"  to them that are called.
Called does not mean invited.  "the called" are seen to be a company whose mark is neither religious response nor intellectual apprehending, but the electing grace of God.
Called according to His purpose                                           God is infinite; man, a bit of dust
God has a purpose, (a fixed intention)                                                                                        It will come to pass.








#### Suffering unto Glorification (vs. 17b-18)

> &hellip;if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 

Trials prove the true character of the Christian. And although the suffering is not glorious, Paul brings our attention to glory that will follow. The Christian has the Hope of Suffering--if we suffer, we shall also reign.

This result is to the glory of God! His glory revealed IN US.

Christ is our example (1 Peter 2:21) Hebrews 2:10; 5:8-9; 1 Peter 4:1; James 5:10; Joseph; Moses; Job

It is a choice to go the way of suffering Hebrews 11:25. 

The nature of the suffering is that satan desires to destroy you. 1 Peter 2:20

The results of the suffering Hebrews 12:11; 1 Peter 5:10

#### The Creature Waits for the Manifestation of the Sons of God (vs. 19-22)

19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. 20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 

God has a vast plan and Hope lies ahead for Creation. In bondage because sin is in the world, but there will be a deliverance!

#### The Believer Waits for the Adoption, as Well

23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. 24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? 25 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

"to wit" means "that is to say" ==== "The redemption of our body"

The work is not complete yet in the Believer.

- The Believer Patiently Waits for the Rapture and with that a new Body (
- ---- 1 Corinthians 15:49-53-- vs. 51 Not all be die, but ALL WILL BE CHANGED -- to make different
- ---- 2 Corinthians 5:1-5; 
- ---- Phillipans 3:21)
