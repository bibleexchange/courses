## Will Be Glorified Through the Ministry of the Holy Ghost, vs. 26-30

### The Holy Spirit Helpeth Our Infirmities, v. 26

> 26 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
 
The Holy Spirit is our Divine Helper.

Spirit - "pneuma" - a current of air, breath (blast) or a breeze
 
1. Prayer - (the Spirit Prays) is understood by God. We need a total dependance on the Spirit.
2. According to His Will - The Spirit knows how to pray.
 
### Jesus Our Intercessor, v. 27
 
>  27 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.

"go between"

> "SILENT PRAYER" -- A friend of mine took his small son with him to town one day to run some errands. When lunch time arrived, the two of them went to a familiar diner for a sandwich. The father sat down on one of the stools at the counter and lifted the boy up to the seat beside him. They ordered lunch, and when the waiter brought the food, the father said, "Son, we'll just have a silent prayer." Dad got through praying first and waited for the boy to finish his prayer, but he just sat with his head bowed for an unusually long time. When he finally looked up, his father asked him, "What in the world were you praying about all that time?" With the innocence and honesty of a child, he replied, "How do I know? It was a silent prayer."

Hebrews 7:25; 1 John 2:1; 

> 1 Timothy 2:5&mdash;For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

### God's Purpose Wins!

>  28&mdash;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. 
 
God providentially cares for his people - "the called".

These called are not just "invited" but are "appointed, or a saint". Here "the called" are marked by the electing grace of God. "Called according to His purpose".  As God is sovereign, if God has a purpose ("fixed intention"), it will come to pass.

What is God's major purpose in the life of the Christian?

> 29&mdash;For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. 

Predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son.

God is the Creator, Landscaper, Planner, Builder, Cleaner, Finisher, Inhabitor (Lives in the heart of the Believer).

>30&mdash;Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: &hellip;

Called to be like God.

> 30&mdash;&hellip;and whom he called, them he also justified: 

Justified: Freed from Sin, positioned in Christ.

> 30&mdash;&hellip;and whom he justified, them he also glorified.

Eternal Glory. A glory revealed in us -- the Glory of God.

## Have God as Their Advocate, vs. 31-39

> 31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? 32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? 33 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.  34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.  35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  36 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.  37 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.  38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,  39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

A. Walking after the Spirit is Liberty			Ch. 8
Romans chapter eight deals with our position in Christ.  We are free from sin and death. 
The law of sin brought bondage, but the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has worked great liberty!  OUR POSITION IN CHRIST is free from condemnation.
1. 8:10-16	Mortify the Deeds of the Body, Ye shall Live
2. 8:17-25	Hope of Adoption as Joint Heirs
3. 8:26-28	The Spirit Helps our Infirmities
4. 8:29-30 	The Hope of Glorification
5. 8:31-39	None Shall Stand Against Us, It is God that Justifies
The end of the chapter deals with the Christian’s Hope, which is; “If God be for us who can be against us.”  And that we are more than conquerors and that all things work together for good. The sufferings we go through are to teach us our motives.

Is there anything that can separate us from the love of God?
8:38 - 39	"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	
There is a difference between knowing something and being persuaded of it.
Persuaded - There is a difference between knowing a truth and being heart persuaded of it.
Paul in his experience, had been through all these trials and tests.
Persuaded - His mind, his conscience, his heart, his whole being, were sublimely committed into God.
"God is love," and the "Father loveth the Son," and those connected with Christ find themselves wrapped in the same eternal affection shown by God to His Dear Son.
CONCLUSION:
The 2-fold secret of Christian living is described by two phrases in verse 1 and 10 - "in Christ Jesus" and "if Christ be in you."
The Christian's will is to live in Christ a life pleasing to God.  The Holy Spirit dwells in us, empowering us to live such a life.
