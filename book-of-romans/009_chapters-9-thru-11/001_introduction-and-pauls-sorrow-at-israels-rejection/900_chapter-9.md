# ROMANS CHAPTERS 9-11

## Introduction to Romans 9-11

### The Theme

Remember the Structure of Romans?

- Introduction ----------------- 1:1-17
- DIVISION ONE:	Doctrinal ------ 1:18-8:29
- DIVISION TWO: Dispensational - 9:1-11:26
- DIVISION THREE: Practical ---- 12:1-15:33
- Conclusion ------------------- 16:1-2

Romans 9 Begins a the second of three major divisions to the Book of Romans. Chapter 8 concluded Division 1 which is primarily Doctrinal and Chapter 9 begins with Division 2 which is largely Dispensational.

In general, A dispensation is a way of ordering things&mdash;an administration, a system, or a management. In theology, a dispensation is the Divine administration of a period of time. A dispensation is in effect the mode and methods of how God chooses to deal with humanity ( or a part of it) for a period of time.

The Theme of this second Division is Dispensational in regards to Israel specifically and how God has dealt and will deal with Israel. The Theme is God's Sovereignty in His dealing with Israel. The Sovereignty and Righteousness of God is harmonized in these verses with His dealings with Israel specifically and all of mankind in general. 

## The Structure

1. The Sorrow of the Apostle at Israel's Rejection (9:1-5)
2. The Rejection of Israel and God's Sovereignty (9:6-29)
3. The Rejection of Israel and Human Responsibility (9:30-10:21)
4. The Rejection of Israel and God's Purpose for their Future (11:1-32)
5. The Apostle's Words of Praise of God (11:33-36)

## The Sorrow of the Apostle at Israel's Rejection (9:1-5)

Romans chapter nine talks about Paul’s sorrow for the Jews. We find out that not all of Abraham’s seed were the children of promise. 

> Romans 9:7,8&mdash;&hellip; Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.

This chapter talks about the calling of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews, as it had been foretold.

### The Sincerity of his feeling (1)

**Paul preached the truth! ** His Sorrow for the Lost was Sincere and Divinely Inspired.

1. Truth should be spken always
2. Truth is the Believer's Life (John 8:32)
3. Truth honors the Christ we serve.
4. Truth must be obeyed (Gal. 3:1)
5. Truth is necessary for growth. (Ephesians 4:14-15)
6. Truth is a defense.
7. We are begotten by the Truth. (James 1:18; 1 Peter 1:23
8. We are to Walk in the the Truth (II John 4)

### The Intensity of his feeling (2-3a)

**Paul carried the burden!** His Sorrow was intense - Great heaviness, Continual, Self-Sacrificing

Paul has experienced great heaviness in sorrowing over Israel’s condition as a whole. Paul comes to the place that he would even be willing to be accursed from Christ that his brethren might be found in Christ. This is a selfless declaration, but the proposition is not even possible. The sinner’s light in their darkness is the justified, sanctified, holy life of Believers that walk consistently in Christ and their own salvation is in Christ alone. 

Paul’s proclamation is reminiscent of Moses in Exodus 32:32,33.

> Exodus 32:32,33&mdash; Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.

### The Basis of his feeling (3b-5)

Paul has great sorrow for unbelieving Israel. Their unbelief is especially disheartening as they remained in their unbelief despite their great spiritual heritage. 

Paul lays out the Jews spiritual heritage as being eight-fold. To the Jew Pertains:

1.   **ADOPTION** - privilege of adoption  -  sonship 

God had chosen Israel over Ishmael. ... The Jewish legend of Isaac and Ishamael's argument over circumcision ...

2.   **GLORY** - Shekinah presence of God

3.   **COVENANTS** - Promises of God made to Israel

4.   **LAW** - Law given at Sinai

5.   **SERVICE** - Authorized worship as ordained by God

6.   **PROMISES** - Promise of God are (yea and amen) to them that believe

The Jew had the promises of God, they even trusted in the law but they overlooked Christ.

7.   **FATHERS** - Relationship to the Father (Fathers of the flesh)

8.   **MESSIAH OF ISRAEL**

The written word  Rom. 3:2  oracles of God committed unto them. Rom. 9:5  Christ came in the flesh

There are over 400 prophecies concerning Christ in the Old Testament that were fulfilled in the New Testament.

Christ is a rock of stumbling to the Jew.

> Galatians 5:6&mdash;For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

John 14:15; 1 Peter 2:7,8

### The Righteousness of his Feeling

Paul makes it clear that his intense and sincere desire is all Israel be saved (Romans 9:1-5; 11:26; 10:1)

God desires that all sinners be saved (1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9; Ezekiel 18:23; Matthew 23:37).

> 1 Timothy 2:4&mdash;Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

Paul is righteous in his desire and not contrary to mind and will of God.

## The Rejection of Israel and God's Sovereignty (9:6-29)

### The True Israel is According to the Promise, v. 6-10

The majority of Israel has missed the point. Christ is the fulfillment of the law, but Israel stumbles over him as if a stone and hold to their laws and religion. They think they are the children of God because they are the children of Abraham and Isaac and that they are the ones to whom the law was revealed. 

The fact that the Jews as a nation rejected the Messiah (Christ) raises the question "Did the Word of God fail?"  "Did God fail to carry out His promises"?  How does Paul answer these questions?  In these next verses Paul is confident that Israel's rejection of the gospel is not unanimous and not permanent&mdash;God is able to graft back in again!

The real Israel is the elect, not a natural seed.  We see the plan of God as it unfolds. Not everyone that is born a part of the nationality of Israel are a part of Spiritual Israel. The children of the Israel are only children of the flesh, but the children of the promise are the children of God. (John 3:6 "born of the Spirit"). The New Testament Church is referred to as “the Israel of God” (Galatians 6:16) because of their faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ&mdash;not because of their family lineage.

> Romans 9:6-10&mdash;Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: 7 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 8 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. 9 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son. 10 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; 

> Romans 10:1 ¶ Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. 3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.

### Election or Predestination is Not of Works of Him that Calleth, v. 11-13

Election is mentioned in verse eleven. 

> Romans 9:11-13&mdash;(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) 12  It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

Election or predestination is not an unrighteous act for God may justify whom He may and condemn whom he desires. All the good works of men cannot make them children of the promise, but that condition is dependent upon God showing mercy. 

It is important to understand from Scripture how predestination or election works.

Predestination and election is based upon God’s foreknowledge. He knows the end from the beginning He knows who will receive and who will reject before they are even born. 

> Romans 8:29&mdash;For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

> William Branham was a man of God and a tent preacher in the mid 1900’s. He was preaching one evening in the tent and a woman came to him near the closing of the service. She said, “Brother Branham, my husband has threatened to kill me if I came to your meetings, again. He is sitting right now in his car in the parking lot holding a shotgun.” Branham went out to the vehicle pulled open the passenger side door and sat down in the front seat. He plead with man concerning his soul for an hour or more. Branham, observing no change in the man, asked one final question. “Do you any intention that at any time in the future you may serve God?” The man arrogantly sounded a resounding, “No!” Branham told him that he saw no reason for him to continue living then, and snapped his fingers and the man died instantly in the driver’s seat. 

Some are given 100 years and others only a few. It is man’s responsibility to respond in the time of mercy for turning to God cannot happen just on a man’s whim, but he must be drawn by the Father. 

> John 6:44&mdash;No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.

### God is Righteous in Mercy and Hardening, v. 14-18

> Romans 9:14-18&mdash; What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 15 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 16 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. 17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. 18 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.

How is God's sovereignty expressed? God is a sovereign God so therefore he is also a just God.

### Clay in the Potters Hand, vs. 19-24

#### 1. God is Just v.19

> Romans 9:19&mdash;Thou wilt say then unto me, **Why doth he yet find fault**? For **who hath resisted his will**? 

- Exodus 6:2-9 Pharaoh Resisted but only for a time.
- Numbers 22 (18,35,38) Balaam
- Hosea 4:11,12 Israel 

#### 2. God is Sovereign (and Man is Responsible) v.20

> Romans 9:20&mdash;Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? 

- Jeremiah 27:1-11 Jeremiah's Sermon on the Bonds and Yokes (28:1-4)
- Jeremiah 25:8-11 & Jeremiah 25:12-15 Babylon

Galatians 5:19-21	
Acts 5:29

#### 3. God is Purposeful v.21

> Romans 9:21&mdash;Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? 

Compare with JEREMIAH 18 "Go Down to the Potter's House

> Jer 18:1-10&mdash;The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. 3 Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. 4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. 5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 6 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel. 7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; 8 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. 9 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 10 If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.

#### 4. God is Right

- Hypothetical "A" v.22

> Romans 9:22&mdash; What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: 

- Hypothetical "B"  vs.23-24

> Romans 9:23&mdash;And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

Note well the word afore.  For the whole process of our salvation is viewed from that blessed future day when we shall enter, through divine mercy, into that glory which God afore appointed us. 24 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?

2 Timothy 2:20-21
1 Peter 5:8 
Matthew 25:1-10
Galatians 5:4 

### The Calling of God's People, v. 25-29

> Romans 9:25-29&mdash;As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. 26 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God. 27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: 28 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. 29 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

#### Verse 25

Paul here, takes from the prophet Hosea (2:23) a passage that is specifically spoken to Israel, but has not found a fulfillment in Israel but rather is seen fulfilled in the Gentiles receiving the Gospel.

> Hosea 2:23&mdash;And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.

- "I will sow her" Alluding to the import of the name Jezreel (v.22), the seed of God. (Jeremiah 31:27; Zechariah 10:9; Isaiah 61:3).

As a place, The city of Nazareth, Jesus' home town, was on the northern side of Jezreel. It is also called the Great Plain and the Valley of Esdraelon. 

In the Bible, the city of Jezreel has a long, violent history. The wife of King Ahab, Jezebel, died when she was thrown from a window of Jezreel's palace, and her body was eaten by dogs (2 Kings 9:30-35). Naboth was murdered in Jezreel when he refused to give King Ahab his vineyard (1 Kings 21:1-23). King Ahab's sons were beheaded and their heads piled at the gates of Jezreel (2 Kings 10:1-11). Jezreel was also the scene of many biblical battles: Deborah's victory over Sisera (Judges 4); the Israelites' victory over the Midianites and the Amalekites (Judges 6—8); Saul and Jonathan's defeat at the hand of the Philistines (1 Samuel 31); Egypt's victory over King Josiah (2 Kings 23:29). 

The Jezreel Valley is now a beautiful farmland, where wheat, cotton, corn, and sunflowers are grown, and herds of sheep and cattle graze. The Valley of Jezreel is also called "The Valley of Megiddo" (Meggido is found within the valley of Jezreel. Meggido means to slaughter or cut off.) and some believe it may be the scene of the battle of Armageddon, according to a passage in Revelation that says "they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon" (Revelation 16:16-21). The word Armageddon is a combination of the word har, meaning mountain or mountain range, and mgiddown, which in English is "Megiddo."

The word "Jezreel" is constructed of two Hebrew words meaning "to sow" and "mighty" or "Almighty" and in combination the meaning is "God will sow."  Jezreel is the name Hosea gave to his oldest son in 1:4 which was prophetic. He represented the righteous seed that was and would be sown in Israel. 
 
- The sentences in the latter part of this verse are very abrupt, but exceedingly expressive; leaving out those words supplied by the translators: I will say to NOT MY PEOPLE, THOU MY PEOPLE; and they shall say, MY GOD.

> 1 Peter 2:9,10&mdash; But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 10 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

#### Verse 26

Here we see the Gentile people.  God's infinite grace takes up those who were once called "dogs" (Matthew 15:26) and gives them a heavenly calling "Called to be children of the living God."

> Hosea 1:10-1&mdash;Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. 11 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

#### Verse 27

Verse 27:	Here the apostle quotes another prophet, Isaiah. Isa. 10:22 - concerning a remnant.

> Isaiah 10:22 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.

"remnant" from 2641; a remainder, i.e. (by implication) a few:--remnant. 

#### Verse 28

The ways of God are not our ways.  He waits long - He forbears - He is silent: then suddenly puts into execution an eternally formed purpose.

"Cut short in righteousness."

> Ezekiel 20:35,36&mdash;And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face. 36 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

- Cut it short - This word here means to "execute it speedily." The destruction shall not be delayed. (Hebrews 4:12 "cut")

#### Verse 29

Verse 29:	This verse is a quote from Isaiah 1:9 shows that if God had not intervened by his grace, they would have all become as Sodom and Gomorrah.

> Isaiah 1:9&mdash;Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

>  2 Thessalonians 2:7&mdash; For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

## The Rejection of Israel and Human Responsibility (9:30-10:21)

### Stumbling and Overcoming

The Conclusion of Chapter 9, v.30 - 33

#### Righteousness Through Faith, v. 30

> Romans 9:30&mdash; What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.

The Gentiles, not following after righteousness (righteousness by the Law), attain to it by faith.

- RIGHTEOUSNESS [dikaiosune]: "righteousness; justification" Romans 1:17; 3:5,21-26; 4:3-13, 22; 5:17,21; 6:13-20; 8:10; 9:28-31; 10:3-10; 14:17

> Matthew 5:6&mdash;Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.

>  Romans 1:17&mdash;For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

>  Romans 3:22&mdash;Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

>  Php 3:9&mdash;And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:

- FAITH

Faith is contrasted in the text in this way:

Seeking righteousness by the keeping of the Law versus seeking righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ.

"pistis" found in 228 verses. persuasion, i.e. credence; moral conviction (of religious truth, or the truthfulness of God or a religious teacher), especially reliance upon Christ for salvation; abstractly, constancy in such profession; by extension, the system of religious (Gospel) truth itself:--assurance, belief, believe, faith, fidelity. 

#### No Righteousness Through the Law, v. 31

> Romans 9:31&mdash;But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.

Verse 31:	Israel followed after the law of righteousness but could not attain it. (Could not keep the law) Israel, following after the Law - stumbled at the (by faith) way.

#### Must Seek Righteousness By Faith, v. 32

> Romans 9:32&mdash;Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;

Israel did not seek it by faith.

#### A Stumblingstone is Laid, v. 33

> Romans 9:33&mdash;As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

Stumbled over the rock of offense. - Stumbled over Jesus -

NOTE:   The only way to have Christ in your life is to believe on Him.  Otherwise he is a "rock of offense".  He offended the leaders of Israel by exposing sin.

What is the message of the Gospel that is open to all?

"And whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."

God's mercy is illustrated by His dealings with both Jew and Gentile.  Humility and awe are the proper attitudes for both Jew and Gentile who experience the mercy and kindness of God.

Whether a man is a Jew or a Gentile, his salvation depends upon more or less than what he thinks and does with Jesus.

Submission to God's way of righteousness by personal acknowledgement of Jesus as the risen Lord, brings a man into "Right standing with God".

Why was Christ a Rock of Offense? 
Why is Christ a stumblingstone to the sinner today?

### Salvation for the Jews vs. 10:1-21

##### THEY ARE NOT SAVED "they might be saved", v. 1

> Romans 10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.

- The Jew First, The Gospel is FOR the Jew

> Romans 1:16 ¶ For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
<!--->
> Romans 2:9 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 
<!--->
> Romans 2:10 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: 

- The Majority of the Jews Rejected the Gospel

> Acts 2:22&mdash;Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: 23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:

- The Pharisees Rejected the Gospel

The first persecution of Christians organised by the Roman government took place under the emperor Nero in 64 AD after the Great Fire of Rome. So the first, perseuction of Christians was largely from the Jews.

> Acts 9:1&mdash;And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 2 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. 

SMITH's BIBLE DICTIONARY: The Pharisees were a religious party or school among the Jews at the time of Christ, so called from the Hebrew word perushim, "separated." The chief sects among the Jews were the PHARISEES, the SADDUCEES and the ESSENES, who may be described respectively as the Formalists, the Freethinkers and the Puritans. ... Christ's teaching was in some respects thoroughly antagonistic to theirs. He denounced them in the bitterest language. (Matthew 15:7,8; 23:5,13,14,15,23; Mark 7:6; Luke 11:42-44 compare with Mr 7:1-5; 11:29; 12:19,20; Lu 6:28,37-42)

1. The first portion of the Talmud is The MISHNA or "second law," which was given by Moses ORALLY to explain and complete the written Law given to Moses on Mount Sinai.  It eventually came to be esteemed far above the sacred text. 
 
2. The Pharisees, upon the Pretence of maintaining the Law of God intact, multiplied minute precepts and distinctions to such an extent that the whole life of the Israelite was hemmed in and burdened on every side by instructions so numerous and trifling that the law was almost if not wholly lost sight of. These "traditions" as they were called, had long been gradually accumulating.
- Detailed washings before they could eat bread, 
- bathing when they returned from the market; 
- How they washed cups, pots, brazen vessels
- fastings demanded twice in the week, 
- and extensions of the law of the Sabbath, which must have converted God's gracious ordinance of the Sabbath's rest into a burden and a pain.  Mt 12:1-13; Mr 3:1-6; Lu 18:10-17 
 
3. Jesus taught that true piety consisted not in forms, but in substance, not in outward observances, but in an inward spirit. The whole system of Pharisaic piety led to exactly opposite conclusions. Mt 6:2,6,16;
 
4. With all their pretences to piety they were in reality greedy, materialistic, and lax in morals. 

> Mt 23:25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.

("Love they neighbor as thyself") Lawyer asked "Who is My neighbor"? Lu 10:29 
 
Finally, instead of endeavoring to fulfill the great end of the dispensation whose truths they professed to teach, and thus bringing men to the Hope of Israel, they devoted their energies to making converts to their own narrow views, who with all the zeal of proselytes were more exclusive and more bitterly opposed to the truth than they were themselves.

> Matthew 22:15&mdash;Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. 

5. The Pharisees at an early day secured the popular favor and thereby acquired considerable political influence. This influence was greatly increased by the extension of the Pharisees over the whole land and the majority which they obtained in the Sanhedrin. They advanced their agenda through political means.
 
6. One of the fundamental doctrines of the Pharisees was a belief in a future state. They appear to have believed in a resurrection of the dead, very much in the same sense: as the early Christians. They also believed in "a divine Providence acting side by side with the free will of man." 
 
7. Josephus compared the Pharisees to the sect of the Stoics. He says that they lived frugally, in no respect giving in to luxury. We are not to suppose that there were not many individuals among them who were upright and pure, for there were such men as Nicodemus, Gamaliel, Joseph of Arimathea and Paul.

#### The Jews' Ignorant Zeal, v. 2

> Romans 10:2&mdash; For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. 

- The Pharisees: Minute Prescriptions added to the Law

> Acts 23:6 ¶ But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
<!-- -->
> Ac 26:5 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
<!-- -->
> Php 3:5,6 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;

Paul does not ignore their efforts. He Witnesses to their "ZEAL OF GOD". 

ZEAL: "heat", enthusiasm, passion; fervent mind, indignation, jealousy. John 2:17; Acts 5:17; Acts 13:45; 2 Corinthians 7:7; 11:2

#### The Jews' Ignorance, vs. 3-11

They had a zeal of God, but were missing important truth -- The Righteousness of God which is by faith. The Object of this faith is Jesus Christ the only begotton Son of God Who is the End of the Law Through Faith. This faith comes by the Word of God and does not require ascending to Heaven or Hell first, but is already nigh.

> 3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. 5 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. 6 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) 7 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) 8 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

#### The Jews' Path to God, vs. 12-15

> 12 ¶ For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! 

#### The Jew's Rejection of the Gospel, v. 16-21

> 16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? 17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 18 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. 19 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. 20 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. 21 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

(Isaiah 65:1)

God sends a preacher -> a preacher preaches -> an audience hears -> the hearer believes -> the believer calls on the name of the Lord -> the Lord saves him.

Where is the DISCONNECT? "They have not obeyed or heeded the Gospel"

Did God send a preacher? YES (v.19, 20, Moses, Isaiah, etc.)
Did the Preacher Preach? YES (v. 16, report or PREACHING)
Did the Audience Hear? YES (v. 18, Moses Foretold, Isaiah Foretold)

The Hearers refused to believe. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN GOD's PLAN OF REDEMPTION.

> Isaiah 65:1&mdash;I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name. 2 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;

God is using the Gentiles to provoke the Jew to Jealousy (v.19).

National survey shows Jews leaving Judaism, assimilating, becoming Christians or “Nones” --- October 1, 2013

Jews who are Christian now are one of the major components of the U.S. Jewish population.

By Tony Carnes

The number of adult Jews who identify their faith as Judaism has dropped by about half since the late 1950s.

Currently, the number of Judaic Jews is 1.8%. In 1957 the U.S. Census found that 3.2% of the U.S. adult population identified their religion as Jewish.

The Pew Research Center found that Jews of no religion make up 22% of Jews and .4% of the U.S. adult population. In total Jews make up 2.2% of the U.S. population, about 5.3 million adults.

Jews Religion

Low religious practice and belief

Two-thirds of Jews do not belong to a synagogue, almost one-third identify with no Jewish religious denomination, and one-quarter (23%) do not believe in God. 

Younger Jews are shifting to “no religion”

Jewish Millennials, those born after 1980s, are the most likely to identify themselves as not religious. 32% say that they would describe themselves as having no particular religion or are agnostic or atheist. Alan Cooperman, deputy director of the Pew Center, called the drop in religious identity a “stunning” development. The shift to “None” in religion reflects a long term trend among American Jews.

Rise of the Messianic Jews

Jews who are Christian now are one of the major components of the U.S. Jewish population. 1.7 million adult Jews identify themselves as Christians. Only the denomination of Reform Judaism has more support among American Jews, with an estimated 1.86 million adherents.
