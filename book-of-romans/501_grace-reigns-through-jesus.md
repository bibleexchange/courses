# Grace Reigns ” THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST” 	Ch. 5

## Introduction

A person has access into the grace of God and therefore justification by faith in God's provision.

The very opportunity for faith to receive this provision is possible as a result of God's love and grace demonstrated in Christ’s Atoning death.

We were shut out by the law in its judgment on sin, but access to and good a standing in the grace of God, is gained by faith in Jesus Christ. 

Paul is emphasizing in this Chapter the role of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Believer’s justification and them having favor with God or “grace.” 

So we get's the credit for salvation? Jesus!

It is not merely even a work of faith that pleases God alone, because no such opportunity for faith to work is even possible without Christ. It is based upon the merits of Christ that God provides the opportunity for man to be saved. 

## “Through Jesus” (God's Son)		Vs. 1-5

The sinner is in bondage and cannot enjoy the fulness of God's intended blessing fro him. He is held back.

When a man places his faith in Christ and in His atonement for their sin, that person is provided through Jesus many wonderful treasures that enable him to abound in the Grace of God. 

SCRIPTURES ON ABOUNDING: Proverbs 28:20; Romans 5:20: 15:13; 2 Corinthians 8:7; 9:8; Philippians 1:9; 4:17; 1 Thessalonians 3:12; 4:1; 2 Peter 1:5-8

> Romans 5:1 ¶ Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 3 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; 4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope: 5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

### We have been Justified through His blood (saved)

### We have Peace with God (reconciled)

### We have Access into Grace

### Access into the presence of God. 

### We Rejoice in the Hope of the Glory of God

### We Joy in Tribulations (as it works patience->experience->hope)

ILLUSTRATION: William Wilberforce, (We have received an abundance of His Grace)

> Young William Wilberforce was discouraged one night in the early 1790s after another defeat in his 10 year battle against the slave trade in England. Tired and frustrated, he opened his Bible and began to leaf through it. A small piece of paper fell out and fluttered to the floor. It was a letter written by John Wesley shortly before his death. Wilberforce read it again: "Unless the divine power has raised you up... I see not how you can go through your glorious enterprise in opposing that (abominable practice of slavery), which is the scandal of religion, of England, and of human nature. Unless God has raised you up for this very thing, you will be worn out by the opposition of men and devils. But if God be for you, who can be against you? Are all of them together stronger than God? Oh, be not weary of well-doing. Go on in the name of God, and in the power of His might." 

### We have the love of God shed ABROAD in our hearts

### We have the Holy Ghost given unto us



## Christ’s Atonement (The Blood)		Vs. 6-11

### Vs. 6 

All of the preceding blessings (justification, peace, access, etc.) are possible because, “When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.” It is the Blood of Jesus Christ that satisfied the Law. Not only the merit of Christ provides man the favor of God, but also the atoning work of His blood. The fact that Christ was righteous and is righteous is not enough alone to justify man. A price had to be paid for sin and Christ paid that price with His own blood.

### Vs.7,8 

Man’s “love” is self concerned and limited. For those that are religious and do good things you might find some to die and for those that are kind to others and generous, you might have an easier time finding someone to die , but Christ died not for those who appeared to have value and worth, but he died for the worst, he died for the offenders, trespassers. He died for SINNERS. 

#### Scarcely for a Righteous Man Will One Die---  coldness.
#### Peradventure for a good Man Some would Dare to Die--- warmth.
#### Christ Died for SINNERS---those that have offended and have erred.

### Vs. 9-11

We Have Reason to Joy in Jesus Christ: We are justified by His blood, Saved from Wrath through him, Reconciled to God by His death, Saved by His Life, Atonement is by Him


## Contrasting the Reign of Sin and the Reign of Grace	Vs. 12-18

### Sin Imputed & Sin’s Reign		Vs. 12-14

### The Free Gift				Vs. 15-18

Paul draws a powerful contrast of the reign of sin and the reign of grace:
Contrasts in Romans Chapter Five
Sin’s Effect	Christ’s Provision
Sin	Righteousness
Death	Life
Law	Grace
Enemies	Reconciled
Disobedience	Obedience
Judgment	Justification
Condemnation	Justification of Life
Wrath	Peace
Sinners	Saved
Sin’s Reign	Grace Abounding

Condemned men are slaves to death by Adam.
Justified men will reign in life by Christ.


## Conclusion – “By Jesus”			Vs. 19-21

Just as sin reigns unto death, Grace reigns through Righteousness unto eternal LIFE. Just as the Law has authority over those that break the law, so Grace has power and authority over the righteous. (They have received this position of righteousness by the abounding of God’s grace.) Just as believer’s have the power and authority to reign in life they shall have the power and authority to reign in eternity.
Adam’s sin abounded by the abiding condemnation of the law and reigned unto death. God’s Abounding Grace reigns through His Abiding Righteousness by Jesus Christ our Lord unto life

This is GRACE- Love as seen in the death of Christ for the ungodly. Love as seen in the life of Christ for those whom He has saved through His death.

This is Condemnation-Condemned men are slaves by death to Adam. In Adam all men were condemned to death.

This is Justification-Justified men will reign in life by Jesus Christ. In Christ all men are made alive
