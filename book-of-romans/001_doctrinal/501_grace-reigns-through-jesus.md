# Grace Reigns "THROUGH OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST&quot; 	Ch. 5

## Introduction

A person has access into the grace of God and therefore justification by faith in God's provision.

The very opportunity for faith to receive this provision is possible as a result of God's love and grace demonstrated in Christ&apos;s Atoning death.

We were shut out by the law in its judgment on sin, but access to and good a standing in the grace of God, is gained by faith in Jesus Christ. 

Paul is emphasizing in this Chapter the role of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Believer&apos;s justification and them having favor with God or &quot;grace.&quot; 

So who get's the credit for salvation? Jesus!

It is not merely even a work of faith that pleases God alone, because no such opportunity for faith to work is even possible without Christ. It is based upon the merits of Christ that God provides the opportunity for man to be saved through faith. 

## Through Jesus (God's Son)		Vs. 1-5

The sinner is in bondage and cannot enjoy the fulness of God's intended blessing for him. He is held back.

When a man places his faith in Christ and in His atonement for their sin, that person is provided through Jesus many wonderful treasures that enable him to abound in the Grace of God. 

SCRIPTURES ON ABOUNDING: Proverbs 28:20; Romans 5:20: 15:13; 2 Corinthians 8:7; 9:8; Philippians 1:9; 4:17; 1 Thessalonians 3:12; 4:1; 2 Peter 1:5-8

> Romans 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 3 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; 4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope: 5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

### We have been Justified through His blood (saved)

### We have Peace with God (reconciled)

### We have Access into Grace

### Access into the presence of God. 

### We Rejoice in the Hope of the Glory of God

### We Joy in Tribulations (as it works patience->experience->hope)

ILLUSTRATION: William Wilberforce, (We have received an abundance of His Grace)

> Young William Wilberforce was discouraged one night in the early 1790s after another defeat in his 10 year battle against the slave trade in England. Tired and frustrated, he opened his Bible and began to leaf through it. A small piece of paper fell out and fluttered to the floor. It was a letter written by John Wesley shortly before his death. Wilberforce read it again: "Unless the divine power has raised you up&hellip; I see not how you can go through your glorious enterprise in opposing that (abominable practice of slavery), which is the scandal of religion, of England, and of human nature. Unless God has raised you up for this very thing, you will be worn out by the opposition of men and devils. But if God be for you, who can be against you? Are all of them together stronger than God? Oh, be not weary of well-doing. Go on in the name of God, and in the power of His might." 

### We have the Holy Ghost given unto us

> Romans 5:5 &hellip;.the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

> 2 Corinthians 1:22&mdash;Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.

> Ga 4:4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

> Ephesians 1:13-14&mdash; In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

### We have the love of God shed ABROAD in our hearts

> Romans 5:5 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

## Through God's Love		Vs. 6-10

### Motivated by Love Vs. 6 

All of the preceding blessings (justification, peace, access, etc.) are possible because, &quot;When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.&quot; It is the Blood of Jesus Christ that satisfied the Law and His Love was the motivation for His action.

### Uncommon Love Vs.7,8 

Man&apos;s &quot;love&quot; is self concerned and limited. For those that are religious and do good things you might find some to die and for those that are kind to others and generous, you might have an easier time finding someone to die , but Christ died not for those who appeared to have value and worth, but he died for the offenders, trespassers. He died for SINNERS. 

#### Scarcely for a Righteous Man Will One Die--- coldness.

> 7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die:&hellip; 

Principled but "Cold" reasoning-- Does he deserve my substitution? (MERIT OF MORAL CHARACTER but nothing endearing about the person.)

#### Peradventure for a good Man Some would Dare to Die--- warmth.

> &hellip;yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. 

I really like this person, "He's a good man. He has been good to others. ENDEARING."

#### Christ Died for SINNERS---those that have offended and have erred.

God's Love was demonstrated to those neither RIGHTEOUS nor GOOD.

> 8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

In our place &hellip;

> Romans 6:23&mdash;For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

> ILLUSTRATION: 

### Love worked for Reconciliation Vs. 9-10

#### At Odds with God -- The Condition of those for Whom Christ Died

- Without Strength - Dying, powerless.
- Ungodly - No God in them.
- Sinners - Always aiming, but missing the mark.
- Enemies - Hostile Toward God and His Holiness.

We are saved from Wrath through Jesus, who motivated by love, has provided Justification through His blood.

> Romans 5:9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 10 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.

#### **reconcile**: 

##### Meaning of Reconciliation

> STRONG's: "to change mutually, to compound a difference:"

> BAKER's Dictionary: "The meaning common to this word group is "change" or "exchange." Reconciliation involves a change in the relationship between God and man or man and man. It assumes there has been a breakdown in the relationship, but now there has been a change from a state of enmity and fragmentation to one of harmony and fellowship. "

> ENGLISH DICTIONARY - *compound*: "To come to terms; agree."

When I'm reconciled to God, the change that is made is in me and the terms are God's.

> 2 Corinthians 5:17&mdash;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

> Isaiah 1:18&mdash;Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. 19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: 20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

##### Ministry of Reconciliation

Reconciliation has to do with man's relationship with God. 

- We have a Received the Ministry/Service of Reconciliation

> 2 Corinthians 5:16-21&mdash;Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. 17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the **ministry of reconciliation**; 

	In reconciliation, God changes man thoroughly. This change is the WORK OF GOD. The "all things new" are of God as in creation God spoke the earth into existence and the the earth has its source in God. It is God reconciling the world unto Himself.

- We have been made Ambassadors of the Office (committed the Word of reconciliation)

> 19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. 20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.
 
- Man's sin already separates him from God, but to us has been committed a great word of reconciliation
 
> 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

## Through Christ&apos;s Atonement Grace Reigns (The Blood) (Vs. 11-21)

### We Joy in God Through Jesus, the provider of Atonement vs. 11

> Romans 5:11 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

The facts that God is Love and Christ remains righteous is not enough alone to justify man. A price had to be paid for sin and Christ paid that price with His own blood--the Atonement.

In verse 11 through 18, Paul draws a contrast of the Reign of Sin and the Reign of Grace.

### Sin Imputed & Sin&apos;s Reign		Vs. 12-14

> Ro 5:12-14&mdash;Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 13 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
 
### The Free Gift				Vs. 15-21

> Romans 5:15-18&mdash; But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. 16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. 17 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) 18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. 19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. 20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Conclusion &mdash; &quot;By Jesus&quot;			Vs. 19-21

Just as sin reigns unto death, Grace reigns through Righteousness unto eternal LIFE. Just as the Law has authority over those that break the law, so Grace has power and authority over the righteous. (They have received this position of righteousness by the abounding of God&apos;s grace.) Just as believer&apos;s have the power and authority to reign in life they shall have the power and authority to reign in eternity.
Adam&apos;s sin abounded by the abiding condemnation of the law and reigned unto death. God&apos;s Abounding Grace reigns through His Abiding Righteousness by Jesus Christ our Lord unto life

This is GRACE- Love as seen in the death of Christ for the ungodly. Love as seen in the life of Christ for those whom He has saved through His death.

This is Condemnation-Condemned men are slaves by death to Adam. In Adam all men were condemned to death.

This is Justification-Justified men will reign in life by Jesus Christ. In Christ all men are made alive

Paul draws a powerful contrast of the reign of sin and the reign of grace:
