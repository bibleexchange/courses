# Paul’s Introduction to Romans - Ch. 1:1-17

## Paul’s Salutation					1:1-7

### His Position, vs. 1, 5

> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God

Paul gives his credentials:

#### Paul

Paul was born Saul about 1 AD in Tarsus.  Saul is a Hebrew name meaning “demanded; prayed for.” Paul is a Latin name meaning “small; little.” The changing of Saul’s name to Paul is not explained in the Scripture but is simply and matter-of-factly stated in Acts 13:9. There is an undeniable connection between Paul’s Gentile name and his strongly Gentile ministry. (I Timothy 2:7)
Saul’s hometown of Tarsus was a great center of learning in the ancient world likened to the cities of Athens and Alexandria, but Saul was raised in Jerusalem under the tutelage of the great teacher Gamaliel, a Pharisee and a member of the Sanhedrin. (Acts 22:3) Gamaliel was a doctor of the Jewish law. (Acts 5:34) It was under the mastery of this great rabbi that Paul was infused with a great zeal for Jewish Law which led to his persecution of Christians. Saul eventually became a member of the Sanhedrin and was also a Pharisee. Saul’s training also made him an expert on Jewish Law. He was well-equipped to answer later on his Christian ministry any accusation or question of the Jews.
Tarsus was particularly favored by the Roman Empire. Jewish citizens of Tarsus could receive Roman citizenship. Saul of Tarsus was a Roman citizen. The privileges of Roman citizenship included the right to vote, the right to have a legal trial, the right to appeal lower court decision at the higher court levels and in cases of alleged treason the right to be tried in Rome. A Roman citizen could not be tortured, whipped or condemned to death unless convicted of treason. In Acts 22, Paul’s Roman citizenship prevented his death and even a scourging. 

#### A Servant of Jesus Christ

Paul, a free-born Roman citizen chooses to identify himself as a doulos or “bond-servant” of Jesus Christ. A “bond-servant” is one bound to another by honorable ties for life. The New American Standard Bible Greek Lexicon includes the following statement in its definition of “doulos”: “devoted to another to the disregard of one's own interests.”
The writers of the New Testament used the title “servant” often as a name by which they expected to be known. Christ commanded His disciples in Mark 10:44, “And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.” Paul’s writing of Romans was with great authority not because of his credentials, but because of His Master Whose ambassador he was. Paul made his plea known based on Christ’s Lordship and the blessing of the Believer’s voluntary service to Him. Paul’s heart and spirit rang in trueness with John the Baptist’s declaration and was a world apart from the theologians and “Doctors of Divinity” who strive for masteries. John the Baptist declared speaking of Christ in John 3:30, “He must increase, but I must decrease.” The heart of a true servant exalts its Lord and not itself.
A teacher asked, “How can you tell if you have a servant attitude?” “By the way you react when you are treated like one,” was the reply.  As a servant of the master, you must be willing to take all that the Master has taken (John 15:18; 17:14).  Sometimes we might have to wash windows, or even someone’s feet. Christ wants more than just words (John 13:5-17). If you want to be great in the Kingdom, learn to be the servant of all! 
Paul is a slave to the “savior” (not the “king”). He tells us more in chapter 12.

#### Called to be an Apostle

An apostle is one who has been SENT FORTH as a messenger or representative of and fully authorized by the sender—a delegate or ambassador. (Acts 9:3-9, 15-22, 28) Paul’s calling was not earthly. He was not even a candidate in the vote taken in Acts 1, but Paul’s calling and sending forth as an apostle came from Christ. (1:5) Paul emphasizes that he was called to be an Apostle; this calling was by God and not by man.

> Galatians 1:1—Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)

#### Separated Unto the Gospel of God

##### “Separated” – Paul’s ordination is given in Acts 13:1-4.

##### “Unto the Gospel of God” 

Paul was a “preacher of the Gospel”. He was a separated messenger with a special Message. The Gospel is a mystery (Mark 4:11; I Tim. 3:9,16; Col. 2:2; 4:3; Eph. 1:9) and a Divine revelation.  (Acts 9).

Absolute consecration is spoken of in these words. Paul was set apart to preach one message and only one message. Paul did not declare a message that exalted himself nor did he do a work to further his position in the eyes of men. Paul declares that his purpose in life was the Gospel of God, and so should this be our purpose as ministers of the Gospel.

<!-- Step #17 -->

### His Message, vs. 1-5

Paul’s message is the Gospel. The Gospel does not originate from Paul and is wholly concerned with Jesus Christ: our Lord, seed of David, Son of God, resurrected.

#### Preached by His Apostles          	vs. 1,5
#### Promised “by his prophets”         vs. 2 (Isa. 53:11; Jer. 23:6; 33:16)
#### Made of the Seed of David			vs. 3
#### Revealed through the Holy Ghost    vs. 4

NOTE: The Gospel does not rest on the incarnation, but on the resurrection of Christ.

<!-- Step #18 -->

### His Readers, vs.6-7



#### The called of Jesus Christ:

Those connected to Jesus are connected with Him by His calling. The Called that Paul is writing to does not simply mean those invited, but means those invited that have come.

#### All that be in Rome, 

##### It is unquestionable that the recipients of this epistle were the Roman Christians.

Romans 1:7&mdash;To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints&ellip;
Romans 1:15&mdash;&ellip;I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

##### The Christians at Rome were Predominately Gentile.

Scripture seems to point to a predominantly Gentile Roman church as Paul’s manner of addressing the church leaves hardly any doubt that he is writing to Gentiles. 

In chapter one, Paul speaks of his apostleship for obedience of the faith among all the nations (1:5). He refers to the recipients as "other gentiles" and also gives as his reason for being ready to preach the Gospel to them as that he is debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians (1:14), and that the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation, though to the Jew first, yet to the Greek also (1:16).

> 1:13&mdash;I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

When the position and prospects of the Jewish nation are under review and Paul comes to admonition, it is to the Gentile believers that he addresses it.

> 11:13—For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: 
> 15:15-16— Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God, 16 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

#### Beloved of God, 

Sinners should believe that God loves them; but , saints should know they are the “beloved of God”. The unsaved are never called “God’s Beloved.”

#### Called to be saints: 

The family of God comprises of saints called out of the world by God’s grace to be His own people. (I Cor. 1:2) Saints are those who are set apart for worship and praise. 

Another word key to understanding the meaning of “saints” is “sanctified.”Saints are directly opposed to sin. Saints are those who allow holiness to become a reality in their lives. True righteousness is a phenomenon of the will. True righteousness always produces outward action and inward results. Every form of sin must be put out of the heart. As moral agents our intellect must disapprove of sin. By an act of the will, saints renounce ALL sin; by the miracle of God’s grace, saints overcome ALL sin.

Notice the italics in this clause. The Greek word translated “called” is interpreted to mean “invited” but it also could be used to express “made, constituted.” We could properly render this clause “made saints.”

#### Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

This is a common greeting of Paul in his epistles. The title “Jesus Christ our Lord” or “Lord Jesus Christ” is used ten times in Romans. Jesus is the personal name as Savior. Matt. 1:21. Christ is “God’s anointed one” Lord denotes He is Lord of all things in heaven and earth (Acts 10:36).  Jesus Christ our Lord is the Master of every situation!














<!-- Step #19 -->

## Paul’s Readiness (to Visit, Impart & Preach)	 1:8-15

Verses 8-15 express Paul’s personal feelings for the Roman saints. 

### Paul is thankful for the faith of the Roman saints and so prays for them. Vs. 8,9
	
The whole world is in reference to the domain of the Roman Empire which often referred to itself as the whole world. It was Augustus who made the decree at the birth of Christ that the whole world should be taxed, which was in reference to the dominions of Rome. 

The faith of the saints in Rome was spoken of throughout the entire Empire. These Roman Christians are the "Beloved of God", "Called to be saints",  and recipients of the grace and peace "from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Their testimony bears out that they are separated unto God and represent the King of Glory. What a treasure a good testimony is! Paul stands on the battleground in prayer that their faith and testimony would continue.

### He has a great desire to visit the Roman saints and impart spiritual gifts unto them because of his motive to see the church established. Vs. 10,11,12

Rome was strategic, but Paul is led by the Spirit and not statistics. It is probable that Paul realized the strategic value of building up the church in the capital city of the Roman Empire, but Paul was a caliber of minister that would invest as heavily in a city no one ever heard of. He was blessed to hear that there were saints in Rome and desired to visit them to do his part to strengthen the church there.  

It is logical that a Revival in the city of Rome would have impact on the entire Empire, but the truth is, anywhere God manifests is power could potentially turn the world on his head. 

> Acts 17:6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;

Paul did not push others down to exalt himself a little higher, but he sought and worked for there to be MUTUAL faith, equal experience, in and with God. Paul knew that God had called him that others would follow in the same path of faith as their testimony grew. (Rom.1:6; I Cor. 3:21-23)

<!-- Step #20-->

### Paul had been hindered from going to Rome. Vs. 13,14,15

Was "let hitherto"in v.13 means *to hinder* or *to prevent*. He had wanted to and even planned to go, but he had been hindered.
	
Paul would one day go to Rome as a prisoner to stand before the Roman leaders and proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the Jews and the Gentiles. The book of Acts tells us that Paul dwelt two years in Rome; it is believed that he was under house arrest during this time of being in Rome. He would again return to Rome as a prisoner in AD 67 where he was beheaded under the persecution of Nero.

Paul had great desire to preach the Gospel in Rome. He uses the word debtor in reference to himself to show that he is committed to preach to all men.- V. 14 (“opheiletes” obliged - transgress against God if he did not go.) He was a debtor to the sinner to tell him about Christ. To preach to all classes – Greeks; Barbarians&hellip;

“Greeks” is used to refer to the wise Gentiles who have been educated in Greek culture and philosophy.

“Barbarians” is used to refer to those outside of the Greek 	culture, that would not have been educated. It was usually applied to foreigners, who Paul also describes as being unwise referring to their lack of education. This phrase then has reference to the entire Gentile world.

It matters not Greek, Jew, Barbarian, wise, or unwise, Paul, is ready to preach to them. Paul was indebted to Greek and Jew, there was no difference because the Gospel makes no difference, but is for both the Greek and Jew. 

[SEE: http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/jew.htm (origin of the name JEW)]

Paul proclaimed as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.-V. 15 This means he was ready to go and preach with all that was within him; well knowing that he would face opposition to the Gospel message. 

Paul demonstrated the spirit of a True Prophet –Ambassador – Oracle-Messenger of God: “I am ready to preach the gospel to you.” We see Paul has a genuine pastor’s heart, as well. (1:11-17; 9:1-3; 15:23-24)

NOTE: "ready <prothumos>" means 'forward in spirit, predisposed; ready, willing.' Matthew 26:41; Mark 14:38

### Consider the Question: What some of the Building Blocks of Revival?

Paul knows a genuine Gospel is the seed for a move of God.

## Memorize Romans 1:16,17

A helpful tip while memorizing Romans 1:16,17 is to say it out loud. Just as writing a verse out can help in memorizing it, so speaking the words aloud is an excellent way to burn them into your memory. One person suggested turning the radio off during your commute to work or school each day and reciting your memory verse out loud instead!

> [Romans 1:16,17] <br>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: <br>for it is the power of God unto salvation <br>to every one that believeth; <br>to the Jew first, <br>and also to the Greek. <br>17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed <br>from faith to faith: <br>as it is written, <br>The just shall live by faith.

2. What Scripture was Paul possibly quoting in Romans 1:17?

<!-- #22 -->
## Paul’s Theme: The Gospel			1:16-17

Verses 16 & 17 are the key verses of this epistle and are a summary of the epistle.  

> Romans 1:16-17—For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.  

### The Gospel is the power of God unto Salvation.

#### All who believe can be changed by the power of God.
	
The Scripture declares that the Gospel of Christ is to everyone that believes. Some falsely teach that God chooses only certain people to be saved. The Gospel is not for only a selected few, but for whosoever will come and drink of the waters of life. Whosoever believes in Jesus shall have everlasting life. – Jn. 3:16 All men have the ability of believing, but all men will not choose to believe in Jesus and accept the provision of redemption through His blood.    
 
#### Salvation is a work of God.

Man can do nothing to save himself; he was born in sin with no human means of hope. Man could not be good enough to satisfy the law of God. He is guilty and condemned to hell. There is no price that man could pay to purchase his Salvation. Salvation is a work of God given by grace and received by faith in Jesus Christ. Many complicate the simplicity of the Gospel and cannot accept that sinful man can be made new and transformed by the power of God as he reaches out in faith to the nail scarred hands of Jesus.

#### It is essential to preach the Word of God.

Paul is ready to preach to whosoever unashamed because he knows beyond all doubt that the GOSPEL OF CHRIST is the POWER of God unto salvation to the Jew first and also to the Greek. There is salvation by no other, but in that holy name, Jesus. (Acts 4:12) Paul’s last message to Timothy was: PREACH THE WORD. There is life in the Word. It is the truth of the Word that will make men free. 

### The Gospel reveals the righteousness of God from faith to faith.

#### Righteousness comes from God.

##### Man has no righteousness of his own.

Isaiah 64:6—But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

##### The righteousness of Christ is put to the account of the 	sinner. 

This is what is meant by imputed righteousness. Impute is a KJV word that means to set to the account of.  ILLUSTRATION: A man who has no money in the bank needs someone else to put money into his account. And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness:-James 2:23  Abraham had the righteousness of God put to his account. (Rom. 4:3)   God views the repentant through the blood of Christ.

##### Righteousness is received by faith at Salvation.

There is a difference between imputed righteousness and imparted righteousness. To impart means to put into. God places His righteousness in man at Salvation. There is a change of nature that accompanies the new birth.

> Philippians 3:9—And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:

#### From faith to faith indicates a progression of faith to receive more revelation of the righteousness of God.

The expression from faith to faith is referring to an increase of faith; showing growth from the initial faith of salvation to a greater faith in God that comes with Christian growth. The Scripture tells us that every man is given the measure of faith. – Rom. 12:3. All men have the ability to believe, yet all do not exercise their faith to believe in Jesus Christ. The apostles asked the Lord to increase their faith. - Lk. 17:5. Faith is increased as it is put into practice. With Christian maturity comes an increase in faith. The righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith through the Gospel. 

#### The Righteousness of God is progressive in the life of Christians.    

The revelation of God’s character and nature is not something apart and separate from the Gospel, but is bound up in the Gospel that we as hearers may LIVE. This life and righteousness is not received all at once, but is revealed to us from faith to faith. As we obey and do as we have received, God gives us more and this continual progression in righteousness is the path of life of the JUST. The key to maintaining our experience with God is progression. Paul declares in Hebrews 6:1, “Let us go on.”

> II Corinthians 5:21—For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

### The just shall live by faith. 

#### Paul builds the theme of the epistle on the foundation of Scripture.
	
"As it is written" is in reference to Habakkuk 2:4 from where this statement is quoted.  

#### The just are those who have been justified by God through faith.
	
The just refers to those who have been set in a right relationship with God through the atonement provided by Jesus Christ. Those who are saved are the just or those who have been justified. 

Habakkuk contrasted the Chaldean whose trust is in himself and will fall because of it with the just who "supports himself, by a firm expectation of the deliverance of Zion" (quote John Wesley) and will be saved in the end.

#### There must be a continuance of faith in order to continue living the Christian life.

#### The Christian is kept by the power of God.
	
The just remain so by the keeping power of God. In this world of sin, the Christian needs the preserving power of God to keep him on the straightway that leads unto life.  Jesus said that no man could pluck the sheep out of His hand.- Jn.10:28 This does not  mean that God ever takes away the choice of man. Christians must choose to serve God, to live is an everyday experience (The just shall live) that requires a continual receiving of God’s power by faith. 

#### The path of the just leads to full maturity in Christ.

> Proverbs 4:18—But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
> Psalms 119:105—Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

Light represents truth which guides the Christian on his journey. The further we walk on the path the more truth that is received. God reveals more truth as we obey the truth that has already been received. The life of the just is to continue by faith to mature in Christ and receive the fullness of our inheritance as believers.    

#### The Christian lives his life by faith in Christ.

> Galatians 2:20—I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

## Memorize Romans 1:18,19,20

A helpful tip while memorizing Romans 1:18,19,20 is to include the verse in prayer. When you pray, include elements of the verse. Pray that God will help you understand and apply the verse to your life. Making God's word a part of you and not just a string of words and sentences to quote is the real goal.

> [Romans 1:18,19,20] <br>18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven <br>against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, <br>who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
 <br>19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; <br>for God hath shewed it unto them. <br>20 For the invisible things of him <br>from the creation of the world are clearly seen, <br>being understood by the things that are made, <br>even his eternal power and Godhead; <br>so that they are without excuse:
