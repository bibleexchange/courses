- They Walk Not After the Flesh but After the Spirit

- They Walk with a New Mind

### They Walk in Liberty with No Condemnation 

> vs. 1 &mdash; There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

The deliverance Paul cried for in 7:24 is announced in 8:1. The quality of life before regeneration of the religious has some gruesome parallels, but the new man in Christ experiences great liberty. No longer condemned to die as the man bound to the corpse, for there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

Sin brought bondage, but the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has worked great liberty! ** OUR POSITION IN CHRIST includes freedom from condemnation.**

The first of the most needed messages of the bible!!!
&quot;the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death&quot;                       Ro 8:1&mdash;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.                                                                                                                       2&mdash;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

### They Walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit

The Righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us through following Christ by the leading of the Holy Ghost.

There are two ways to walk the path of life: 1) Following After the Flesh 2) Following After the Spirit of God. My will may not always be contrary to God&apos;s will, but to prioritize the flesh over the Spirit of God is the very recipe for failure. The carnal mind or the mind that is governed by that which is carnal is the very definition of rebellion against God. 

> vs. 7&mdash; Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

- Romans 8:13 Through the Spirit, Mortify the Deeds of the Flesh
- Galatians 6:8 Sow to the Flesh &hellip; Sow to the Spirit
- Romans 8:8 They in the Flesh CANNOT please God

To walk after the flesh is to not trust Christ as Savior and not follow him as Lord of all. Walking after the flesh is a lifestyle centered on myself.

> Colossians 1:9-10&mdash; 9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; 10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;

To walk after the Spirit, is to walk where He leads. This will require self-denial and involves a process of maturity.

In Galatians 5:16-26,  The "Fruit of the Spirit" are constrasted with the "Works of the Flesh".

> Both in history and in life it is a phenomenon by no means rare to meet with comparatively unlettered people who seem to have struck profound spiritual depths while there are many highly educated people whom one feels are performing clever antics with their minds to cover a gaping hollowness that lies within.--Herbert Butterfield.

God knows what He is doing, Follow Him.

### They Walk According to a New Law - The Law of the Spirit of Life

> vs. 2&ndash;3&mdash; For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

#### There are three laws mentioned here.

1. The Law of Sin and Death

It is like the law of gravity always pulling you down. It opposes that which is good and Godly. Brings you into bondage and condemnation. Bondage to sin makes you a servant to Satan. Serving the law of sin brings death. (Romans 7:22,23; 

2. The Law of God (Given Through Moses)

It is Righteous, good and Holy. It opposes sin and the works of the flesh. It brings you to conviction and decision. The law being weak cannot save but does point to Christ.

3. The Law of the Spirit of Life

This law is greater than the law of sin and death. It is the life of Jesus imparted to the believer by faith. Liberty is man&apos;s born again state&mdash;free to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. Serving the Lord brings more abundant life. Every Believer must manifest the Life of Jesus more and more. 

The Type
> II Chronicles 8:16 &mdash;Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the Lord, and until it was finished. So the house of the Lord was perfected.

The Antitype
> Proverbs 4:18&mdash;But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
<!-- -->
> Colossians 3:16&mdash;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

#### The  Nature of the &quot;Law of the Spirit of Life&quot;

Provides justification where the old law only condemned. Works liberty where the old law only worked bondage. It is a stronger law doing what the old law could not do in its weakness. (SANCTIFICATION, HOLINESS, RIGHTEOUSNESS) Christ was been made flesh and identified with the sinful. The old law could only stand from a distance as a school master with a pointed finger. This law works righteousness in the Believer; the old law could only identify unrighteousness. This life is subject to the law of God, whereas the flesh is not and cannot be for it is an enemy of God.

####  The Fulfilling of this "Law of the Spirit of Life.&quot;

> Romans 8:4&mdash;That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

It is fulfilled in the one that walks not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Also, in those that mind the things of the Spirit, and not the things of the flesh. It is pleasing to God, but they that are in the flesh cannot please God. If the Spirit of God dwell in you then His life is fulfilled in you, for you are no longer trying to serve God in the flesh, but have the Spirit of Christ to inspire and insure life. This life is not your own, but is Christ&apos;s life (Galatians 2:20). This Life is not debtor to the flesh, but to God to serve Him and obey Him (v.12). This Life is fulfilled in mortifying carnal deeds of the flesh (v. 13).

> James 1:25&mdash;But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

This is to be contrasted with confused theology around us ...

> ILLUSTRATION&mdash;:It is said that on his retreat from Greece after his great military expedition there, King Xerxes boarded a Phoenician ship along with a number of his Persian troops. But a fearful storm came up, and the captain told Xerxes there was no hope unless the ship's load was substantially lightened. The king turned to his fellow Persians on deck and said, "It is on you that my safety depends. Now let some of you show your regard for your king." A number of the men bowed to Xerxes and threw themselves overboard! Lightened of its load, the ship made it safely to harbor. Xerxes immediately ordered that a golden crown be given to the pilot for preserving the king's life -- then ordered the man beheaded for causing the loss of so many Persian lives!

Whenever a struggling Believer is caught up in the "do's" or "do not do's", go back to the cross. The blood of Jesus and the sanctifying power of the Spirit is effective against sin! The Fulfillmnet of Righteousness of God in us, is the fruit of a life abiding in Christ.

### They Walk with a New Mind -- minding the things of the Spirit and not the things of the Flesh

> 5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. 6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. 7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. 8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. 

Those in Christ do things differently&mdash;both actions and thoughts. They walk/act following after the Spirit of God. Walking after the Spirit also includes minding the things of the Spirit. 

The Spirit of God will govern us unto life, but the flesh will govern to death and self-destruction.

The spiritual mind produces life: A Mind Focused on Truth will Have Faith, A Mind Focused on the Work of Christ in Them Will Have Hope (myself and others), A Mind Focused on God's Favor Toward Itself Will Have Love.

#### It Makes a Difference What, How and How Much You Think

It makes a difference what you think.         	Motive                                                                                                                                                                                            It makes a difference how you think.          	Mindset                                                                                                  It makes a difference what you dwell on.		Meditation

- Are we spiritually or carnally minded?

> Luke 10:40&mdash;But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. 41 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:  42 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

The peace of God will rule in a mind steadfast on Him.

> 2 Thess. 3:16 Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
<!-- -->
> Isiah 26:3&mdash;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee

- How Weighty is the Will of God to my process?

Is my mindset in tune with the Lord? Is my thinking in alignment with the Word of God? Is our walk right with God?

- Do I Dwell Often on the Word of God?

The peace of the Believer is oftened threated by the Believer failing to look to the Promise and Promiser. Where in Romans 8 can we turn for the following promises?

1. No Fear of Condemnation to Sentence you.
2. No Fear of Accusation
3. No Fear of Separation from the Love of Christ
4. No Fear of Failing to Please God
5. No Fear of Slaughter by the Enemy

### Ye are in the Spirit, if the Spirit is in You

> Romanss 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

<!-- -->

> Romans 8:11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.                     

#### The Holy Ghost dwelling in you

> 2 Corinthians 6:16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
<!-- -->

Will the Holy Ghost Dwell in an unclean temple?

> 1 Corinthians 6:18-20&mdash;Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. 19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.

<!-- -->

> 1 Corinthians 3:17&mdash;If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

#### Dwelling in the Holy Ghost

A.	Be obedient to the Word in all things

> 1 John 5:7,8&mmdash;For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
<!-- -->
> Romans 8:1&mdash;There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.                                                                                                                                            
<!-- -->
> Col 3:16&mdash;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.                     
<!-- -->
> John 14:23&mdash;Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.                                                 
<!-- -->
>John 15:7&mdash;If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
 
B.	Be subject to the Spirit in all things&mdash;FOLLOW                                                            

Submission is requires action. Stay, Go, Believe ...

C.	Be led by the Spirit in all things&mdash;WALK WITH HIM

> Romans 8:28&mdash;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.                                                                                                                                 
<!-- -->
> Romans 14:17&mdash;For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.                                                                                                                                                                               <!-- -->                                                                                                                                                                                   > Romans 14:19&mdash;Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.

D. Through a Disciplined Prayer life & a Dedicated Mind to the Spirit God will Fulfill His Righteousness in Us

> Ro 8:2&mdash;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.   4&mdash;That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
                                                                                                                                               > Romans 1:5&mdash;By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                > Romans 16:26&mdash;But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:    
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                              > 2 Corinthians 10:5&mdash;Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
                                                                                                                                              
Romans eight sets forth that part in our salvation which is exercised by the third person of the Godhead, the blessed Holy Ghost.  Without Christ's work on the cross there would be no salvation, and without the presence and constant operation of the Holy Ghost, there would be no application of that salvation to us. Righteousness in life is possible through power of the Holy Ghost.
