## Patiently Wait for the Adoption, vs. 17-25

>  17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. 20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. 24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? 25 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

### Christian Maturity

#### The Enemy of Maturity

The doctrine of "sameness" is not only prevelant in secular arenas but is pervasive in Christian thought. After full inspection, this doctrine is oppositional to the doctrine of perfection.

> 1 John 3:1-3&mdash;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.

<!-- -->

> Galatians 4:1-5&mdash;Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. 3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: 4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 6 And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 7 Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.

<!-- -->
> 2 Peter 1:4&mdash;Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.

The Christian is to be developing and maturing. We are not all the same in that respect. We all mature differently.

#### The Doctrine of Maturity - Perfection - Completed Righteousness - The Redemption of Our Body - Manifestation of the Sons of God

- God's Work is not Complete in the Believer at Regeneration & Justification

> Romans 8:23 &mdash;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body

We need to grow and Christ is the standard.

> 2 Peter 3:18&mdash;But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen. 
<!-- -->
> 1 Corinthians 13:9-12&mdash;For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. 11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
<!-- -->
> James 1:2-4&mdash;My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 3 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
<!-- -->
> 2 Corinthians 3:18&mdash; 18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 
<!-- -->
> Ephesians 4:13&mdash;Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

##### The Evidence of Maturity

> Romans 8:14&mdash;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

- “led” (controlled) by the spirit.
- Divine Guidance is the Scriptural evidence of Maturity and Sonship.
- There is a difference between Divine guidance and natural reasoning, circumstances or impressions.
- Sons of God - "Sons" means adult sons - sons that have come of age

###### The Explanation of Maturity

> 1 Peter 2:1-2&mdash;Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, 2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:

###### Greek Words in New Testament Translated Child and Related Terms

1. teknon - that which is born (boy or girl)
2. teknion - child (term of endearment)
3. huios - son, male (origin, relationship to the father)
4. pais - son or daughter (in relation to law) boy or girl (in relation to age) a servant or maid (in relation to condition)
5. paidon - young or little child (term of endearment)
6. paidarion - (a lad, little boy or girl)
7. nepios - (not old enough to speak)
8. brephos - an embryo
9. korasion - young girl (term of endearment)
10. neaniskos - young man (20-40 years old)

##### The Development of the Child

- **Unborn** - "gaster" in the belly, "with child", unborn
1. Not Yet prodouced
2. Developing within the Body of the mother

> 1 Thessalonians 5:3&mdash;For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.


- **Child** - "teknon" not fully mature, still in the process of development
1. Not in the place to receive the full inheritance

Until the time apointed by the faither (Galatians 4:1-2) and ready to be revelated in the last time. (1 Peter 1:4,5; Luke 21:28; Ephesians 1:14; Romans 8:22,23)

2. It does not yet appear what we shall be (1 John 3:2)

A. "Now are we the sons (teknon) of God." The KJV uses the word sons to denote "teknon" which is never a mature son, but a younger child. We are now the sons (teknon) of God, who are not yet in the place to receive their full inheritance, but when HE SHALL APPEAR, WE SHALL BE LIKE HIM. Notice the text does not say "after He appears" but "when He appears". Ephesians 5:25-27 A READY & PREPARED PEOPLE.

B. In the last days, God is perfecting a people to bring them into their full inheritance.

- **Son** - "huios" a mature son, a placed son ( connected with the inheritance)

The Manchild is a fully mature son of God, a placed son, who is walking in fulll in heritance rights. 1 Peter 1:4,5; Ephesians 1:14; A Perfect man. Ephesians 4:12-13; Matthew 5:48;


### The Meaning of Adoption

In Romans 8:14-16 and Galatians 4:1-5, we are introduced to a deeper concept which is adoption, the manifestation of the sons of God. We understand that every man is BORN into the family of God (John 3:3), so what is this "adoption" all about? 

#### Adoption in Roman Law

Adoption is the legal action by which a person takes into his family a child not his own with the purpose of treating him as and giving him all the privileges of his own natural child. An adopted child is legally entitled to all rights and privileges of a natural-born child.

According to the Roman legal system the person who was adopted into a family gained all the legal rights of a legitimate son in the new family, but he lost all the rights, privileges and responsibilities in his old family. He was now an equal with the other sons and daughters in his new family. He was a co-heir with them according to the law. He was regarded as a new person who had a new life in a new family.

Another wonderful thing about the Roman law was that the old life of the adopted son was completely wiped out. All of his debts were cancelled. His past now had nothing to do with him. He was in a new relationship with a new family.

#### Adoption in Jewish Law &amp; Custom

There was no Jewish adoption law, and when a man died without male offspring to continue his line, there were other provisions made. This was different from Roman law which allowed a man to create an heir from outside his family.

Although no official Jewish law of adoption we can see the principles of adoption were not lost to the Jews as in the cases of:

- Abraham and his servant Eliezer (Genesis 15:2-4)
- Moses (Exodus 2:10)
- Genubath (1 Kings 11:20)
- Esther (Esther 2:7)

#### Adoption in Relation to the Believer

The Greek word for adoption (huiothesia) means to "place as a son" and is used only by Paul in the New Testament. Paul uses this word five times in his letters.

> Romans 8:15&mdash;For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
<!-- -->
> Romans 8:23&mdash;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
<!-- -->
> Romans 9:4&mdash;Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;
<!-- -->
> Galatians 4:5&mdash;To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
<!-- -->
> Ephesians 1:5&mdash;Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
<!-- -->

Adoption in Paul's letters is expansive. It includes the principles of "placement in the family of God" as for each Believer is a work completed, but it also speaks of a work not yet done. In Romans 8:23, Adoption is something the Believer who has received the firstfruits of the Spirit does "wait for".

The "Adoption" for which the Believer patiently waits has to do with placing the fully matured and fully developed into Sonship. This thought combined with the manifestation of the sons of God (v.19) speak of God’s ultimate plan in salvation. He is desirous to have many sons like His only Son. We often refer to this plan as End Time Salvation. 

End Time Salvation is God’s plan of salvation in its totality, salvation to the uttermost, of the whole man—body, soul, and spirit—which in time past was not an available provision because of the appropriateness of time. It is now made available to us living in the end times (or, the time of the end).

It is communicated throughout Scripture through many different thoughts. Listed below are some of the thoughts included in End Time Salvation: 
- End Time Deliverance
- Full salvation
- Apolutrosis: Complete State of Release
- Adoption: The Placing of Sons (Sonship)
- One Hundred Fold Christian
- Full Grown
- Manifestation of the Sons of God
- Fully Mature Sons of God
- Perfect Man
- The Bride of Christ
- Overcomer
- Completeness of Personality
- Complete Sanctification
- Man-child

### Closer Look at the Text Itself (verses 17-25)

>  17 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. 20 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  21 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 22 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 23 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. 24 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? 25 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.

Ephesians 4:13—Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

Mat.6:33; Mk. 4:20; Ro. 8:15-23; Eph. 1:13, 14; Colossians 1:22; Hebrews 7:25; Rev. 3:21; 19:7



I Peter 1:5—Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. (The signs surround us; we are in the “last time.”)

I Corinthians 2:10 “But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.”

I Peter 1:10-12 “Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
    Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.”
Hebrews 11:39,40 “And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.”

Paul emphasizes the importance of our relationship with Christ

Children in the natural grow up together as a family; Parents address them as children.
Believers will find themselves calling God "Father" in their prayers and communion.          Children - tekna - Begotten of God through His word by Holy Spirit, and are partakers of His nature.				Adoption is for Adult - sons - huios







////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
A. Walking after the Spirit is Liberty			Ch. 8
Romans chapter eight deals with our position in Christ.  We are free from sin and death. 
The law of sin brought bondage, but the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has worked great liberty!  OUR POSITION IN CHRIST is free from condemnation.
1. 8:10-16	Mortify the Deeds of the Body, Ye shall Live
2. 8:17-25	Hope of Adoption as Joint Heirs
3. 8:26-28	The Spirit Helps our Infirmities
4. 8:29-30 	The Hope of Glorification
5. 8:31-39	None Shall Stand Against Us, It is God that Justifies
The end of the chapter deals with the Christian’s Hope, which is; “If God be for us who can be against us.”  And that we are more than conquerors and that all things work together for good. The sufferings we go through are to teach us our motives.  


----------------------------------------
 




What the Christian can look forward to.
8:17	If children - than heirs.     We have legal inheritance rights.
8:14 speaks of adult sons.
8:17 speaks of born ones - those who are born of the Word and of the Spirit.
Iv. HOPE OF SUFFERING
Sufferings in comparison to glory.  (If we suffer we shall also reign)
8:18	The Glory revealed (in) us.
8:19	"Creature waiteth"		Earnest expectation within.



Hope and faith is part of Christian living.
8:20	For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of Him who subjected it in hope.
(God has a vast plan, reaching on into eternity, and "hope" lies ahead for creation.)
8:21	"The creature shall be delivered."
From bondage of corruption (although we are new creatures in Christ, yet God has left our bodies as a link with the present creation)
8:24 – 25  Hope - something you know will transpire in your soul.
		- Patience - wait for it.     (Good things come hard in life)
8:26 Holy Spirit helpeth our infirmities.       Our divine helper;   Spirit - breath of God
1.  Prayer - (spirit prays) understood by God.                                                                                               2.  According to His will - the spirit knows how to pray.
8:27	Jesus our intercessor.     - Go between -     Mediator                                                                                                 8:28	Providential Care.  "All things work together for good"  to them that are called.
Called does not mean invited.  "the called" are seen to be a company whose mark is neither religious response nor intellectual apprehending, but the electing grace of God.
Called according to His purpose                                           God is infinite; man, a bit of dust
God has a purpose, (a fixed intention)                                                                                        It will come to pass.


God's major purpose in life of the Christian
8:29	Predestinate                                                                                                                                                     He did also predestinate                                                                                                            Fore-Know foreknowledge                                                                                                                     Predestined to be conformed to His image




God acts toward the believer.
8:30	Called:     Them He also called   (called to be like God)                                                                              8:30	Justified:
1.  Freed from sin.                                                                                                                 2.  Positioned in Christ.
8:30	Glorified:	Eternal glory  - glory revealed in us


V. COMPLETE ASSURANCE     (Confidence in God – Security)




Six Questions
8:31	What shall we then say?  		(to these things)                                                                                      8:31	If God be for us?			(Who can be against us)                                                                                8: 32	Shall he not freely give us all things?	(He spared not His own Son)                                               8:33	Who shall lay anythings against God's elect? 	(It is God that justifieth)                              8: 34	Who is he that condemneth?	(It is Christ that dies, and is risen again)                                       8:35	Who shall separate us?		(From the love of Christ)

Is there anything that can separate us from the love of God?
8:38 - 39	"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	
There is a difference between knowing something and being persuaded of it.
Persuaded - There is a difference between knowing a truth and being heart persuaded of it.
Paul in his experience, had been through all these trials and tests.
Persuaded - His mind, his conscience, his heart, his whole being, were sublimely committed into God.
"God is love," and the "Father loveth the Son," and those connected with Christ find themselves wrapped in the same eternal affection shown by God to His Dear Son.
CONCLUSION:
The 2-fold secret of Christian living is described by two phrases in verse 1 and 10 - "in Christ Jesus" and "if Christ be in you."
The Christian's will is to live in Christ a life pleasing to God.  The Holy Spirit dwells in us, empowering us to live such a life.
