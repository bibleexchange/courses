#### Because of Christ's Work, I have Life 8:10

> Romans 8:10—And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

Death is the Result of Sin; Sin = Death, Righteousness.

Because of sin, your body is subject to death, but because of righteousness your spirit is subject to life! -- “the Spirit is life because of righteousness”

Comparison of Translations: 

- New International Version: But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.

- New Living Translation: And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life because you have been made right with God.

- English Standard Version: But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

- Berean Study Bible: But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet the Spirit gives you life because of righteousness.

- New American Standard Bible: If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.

#### Because of the The Holy Ghost’s Work, I am Alive 8:11

> Romans 8:11&mdash;But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

The Holy Ghost raised Jesus from the dead. The Holy Ghost quickens the mortal body of those He dwells in. The mortal body that is subject to death is made alive by the Holy Ghost.

Christ in us and His life and Righteousness abounding in us is evidence of our faith and of Christ’s works within us.

Quicken - vitalize - bring to life – make alive

A. The Spirit gives life by freeing the believer from sin and death.
B. The Spirit gives life by doing what the law could not do.
C. The Spirit gives life by condemning sin in the flesh.
D. The Spirit gives life by Christ providing Righteousness for us.

#### Because I am Alive, I Work 8:12-13

> Romans 8:12-13&mdash;12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. 13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

"THERE FOR" Christ's Work + Holy Ghost's Work = I am alive and a debtor to God.

We are debtors to life - we are obligated and behold to the Holy Ghost and not to the flesh
