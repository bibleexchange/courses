# The Law in a Right Perspective - Romans 3

## Introduction

### Memorize: Romans 3:27,28

> Romans 3:27<br /> Where is boasting then? <br />It is excluded. By what law? of works? <br />Nay: but by the law of faith. <br />28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified <br />by faith without the deeds of the law.

###  In Chapter 3, we have five principles concerning the Law:

#### In Chapter 1

Paul introduces himself and his desire to visit the church at Rome and then introduces his subject of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. In this Gospel, the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith and the wrath of God is revealed against those who reject the Gospel. 

#### In Chapter 2

Paul establishes that knowledge of the law is not enough to save (Not hearers but doers are justified**) and resting or boasting in knowing the law is foolish. All are guilty under the law; those who have the law will be judged by it and those who have not the law will perish without it. 

**Paul clarifies that justification is not for those who keep the letter of the law, but for those we are a Jew inwardly (2:29). The Law of Circumcision that is essential to justification is a procedure of the heart and spirit.

#### In Chapter 3

Paul sets the Law in its right perspective. The religious Jew clung to his knowledge of the law of Moses as if it were a charm that justified them before God. They had a warped perspective of what the law is and does. Jesus did not and Paul does not eliminate the law as worthless, but does position it properly in the perspective provided by the revelation of the cross. In Judaism, the law is king, but according to the Gospel there is righteousness and justification without the deeds of the law. 

This conviction in the pre-eminence of the law is what fed the Jew’s objection to Christ. The Holy Ghost knew the Jews were holding to their superiority and trying to justify their rejection of the Gospel. In Romans 3, we find refutations of the excuses of the Jews to further show they are condemned and in need of Jesus.

- The True Advantage of Having the Law	(vs. 1-2)
- The Absoluteness of the Law 			(vs. 3-8)
- The Unbending Authority of the Law 	(vs. 9-19)
- The True Purpose of the Law 			(vs. 20-30)
- The Establishing of the Law			(v. 31)

### What Law?

The word “law” generically means “a principle; a prescription”. Though it was to the Jew who was given the Law of God through Moses, both Jews and Gentiles had the law of God in their conscience (whether or not they chose to receive it was their choice). 

Throughout Romans, Paul illustrates the weakness of the Law given to Moses and yet at the same time establishes his true value. The Law given to Moses is indeed the will of God, but it is not the entirety of his instruction. The error of the Jew was in that they made those principles with its ceremonies and attached traditions the sum of God’s intent toward humanity.

Though we can find the same word “law” used in 52 verses in Romans, Paul is not always discussing the same set of principles or prescriptions.

- Romans 2:12-13,17,18,20,23,25,26 : The Jews had the Law of Moses and the Gentiles did not. The Jews boasted and rested in the law given through Moses and because of the keeping of the deeds of this Law.
- Romans 2:14-15 : The Gentiles did have a law in their heart or their conscience
- Romans 3:27 : Law of faith.
- Romans 7:2  : Law of her husband
- Romans 7:22 : Law of God
- Romans 7:23 : Law of Sin
- Romans 8:2 : Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus
- Romans 9:31 : Law of Righteousness

Moses was used as an oracle of God, but he was not the only nor the last of God’s messengers. Ultimately, he was only trailblazer for the Living Word! The law in our conscience or the law given through Moses are both abstractions of the Law of God. God gave his eternal principles to Moses and God desires his will, his law, his prescriptions to be hidden in the heart of every person and realized in their life.

>  Romans 3:28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.

A man can be justified in the eyes of God without the deeds of the law of Moses (thief on the cross). A man is never justified if he is contrary to the mind of God.

> Romans 7:22&mdash;For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

## The True Advantage of Having the Law	(vs. 1-2)

> Romans 3:1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? 2 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.

Having Received the Law First, What Advantage does the Jew Have? (vs. 1-2)
### The Advantage IS NOT that they are inherently superior to the Gentiles
Justification by faith is a doctrine of equality of all men which the Jews despised due to their insistence on being superior to the Gentiles. The Jew wanted to flaunt his greatness over the Gentile. Many Jews continued to reject the Gospel and hold to their pre-eminence and exalted position in Jehovah simply because of their lineage to Abraham. Most Jews were appalled by the concept of the Gentiles being equal to them and having the same access to God as them through faith in Jesus.

### The Advantage IS they had first received the oracles of God.
	“Yes the Jew has an advantage, but it is not what you think!” 

Oracle literally means utterance and is used here to refer to the Words or utterances of God proclaimed through the prophets and preserved in the Holy Scriptures. The Jews had received the prophecies of the Messiah and therefore had an advantage of increased revelation of Messiah that the Gentiles did not have.  The advantage the Jew had was the very thing that condemns him as many still continue to reject Jesus as the Messiah.

> John 1:11&mdash;He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

The advantage of knowing the law is not that that knowledge justifies us, but is that by hearing of the Word of God to us is opened an opportunity to receive faith in God. We can know better and miss our opportunity to please God.

### Application

 > 2 Peter 2:21&mdash;For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.

Question: Is it an advantage to not know God’s will?
Answer: No. It is a blessing to have had the opportunity to know God’s will. Peter is expressing the greatness of the degree of condemnation of backslider. Both the heathen and backslider are condemned.

## The Absoluteness of the Law (Romans 3:3-8)
> ILLUSTRATION: Two truck drivers were traveling together hauling a 12’4” high trailer when they come up on an underpass marked ‘Clearance 11’ 3”. The first man asked his partner, “What do you think?”’ The second checked around for police and seeing none suggested, “Let’s give it a try.”

### The Standard is an Unchanging Christ

We have made a distinction between the specific prescriptions given through Moses and the much more encompassing Mind of God. It is a great error to make the Law of Moses as the entire prescription of God’s will. The fullness of God’s Will is much larger than the Law given through Moses. 

It is in Jesus, we see the fullness of God’s will. The Lord Jesus Christ is the standard of God’s expectation. 

> Eph 4:11-16 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: 16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.

For the purposes of our study we have defined The Law of God as:

>God’s standard of expectation for his creation.

God’s Law is governed by the nature of God. What is in the Law of God is because of Who God is. God is absolute and therefore His Law is absolute--his expectations of the behavior of humanity are absolute. (The majority of the time, Human self-government is anything but absolute.)
>  2 Samuel 22:31 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him. (Compare with Psalm 101)
### If some do not believe, will God break his promise? vs. 3-4
Has God cancelled his covenant with Abraham because some Jews are bad? If some do not believe does it hinder God’s plan? Will unbelief cancel God’s faithfulness? See II Timothy 2:13

#### The Jews Cling to their Heritage as Abraham’s Children as their Warranty. (v. 3)
	
Their objection was even though some did not believe; nothing can nullify our special promises we have been given by God through Abraham. They were in effect saying no matter what else we are, we are Abraham’s seed and that will get us into heaven.
#### The answer: Absolutely Not! (v.4)
Will God be unfaithful because man is unfaithful? Absolutely Not!
> vs. 4&mdash;God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar...
> 2 Timothy 2:13 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he **cannot deny himself**.

It is not because, some Jews were unfaithful that requires faith in Jesus Christ. It is because the fullness of God’s plan of redemption has always been in Christ.

>  Re 13:8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

#### Illustrated from David’s Life

> ...That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. (v.4) 
	
The Psalm of David is quoted which showed God to be righteous even when David was condemned for his sin. According to Psalm 51:4, God is just when He speaks and clear when He judges. This is used here to show that God is right to condemn the Jews because they rejected the Messiah who came from the seed of Abraham according to the promises. These promises they claimed would justify them in fact brought condemnation to the Jew because of their rejection of  Jesus Christ.

### If our sin commends God’s righteousness, how can He judge us?-Vs. 5-7

#### Let us first understand the meaning of the question.
	
Commend -To represent as worthy of notice, regard, or kindness; to speak in favor of; to recommend. – Webster  The Gk. word carries the meaning of to exhibit (as in a conspicuous manner), or to introduce, to stand with or to come into existence. 

We must rely on the context to help us understand the meaning of this question.  This is posed as two questions in the text and has been simplified for the purpose of study. The question is literally asking: if our unrighteousness magnifies or brings attention to God’s righteousness and mercy; is God unrighteous if He judges us?  

This is still awkward for us to understand. Remember God is dealing with the actual objections of the Jews. The objection is the same as the objection of many today. We could ask it this way: If God is so righteous why would He judge me for my sin and send me to hell? (Especially, because we are Abraham’s children.)

#### God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

The answer is: Certainly not. For if this principle is used then how could God pass judgment on the world? The world here is referring to the Gentiles. The Jews were still trying to excuse themselves from condemnation. It is proper for a righteous God to judge the unrighteous sinner&mdash;whether Jew or Gentile. 

The truth is, God can judge the world because he is righteous. 

### Let us do evil that good may come? – Vs. 8
Some abuse the truth of God’s mercy and boast that their sinful lives and God’s unconditional acceptance, is illustrative of God’s great Mercy. Paul was NOT preaching this false doctrine, but was being accused of doing so.

This was an attack on Paul’s preaching of justification by faith. The Jews were saying: you tell us God justifies the wicked, so why not continue to be evil so good can come out of it? 
Paul’s description of those who did preach this was: whose damnation is just. Since the accusation was not true Paul did not go into a detailed answer; he only affirms that God’s judgment on them is just.

### Application

Is it ever right to do wrong?
