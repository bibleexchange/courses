This chapter also emphasizes that the Law of God is holy.\r\n\r\n### Division: Three Sections:\r\n\r\n#### Verses 1&ndash;6: Died that You May be Married to Another\r\n#### Verses 7&ndash;13: The Law is Holy, And Just and Good\r\n#### Verses 14&ndash;25: Paul&apos;s Captivity to the Law of Sin \r\n\r\n## Dead that You May be Married to Another (vs. 1&ndash;6)\r\n\r\n> Romans 7:1&mdash;Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?\r\n\r\n### Meaning of the Illustration\r\n\r\nThe sinner is in a binding relationship to his sin as a wife to a husband. \r\n\r\n### The Power of the law is terminated\r\n### The Difference of the Union with Jesus Christ\r\n### The Service of the Union with Jesus Christ\r\n- Serve with newness of life\r\n- Serve in newness of Spirit\r\n- Serve with new power\r\n- Serve as a new creature\r\n\r\n### The Fruitfulness of this Union\r\n\r\n#### Our union with sin disabled us unto death.\r\n\r\n#### Union with Christ enables us to bring forth fruit of Righteousness unto Holiness.\r\n\r\n## The Law is Holy, And Just and Good (vs. 7-13)\r\n\r\nIn Romans 7:7-13, Paul establishes the goodness of God&apos;s Law and the wickedness of sin. Paul is writing to the Jew, those who understand the law (vs.1), and properly frames the purpose and nature of the Law. Service to the letter of the Law cannot make one righteous, but in its exactness it awakens the sinner to his need of Christ. \r\n\r\n### Question: Is the Law Sin?\r\n\r\n> Romans 7:7 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? \r\n\r\nWhy Would Paul Ask this question? Paul had written in verse 6 that the law was something he was delivered from. This would seem to infer that the law is \"bad\".\r\n\r\n> Romans 7:6 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.\r\n\r\n> ILLUSTRATION: Henry Ironside and the young indian man.\r\n\r\n### Short Answer: No, The Law has a Good Purpose\r\n\r\n> vs. 7 &hellip; God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. \r\n\r\nThe main theme of chapter seven is the believer&apos;s relation to the law. The believer is united with Christ &quot;the new husband.&quot; When we are born we are bound to the law like as a marriage. To be free from the law, because the law will never die or change we must die. We become dead to the law by the body of Christ, which allows us to marry him that is raised from the dead, even Jesus Christ. We are delivered from the law to serve God in the newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.\r\n\r\nServing in the oldness of the letter of the law did not make Paul righteous but rather exposed his unrighteousness, but it was not the cause of his sin. The Law, like a schoolmaster, taught him what was sin. By society's standards, Paul was not guilty unless he followed through on his lust, but the law communicated God's standards which by result exposed the depravity of his heart. \"Thou shalt not covet\" (v.7). How can I be told not to \"want\" something that is in my nature? The law requires exact and complete obedience without exception. In the light of the law of a Holy God, sin is utterly and completely exposed wherever it can be found. \r\n\r\n> Adam Clarke \"His law is his will. It recommends what is just, and right, and good and forbids what is improper, unjust, and injurious. \"\r\n\r\nThe law reveals the fact of sin\t\r\n\r\n> Colossians 3:5&mdash;Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\n> I Thessalonians 4:5&mdash;Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:\r\n\r\nWhat would be the results of a world without law? The law is representative of order, security, stability, faithfulness, uniformity, equality. Absence of the law produces chaos, with its attendant evils. If the laws of nature were to stop what would be the results? The End of the world. \r\n\r\n### Sin Brought Death\r\n\r\n8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, \r\n\r\n-- A Starting Point, an opportunity\r\n\r\nPaul personifies sin and in so doing abstracts sin from the person. The sword of the spirit is cutting a discerning division so that we might see we can be free from sin! If sin is characterized as a fiend waiting to pounce and take advantage of someone, then that someone can given the right situation, deny that sin. The murderer is within the sinner. But, if sin is merely the automatic reactions of nature, how can righteous judgment be made?\r\n\r\nWhat was the opportunity that sin took advantage of? The law defines the sinner as DEAD in his sins. Being DEAD, the rebellion of sin takes advantage to work more death &hellip; \"wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.\"\r\n\r\n### For without the law sin was dead. \r\n\r\nThe Law is like a plumb-line: It shows where and what we are in the sight of God. It is intended to awaken the sinner to his need for Christ. The Law then becomes the conductor to Christ in order that we may be justified by faith.\r\n\r\n#### 9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. \r\n\r\nThe law reveals the power of sin. Under the law, a man becomes condemned to death because of sin.\r\n\r\nRomans 7:5 describes the state of a Jew as in the flesh serving sin which considered as being under law -- cursed.\r\n \r\nDeuteronomy 27:26; 28:15; Ps 119:21; Jer 11:3; Ga 3:10\r\n- The curses were proclaimed principally to secure obedience to the commandments.\r\n- The curses were never meant to destroy the individual but produce repentance.\r\n\r\n#### 10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. \r\n\r\nThe end result for Paul was that he who vigorously followed the law and served it tenaciously, was dead in sin! All his religion was a work in unrighteousness--in light of the cross, all the commands of God were a sentence of death.\r\n\r\n#### 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.\r\n \r\nThe law reveals the deceitfulness of sin. 11\r\n\r\nSin takes advantage of us and deceives us, The law of God is known in different ways: the ceremonial laws, the social laws, natural laws, moral laws and health laws.\r\n\r\nThe Jews believed you had to keep all of those laws to become holy. By the time of Paul's ministry, the rabbis had summed up all of the Old Testament law into 613 commandments. It is impossible to keep them all, especially since they had strained at the laws beyond the intention of God.\r\n\r\nThe law reveals the effect of sin. The effect of all sin is a spiritual death. The outcome of dying physically with unrepented sin is eternal separation from God.\r\nThrough the inability to fulfill the law the sinner becomes condemned to death under the law. A commandment cannot give life, but it can convict you of sin through the sentence of death and cause you to repent and seek Eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\r\n\r\n### 12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. \r\n\r\nThe Law itself is \"Holy and Righteous and Good\"\r\n\r\n- Holy because it discloses sin\r\n- Righteous because it condemns the sinner\r\n- Good because of its spiritual purpose (part of God's ultimate plan to bring man to himself)\r\n\r\n##### 13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. \r\n\r\n##### But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; \r\n\r\n#### that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.\r\n\r\nThe law reveals the sinfulness of sin.\t \t 12-13\r\n- The Law is Holy, Just and good, so as the standard, the plumb-line, the commandment shows us where and what we are in the sight of God; sin is shown for what it is &quot;exceeding sinful&quot;. Far off from the mark that God has set for us in Christ.\r\n- The law is intended to convict the sinner of sin and only through Christ find repentance.\r\n- The law condemns, convicts, constrains and conducts an awakened sinner to Christ. Rom. 3:19,23; 7:8-11; 8:3; Gal.3:19-24 (Judge, warden, executioner, conductor)\r\n\r\nSin can hide in society of men comparing one with another or else judging merely by the dictates of there own heart, but in the light of Perfect Holiness, sin becomes \"exceedingly sinful\".\r\n\r\n<!-- ////////////////////////////////////////////// -->\r\n<!-- ////////////////////////////////////////////// -->\r\n<!-- ////////////////////////////////////////////// -->\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION: Henry Ironside and young Indian man on Law and Grace\r\n\r\nSome years ago, I had a little school for young Indian men and women, who came to my home in Oakland, California, from the various tribes in northern Arizona. One of these was a Navajo young man of unusually keen intelligence. One Sunday evening, he went with me to our young people's meeting. They were talking about the epistle to the Galatians, and the special subject was law and grace. They were not very clear about it, and finally one turned to the Indian and said, \"I wonder whether our Indian friend has anything to say about this.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet and said, \"Well, my friends, I have been listening very carefully, because I am here to learn all I can in order to take it back to my people. I do not understand all that you are talking about, and I do not think you do yourselves. But concerning this law and grace business, let me see if I can make it clear. I think it is like this. When Mr. Ironside brought me from my home we took the longest railroad journey I ever took. We got out at Barstow, and there I saw the most beautiful railroad station and hotel I have ever seen. I walked all around and saw at one end a sign, 'Do not spit here.' I looked at that sign and then looked down at the ground and saw many had spitted there, and before I think what I am doing I have spitted myself. Isn't that strange when the sign say, 'Do not spit here'?\r\n\r\n\"I come to Oakland and go to the home of the lady who invited me to dinner today and I am in the nicest home I have been in. Such beautiful furniture and carpets, I hate to step on them. I sank into a comfortable chair, and the lady said, 'Now, John, you sit there while I go out and see whether the maid has dinner ready.' I look around at the beautiful pictures, at the grand piano, and I walk all around those rooms. I am looking for a sign; and the sign I am looking for is, 'Do not spit here,' but I look around those two beautiful drawing rooms, and cannot find a sign like this. I think 'What a pity when this is such a beautiful home to have people spitting all over it -- too bad they don't put up a sign!' So I look all over that carpet, but cannot find that anybody have spitted there. What a queer thing! Where the sign says, 'Do not spit,' a lot of people spitted. Where there was no sign at all, in that beautiful home, nobody spitted. Now I understand! That sign is law, but inside the home it is grace. They love their beautiful home, and they want to keep it clean. They do not need a sign to tell them so. I think that explains the law and grace business.\"\r\n","title":"01_702_law-holy-just-good.md","course_id":"book-of-romans"}
