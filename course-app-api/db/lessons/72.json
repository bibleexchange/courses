The Law is: an advantage to those who know it (vs. 1-2), absolute in its nature (vs. 3-8), unbending in its authority (vs. 9-19), has a distinct purpose (vs. 20-30), and is not made void, but rather is established\tby our faith. (v. 31).*\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n\r\nThe whole world is under the sentence of condemnation.\r\n\r\n## The charge is levied against the sinner. &mdash; v. 9\r\n\r\nWho is a sinner? We have proven both Jew and Gentile to be under sin as ALL are guilty of breaking the law.\r\n\r\n## Witnesses are brought before the accused.\r\n\r\n### The witness of creation &mdash; 1:20\r\n### The witness of conscience &mdash; 2:15\r\n### The witness of commandment &mdash; 3:19\r\n \r\n## The indictment is read from the Scriptures. &mdash; vs. 10-18\r\n\r\n### According to the rules of the court the indictment had to be written.\r\n\r\n> An indictment is a written accusation or formal charge of a crime or misdemeanor, preferred by a grand jury under oath to a court. - Webster\r\n\r\nThe Great Judge leaves no excuse for humanity and has Paul use the written Word to indict the accused.\r\n\r\n### Paul used their own sacred text to condemn the Jews.\r\n\t\r\nThe Jew boasted that he possessed the Scripture; now God is using that same Word to expose their sin. God is making them accountable to His Word.\r\n\r\n### Although the Gentile did not have the written word; they still had the same principals contained in the Word written on their heart \r\n\r\n## The defense of the accused &mdash; V. 19\r\n\r\nWhat is the defense of the accused?\r\n\r\nThe accused has nothing to say; every mouth is stopped.\r\nThe Day of Judgment will be a day of silence.\r\n\r\n## The verdict &mdash; V.20\r\n\r\n### GUILTY AS CHARGED!\r\n\r\n### No flesh is justified by deeds of law.\r\n\t\r\nThis law refers to more than Moses Law; there is also reference to moral law and the law of conscience. The Gentile did not posses Moses&apos;s Law, but every man has the moral law of God written on his heart and testified to by his conscience.\r\n\r\n### The death penalty has been levied against the condemned.
