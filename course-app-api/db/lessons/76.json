God will Fulfill His Promise &mdash; Romans 4:18-25\r\n\r\n### The Promise to Abraham, vs.18-22\r\n\r\nAbraham was given the promise of God. God promised Abraham he would have a son. Also, the Messiah would be a son of Abraham. Jesus fulfilled prophecy and was born according to his natural lineage as a descendant of Abraham. \r\n\r\n### The Promise of Justification, vs. 23,24\r\n\r\n> Romans 4:23 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 24 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, &hellip;\r\n\r\n### The Condition of Justification, vs. 24\r\n\r\n> Romans 4:24b-25 &hellip;if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; 25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.\r\n\r\nA person receives justification from God by faith -- \"if we believe&hellip;\".\r\n\r\nConditional Promises\r\n- Mark 9:23\r\n- John 5:47\r\n- John 8:24 \"believe not\"\r\n- John 10:38\r\n- John 11:40\r\n- John 12:47 (interesting)\r\n- Acts 8:37 (condition of salvation)\r\n- Romans 10:9\r\n- 1 Thessalonians 4:14\r\n- 2 Timothy 2:8-13 (God remaineth faithful)\r\n\r\n### The Courage of Faith & the the Divine Action of Justification\r\n\r\nAbraham believed the promise of God. Against hope believed in hope. Abraham believed in the promise of God regardless of the circumstances. Sarah was about 90 and Abraham was more than 100 years old. There was no natural way possible for them to have a child. Abraham staggered not at the promise of God.\r\n\r\n> Romans 4:20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;\r\n\r\nJustification is a Divine activity. Man cannot justify himself any more than Abraham could produce a son. Justification is a work of God bestowed by grace in response to faith. \r\n\r\n**IF WE BELIEVE ON HIM**\r\n\r\n> Romans 4:24&mdash;But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe following arguments are presented:\r\n\r\n### 1.\tJustification/Righteousness is by faith.\r\n### 2.\tJustification/Righteousness is not obtained by works.\r\n### 3.\tJustification/Righteousness is not acquired by circumcision.\r\n### 4.\tYou cannot gain Justification/Righteousness through adherence of the law. 4:13-17\r\n### 5.\tAbraham&apos;s faith shows us an example that we must follow.\r\n### 6.\tPaul reasoned that Justification/Righteousness by faith is the only way to please God.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nResearch \"Declared or Made Righteous\"\r\n\r\n- Is this historically a Roman Catholic position (\"made righteous\") ????\r\n\r\nBoth groups agree that the term invokes a communication of Christ's merits to sinners, not a declaration of sinlessness; Luther used the expression simul justus et peccator (\"at the same time justified and a sinner\"). However, Roman Catholicism sees justification as a communication of God's life to a human being, cleansing him of sin and transforming him truly into a son of God, so that it is not merely a declaration, but rather the soul is made actually objectively righteous. The Protestant view of justification, by contrast, is that it is the work of God through the means of grace. Faith is the righteousness of God that is accomplished in us through word and sacraments. Law and gospel work to kill the sinful self and to accomplish the new creation within us. This new creation within us is the faith of Christ. If we do not have this faith, then we are ungodly. Indulgences or human prayers add nothing&mdash;they are nothing. Everyone has some kind of faith &mdash; usually a faith in themselves. But we need God to continually destroy self-righteous faith and to replace it with the life of Christ. We need the faith that comes from God through law and gospel, word, works and sacraments. In the founding document of the Reformation, the 95 Theses, Luther said that 1.) \"When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, 'Repent&apos;s (Matthew 4:17) He willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.\" and 95.) And thus be confident of entering into heaven through many tribulations rather than through the false security of peace (Acts 14:22).\r\n\r\nThe true distinction, therefore, between the Protestant and the Catholic view of Justification is not an issue of being \"declared righteous\" versus being \"made righteous\", \r\n\r\n==================\r\n\r\nR.C. Sproul quote:\r\n\r\nRome set forth their doctrine -- and still does -- that God will never declare a person just until that person actually, under divine scrutiny, is found to be just&hellip;when God looks at us, he will not say that we are just until he sees that we really are just.\r\nRome teaches that we cannot be just without grace, that we will never become just without faith, and that we will never become just without the assistance of Christ. We need faith, we need grace, and we need Jesus. We need the righteousness of Christ infused or poured into our soul, but you must cooperate with that grace to such a degree that we will in fact become righteous. If we die with any impurity in our soul, thereby lacking complete righteousness, we will not go to heaven. If no mortal sin is present in our life, we will go to purgatory, which is the place of purging. The point of the purging is to get rid of the dross so that we become completely pure. It may take three years or three million years, but the object of purgatory is to make us righteous so that we can be admitted into God's heaven.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for this belief, that justification is rooted in an inherent righteousness in the sinner, comes from something unfortunate in church history. In the early centuries, when the Greek language passed away from the central attention of the church fathers and Latin became the dominant language, many scholars read only the Latin Bible, not the Greek bible, and they borrowed the Roman or Latin word for justification, iustificare, from which we get the English work justification. The Latin verb ficare means \"to make\" or \"to shape\" or \"to do.\" Isutus means \"righteousness\" or \"justice,\" so iustificare literally means \"to make righteous,\" which we believe is what happens in sanctification, not in justification.\r\n\r\nThe Greek word that we are dealing with here in the Romans text is the word dikaioo, dikaiosune, which does not mean \"to make righteous\" but rather \"to declare righteous.\" In the Roman Catholic view, God will never pronounce a person just or righteous until, by the help of God's grace and Christ, that person actually becomes righteous. [But] If God were to judge us tonight, what would he find? Would he find sin in our lives? Could he possibly declare us just if he considers only the righteousness that he finds in us today? Remember what the Apostle Paul said: \"By the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight\" (3:20). That is precisely why the ground for our justification cannot be found in us or in any righteousness inherent in our souls. That is why we need so desperately what Luther called a iustia alienum, an alien righteousness, a righteousness that comes from outside ourselves. Luther called this righteousness extranos, outside or apart from us.\r\n\r\nIn simple terms, this means that the only righteousness sufficient for us to stand before the judgment of God is the righteousness of Christ.\r\n\r\nExcerpt from Romans (St. Andrew's Expositional Commentary) by R.C.
