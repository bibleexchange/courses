The First Decree of the King vs. 1-7</h3>\r\n<h2>&quot;Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold.&quot; Why did he do this?</h2>\r\n<h4>1. The Image he saw - himself -</h4>\r\n<p>Strange shape 90 - 100 ft. high 9 - 10 ft. wide. 20 to 23 years elapsed between chapter two and three.</p>\r\n<p>The strange thing about the chapter  is there is no mention of Daniel. Daniel is away - on kings business- etc. The image may not have been made had Daniel been there. Daniel exercised a restraint upon the King as Christians should on the world and do. (II Thessalonians 2:7)</p>\r\n<h4>2.The downfall of his kingdom had been fore told - vs. 39 of chapter 2.</h4>\r\n<h5>a.Do you suppose he feared this and tried to strengthen his kingdom?</h5>\r\n<h5>b.Or was he lifted up in pride because his kingdom seemed so secure?</h5>\r\n<h5>c.Do you think he thought he was especially favored with God and so this magnified his place? Nebuchadnezzar had come to admire God and the wisdom given to Daniel but he was not brought to repentance. Is this true of today? Many who admire God and the Gospel and the Church never put trust in Christ as Savior . </h5>\r\n<p>In this image is set forth the power and the glory of man.</p>\r\n<p>The image bears the number of man- 60 by 6 cubits - The number of man. Six instruments of music vs. 5</p>\r\n<p>Whenever you see man exalting himself in his pride - it is always &quot;sixes.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The Anti-Christ Rev. 13:18; Goliath - I Sam. 17:4-7 - II Sam. 21:20</p>\r\n<p>The Image was made of Gold- Some believe wood overlaid with gold. Outwardly imperishable inwardly inferior.</p>\r\n<p>In the Plain of Dura ßAll by itself .</p>\r\n<p>The Day of dedication - Those that attended -When the band played everyone was to worship.</p>\r\n<h4>3.The Defiance of the Decree. Vs. 8-18</h4>\r\n<p>This is a great story. It would be three out of about 300000. Can we stand alone? Why didn&apos;t these bow down? The second commandment - Ex 20:4-5. If they bowed down they would be deliberately disobeying the command of their God. The Christian is to obey the law of the land until they have to do something contrary to the Word of God.</p>\r\n<p>The king gives them another chance. They might have misunderstood the command so suggests the king. Vs. 14. &quot;Is it of set purpose or is it a mistake on your part? Vs. 16. &quot;Not necessary to give you an answer.&quot; </p>\r\n<p>Vs. 17a The Principal of Faith - Knowledge</p>\r\n<p>Vs. 17b The Persistence of Faith - Courage</p>\r\n<p>Vs. 18 The Pledge of Faith - Dedication</p>\r\n<p>Job said &quot;Though He slay me yet I will trust Him.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The King loses his temper. The old saying is - &quot;When a man gets full of fury he gets full of folly.&quot; The furnace heated 7x&apos;s hotter. The king lost some of his best men.</p>\r\n<h4>4.The Deliverance over the Decree. Vs. 19-27</h4>\r\n<p>(1) Their Faith - Revealed- they defied the decree.</p>\r\n<p>(2) Their Faith Tried - They all fell down bound in the furnace. </p>\r\n<p>What was it that brought deliverance? -It wasn&apos;t the fire. - It wasn&apos;t themselves.- It wasn&apos;t any human being. àIt was Jesus!</p>\r\n<p>(3) Their Faith Honored - </p>\r\n<p>&quot;Then Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth of the mist of the fire.&quot; vs. 26 &quot;Upon whose bodies the fire had no power.&quot; vs.27</p>\r\n<h3>B. The Second Decree of the King. Vs. 28-30</h3>\r\n<h4>1.The King&apos;s Confession v. 28</h4>\r\n<h5>a.Recognition of God -</h5>\r\n<p>&quot;Blessed be the God&hellip;who hath sent His angel and delivered His servants.&quot;</p>\r\n<h5>b. Recognition of Faith.</h5>\r\n<p>&quot;That trusted in Him&quot;</p>\r\n<h5>c.Recognition of real Religion</h5>\r\n<p>&quot;Yielded their bodies&quot; Not just their heart mind or Their Spirit. Rom. 12:1</p>\r\n<h4>2.The King&apos;s Command - vs. 29</h4>\r\n<h5>a.Concerns all people.</h5>\r\n<h5>b. Concerns speech.</h5>\r\n<h5>c.Concerns severe punishment.</h5>\r\n<h4>3.The King&apos;s Conduct - vs. 30</h4>\r\n<h5>a.There is no repentance-</h5>\r\n<h5>b. He admires God.</h5>\r\n<h5>c.He promotes the Three.</h5>\r\n<h2>II. A Parable of the Present</h2>\r\n<p>What does this teach?</p>\r\n<h3>A. The doctrine of the totalitarian state. Vs.4 &quot;The State is all&quot;</h3>\r\n<h4>1. Its needs are paramount</h4>\r\n<h4>2.It's demands imperative</h4>\r\n<h4>3.It's commands absolute (The individual is part of the state.)</h4>\r\n<h3>B. The state is to be worshiped. </h3>\r\n<p>They must bring religion into it. Man is a religious being - incorporate religion into the state - make it subordinate.</p>\r\n<p>They command worship -&quot;to you it is commanded.&quot;</p>\r\n<h4>1. Found true in Germany -</h4>\r\n<p>Taken from &quot;The Times&quot; of 29th July 1936.&quot; &quot;One cannot be a good German and at the same time deny God but an avowal of faith in the eternal Germany is at the same time an avowal of faith in the eternal God. If we act as true Germans we act according to the laws of God. Whosoever serves Adolf Hitler the Fuhrer serves Germany and whosoever serves Germany serves God.&quot;</p>\r\n<h4>2.Also true of Communism -</h4>\r\n<p>Communism at the beginning set out to smash God. They would stamp out religion altogether. But they learned by their mistakesand now instead of trying to destroy they are trying to use it. Makeit subservient to the State. Communists allow religion but keep it under their control.</p>\r\n<h4>3.The Roman Catholic Church</h4>\r\n<p>Simply totalitarian tyranny. ARE WE REALLY FREE?</p>\r\n<h2>III.Prophecy of the Future</h2>\r\n<h3>A. The prophecy concerns the Anti-Christ -Rev. 13</h3>\r\n<h3>B. Mussolini started to make an image but he was hung by the heels and shot.</h3>\r\n<h3>C. Anti-christ &mdash;Abomination</h3>\r\n<h3>Dan. 3:28; Rom. 12.</h3>\r\n<h4>1.His nature -Peaceful beastly</h4>\r\n<h4>2.His image -Speak and kill</h4>\r\n<h4>3.His mark- Mark name number</h4>","title":"chapter-3-unbending-and-unburned.html","course_id":"prophecy-and-daniel"}
