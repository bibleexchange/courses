(Exodus 38:8)\r\n\r\n> Exodus 38:8 &mdash; And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\r\n\r\nThe mirror in Scripture is a symbol of the written Word of God (James 1:23,24). How significant that the mirrors of the women (which were used for the gratification of the flesh but cheerfully surrendered) should now be converted to opposite uses and used to minister to priests and stand through the ages as a type of the Word of God. So the most insignificant thing when dedicated to God can be  used for His glory and to bless others.\r\n\r\n## Function\r\n\r\nThe laver was filled with water with which the priests washed their hands and feet before attending to the ministry of the Tabernacle. Preparation for the worship, intercession and service, through daily cleansing is the prominent teaching of the laver.\r\n\r\n### Washing of Hands\r\n\r\nThe Hands represent the deeds. They must be holy (Psalm 24:3; 1 Corinthians 10:31).\r\n\r\n### Washing of Feet\r\n\r\nThe Feet represent the walk. It must be holy (Ephesians 4:17; Psalm 119:9; John 13:5).\r\n\r\n## Spiritual Cleansing\r\n\r\n### Washing of the Blood\r\n\r\n>Hebrews 9:22\r\n\r\n### Washing of the Word\r\n\r\nTitus 3:5 could be literally translated \"by the laver of regeneration\".\r\n\r\nEphesians 5:25-27; John 17:17; John 15:3.\r\n\r\n> John 15:3\r\n\r\nThe Word of God:\r\n1. Discovers Uncleanness\r\n2. Points Out the Remedy\r\n3. Gives Direction to Faith in the Excercises of Cleaning\r\n4. Assures Faith when the remedy is applied.\r\n\r\n## Two-Fold Cleansing\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus hung on Calvary, His precious side was pierced adn there came forth blood and water (John 19:14). \r\n\r\n- Jesus' heart was literally broken.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe gushing forth of a “fountain of blood” to wash our sins away (Revelation 1:5) is a natural metaphor drawn from this scene, but it is not clear how both blood and water could flow from such a wound. Some have suggested Jesus literally died of a broken heart, with the collapse of the ruptured heart cavity resulting in separation of the watery serum from the clotted blood in the pericardium. On the other hand, Jesus’ death was supernatural; He did not die naturally like others, but volitionally “gave up the ghost” (John 19:30; see note on Luke 23:46), so there may not be a natural explanation for this phenomenon. He had promised to provide “living water” to those who would “come unto me and drink” (John 4:10; 7:37), and the water flowing from His side would at least be symbolic of the “water of life” that would be eternally “proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb” (Revelation 22:1). The blood and water flowing from His opened side thus would represent both the cleansing blood of the slain Lamb and the life-sustaining water from the smitten Rock (Exodus 17:6; I Corinthians 10:4); it might even speak of the opened side of the first Adam, from which God made his bride (Genesis 2:21-24). See also John’s application of the water and the blood in I John 5:6-8.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHere we have represeented the double cleansing. From God's Living Word, Jesus, flowed, when Redemption's work was completed, both blood and water. The Blood flowed for the cleansing of our sin and water speaks to us of the WORD and the SPIRIT. These two cannot be separated. The Spirit acts through the word.\r\n\r\nThere is a washing of water by the Word which is called the \"washing of regeneration\" (Titus 3:5).\r\n\r\n> Titus 3:5 &mdash; Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;\r\n\r\nWater as associated with the Holy Ghost sets forth the washing of the Word Through the Spirit. The Word and the Spirit Agree. The Spirit inspired the Book. It takes the Spirit to make the Book \"alive\".\r\n\r\n> 1 Thessalonians 1:5 &mdash; For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. \r\n\r\n> John 7:37-38\r\n\r\nThe Spirit has come to make His Word alive in us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"laver-of-water.md","course_id":"tabernacle"}
