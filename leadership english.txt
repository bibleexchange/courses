# THE LEADER’S DAILY DOZEN

1. PLACE A HIGH VALUE ON PEOPLE

Most leaders focus on two things: the vision and the bottom line. The vision is what usually excites us most, and taking care of the bottom line keeps us in business. But between the vision and the bottom line are all the people in your organization. 

We cannot have a church without other people.

Give respect and thanks to your helpers.

2. COMMIT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP PEOPLE

Many people do not do anything because they don't know what to do.

Give them the information that they need to work.

3. PLACE A HIGH VALUE ON LEADERSHIP

4. LOOK FOR POTENTIAL LEADERS

Not everyone is a leader. Look among the people of your congregation for leadership qualities.

5. KNOW AND RESPECT YOUR PEOPLE

Form good relationships with your workers.

Do things with them outside of work. Invite them to your home for a meal.

6. PROVIDE YOUR PEOPLE WITH LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCES

One of the places where many leaders miss developmental opportunities comes in what we delegate. Our natural tendency is to give others tasks to perform rather than leadership functions to fulfill. We need to make a shift. If we don’t delegate leadership— with authority as well as accountability—our people will never gain the experience they need to lead well.

If you have children, you will one day have to let them leave home and start their own lives. You cannot always tell them what to do. The same is true with leadership. If you give someone responsibility, then you have to let them make decisions. Some of their decisions will not be what you would have done, but you need to let them make their own mistakes.

7. REWARD LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE

Many people do not try to do new things because they are afraid that they will be corrected.

If someone tries something new, encourage them and thank them for having vision.

8. PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS, SHARE IDEAS, AND TAKE RISKS

You should have good communication with your workers.

Don't make people feel stupid when they ask a question. 

Be willing to listen to their ideas.

9. GROW WITH YOUR PEOPLE

10. DRAW PEOPLE WITH HIGH POTENTIAL INTO YOUR INNER CIRCLE

Of the 12 disciples, Jesus chose Peter, James, and John to be special leaders.

We need to find people with ability and put them in a place to lead.

They need to be people you can trust. You will tell these people more information than you tell others.

11. COMMIT YOURSELF TO DEVELOPING A LEADERSHIP TEAM

12. UNLEASH YOUR LEADERS TO LEAD
