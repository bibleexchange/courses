Jonah Chapter 1, Part 2

Jonah 1:17 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

Mt 16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

# God Centered Ministry (The Shortest Path to Obscurity)

## Introduction: Meaning, worth

Do something and be somebody that counts. Self promotion. Usefulness to God and true worth begins with a death to the self life.

First, the prophecy deals with Jonah himself. Jonah Ran from God.

**Jer 23:24** Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD.

**Pr 18:10** ¶ The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.

1:3 Why did Jonah run?

	1. God's will didn't make sense to him
	2. What was going through Jonah's mind?

Vs. 3 He paid the fare thereof...
And it was a farther journey ...5x's...
Tarshish stood more than 2,500 miles from Israel in the opposite direction of Nineveh.( which was 500 miles east of home) . He tried to get as far away as j he could ... Does it really matter how FAR you run?

Nineveh: -was a great city (Lu 24:13) located on the east bank of the Tigris River about 550 miles from the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Founded by Nimrod

Jonah explains later WHY he ran...
Jonah 4:2 And he prayed to the Lord and said, “OLord, is not this what I said when I was yet in my country? That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to ...

in his heart Jonah knew that God’s intention was to show mercy. Jonah discovered that God’s salvation is available to all who repent, not just to the people of Jonah’s choosing.


## Not a Very Good Prophet

Based soley on our reading of Jonah 4 brief chapters, we probably conclude that Jonah was not a very good prophet.

-------------
	1. Ran from the Presence of God
	2. Disobeyed God
	3. Preached Begrudgingly
	4. Preaching Without Mercy
	5. Disappointed at the Mercy of God

<Many jews even called him a FALSE prophet because Nineveh was destroyed in 40 days like he said

4:1--But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

Jews called him the FALSE prophet ... because the destruction of Nineveh didn't happen :) (God showed mercy to their repentance)

Could this have been part of his motivation?

---------------------------

## A Strong Start 

Jonah’s immediate predecessors were Elijah and Elisha; Jonah, Amos and Hosea were contemporary prophets; Isaiah immediately followed them. Prophesied in Israel sometime before the reign of Jeroboam II. (58 years after Jehu's first year)

[858] that the repentance of the Ninevites happened in the twenty-third year of the reign of Jehu, king of Israel 
(FIRST YEAR of Jehu as king: 2 Kings 9:1 Elisha sends a disciple to anoint Jehu king (removing Ahab and Jezebel); The Jews say that this was JONAH the prophet. 

2 Kings 9:4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.
ACC: This should be translated, The servant of the prophet; that is, the servant which Elisha now had in place of Gehazi. --- Prophesied and Ran --- What did this *mad man say*? "JEHU IS KING"). 
          
AFTER NINEVEH: 2Ki 14:25 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.

Jonah's date is determined by this passage. He was contemporary with Hosea and Amos, and earlier than Micah.
Gittah-hepher. Or, Gathhepher (1 Kings 14:25) was the birth place of the prophet Jonah. Now el-Mesh-hed, where the tomb of Jonah is still shown. in Zebulon which is in Southern Galilee. The prophet Jonah was a Galilean from Gath-hepher.  Out of Galilee ! (compare John 7:52

## Yet the Ninevites Repented

from Charles Spurgeon, "My Sermon Notes, Vol. 2" p. 333
Jonah 3:4 ...Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
Matthew 12:41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment...

"The Ninevites' Repentance"

The men of Nineveh repented but...

**I. Their Calls to Repentance Were Not Many**
     Ninevah heard only one prophet and he was neither the greatest nor most affectionate.
**II. The Message of the Prophet was Not Encouraging**
     His message began and ended with threating with no mention of the possibility of pardon.
**III. The Prophet Himself Was No Helper of their Hope**
     Jonah was no loving tender pastor anxious to gather the lost sheep. He disliked the ministry in which he was engaged.
**IV. The Hope to which the Ninevites Could Reach was Slender**
     "Who can tell?" Have we not all at least this hope? Will we act on it?

[He saw a cannon shot off and at the warning of the fire lighting the ordance the soldiers fell to the ground escaping the bullet. ] "God, in like manner, warns before He wounds; frights before He fights. 'Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown." Oh, Let us fall down before the Lord our maker. Then shall His anger be pleased to make in us a daily passover, and his bullets leveled at us must fly above us. --Thomas Fuller, 

[710 BC] Nineveh relapsed, and about one hundred and fifty years afterwards, the Prophet Nahum was sent to predict the miraculous discomfiture of the Assyrian king under Sennacherib, an event which took place about 710 B.C., and also the 

[612 BC] total destruction of Nineveh by Medes and Persians and rebelling Babylonians.
