/* In part 2, I added a player character to the screen. I created world
boundaries with collision detection, and I added keyboard input to move the
player around. His color changes whenever he jumps. */

/* Changes since the last part: I moved the event handlers out of the component
files. Any functionality that might need two or more components to communicate
should be in the main file. The resize function, for example, shouldn't be in
Display, because it needs information from Game to size the onscreen canvas.
As a general rule, anything that causes two components to communicate should be
in the main file because we want to reduce internal references between components
as much as possible. They should communicate via public methods that take primitives. */

  The reason being that later on in development I might need to do something with
