# Jonah

## Introduction

### A Prophetic Account (Matt. 12:38-41; 16:4; Luke 11:29-32)
God seeks to purify the heart of His messenger that He may purify the heart of His people. It was not written for Nineveh, but for Israel. 
Judgment was preached by one prophet and grace reached Nineveh’s heart.
Grace was given to Israel by many prophets that they refused and therefore were judged.
Nineveh shall rise in judgment and condemn every generation that rejects Christ. Matt. 12:41

### A Missionary Purpose
God’s elect will fulfill His mission.	Isaiah 42:1-4; 49:1-13; 11:10
Divine call	(1:1-2); Divine pity (4:11); Divine patience (4:2; 3:10); Divine power (4:6-11; 1:4,17; 2:10)

## Chapter 1: A Fantastic Account
The account of Jonah might seem so fantastic, we might fail to relate it and miss the many great lessons found in it. Jonah, in print, appears as an amazing combination of extremes. God calls him and he runs. God sends a tremendous storm to get his attention and goes and takes a nap. His name means “a dove” which is a symbol of gentleness and purity and yet he demonstrates a very volatile nature.
Do I know anyone this intense? On more careful examination, I believe everyone of us can relate and learn from Jonah’s testimony.The contrasts of this account makes our understanding it so much simpler.
Above all, God is merciful.			2:8
This book serves as a picture of end-time deliverance for all that will serve God.

## God Speaks So Plainly To Jonah
v.1-2
Jonah’s revelation of the Word

### Jonah Runs From God

vs. 3

JONAH’S DISOBEDIENCE. In disobeying God, Jonah not only went out from Joppa but from the presence of God. Things seemed fine, but favorable circumstances are not necessarily a sign that we are in the will of God. Jonah did not get by freely, but certainly “paid the fare thereof.”


### God Sends a Storm and Jonah Takes a Nap

vs. 4-5

GOD CHASTISES JONAH. Jonah’s revelation of God’s divine providence. The Lord sent a mighty tempest that put the ship in jeopardy. The Lord caused the lot to fall upon Jonah exposing him as the cause of the evil. The sea ceased from raging after Jonah was cast out of the ship. God prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. Jonah was preserved for 3 days and nights in the belly of the great fish.

Jonah asleep is a picture of the church as a whole. Fatigued and worn out with mental anxiety and emotional strain and unaware of the dangers around them. 1:5-6
### Jonah the Man of God Gets Rebuked by aTthe Heathen

vs. 6

### Jonah Does His Best to Hide and his Sin is Still Discovered

vs. 7-10 
analogy of “i wouldn’t get caught’

### Jonah Confesses and Things Get Worse
vs. 11-17
A confession of faith without works of repentance.Sin so hardens the heart that it would rather die than repent. Sin is so selfish when it is allowed on board it destroys all. At anytime that Jonah would repent, God would calm the storm. He did it for the mariners  (1:15,16). He did it for the Ninevites (3:10).








Jonah was willing to receive mercy for His people and himself, but not willing to give mercy to strangers (II Kings 14:25; Jonah 4:2). 
Jonah was a native of Gath-hepher in Zebulon and the son of Amittai of Galillee. (John 7:52 - Jonah, Nahum. Not far from Nazareth where Jesus grew up.) 
Jonah in the great fish was a type of Christ’s death and resurrection. Jonah loved truth, but truth must have full course in your life. We must experience the Revelation so we can be like the Lord all ways without delay.

Jonah’s Displeasure							      4:1-11

	1.	Jonah’s attitude towards the revelation of God’s nature was for that the 
	Awful sinner didn’t deserve to repent of his wickedness.	4:1-3
	2.	Compare 4:5 with 3:3.
	3.	Here we see Jonah prone to self-pity.				      4:3
	4.	Unreasonable							      4:4
	5.	More desiring of his own vindication that the sparing of Nineveh. 4:5
	6.	Jonah had more pity for himself than  the 120,000 that knew not the truth.
					     				      4:6-10

The Lord Has the Last Word						      4:11
	“Should not I spare - that Great City” What about your city?		
Jonah 1:1 “NOW”
Have God’s compassion, fill your heart.m
Judgment is sure to come if there is not true repentance.
