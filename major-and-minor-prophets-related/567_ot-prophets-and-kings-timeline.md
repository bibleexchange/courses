# O.T. Prophets and Kings Time-line

Because the Old Testament spans a time-frame of thousands of years, it is very difficult to keep &quot;who lived during what time&quot; straight in our mind. Let's tackle the prophets of the books from Isaiah to Malachi for this study. We will introduce these prophets in the order of the time of their ministries and not the order of their respective books in the Old Testament.

We will list the old Testament Prophets and relate each prophet to the king and other prophets that are relevant to his lifetime. The ministries of the Biblical prophets we are including in this study spanned from Obadiah in 853 BC until Malachi in 430 BC &mdash;16 prophets and a period of over 400 years. 

NOTE: As is our only option with most Biblical events, all dates given are approximate unless noted otherwise.
