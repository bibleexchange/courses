## Principle eleven: We must be taught by the Holy Spirit

He is the master teacher (I Cor. 2:13â€“14). Be careful of the words which men's wisdom teacheth. Commentaries can be helpful especially to learn about culture and history, but they are no substitute for the teaching of the Holy Ghost.

The Holy Ghost will teach you (John 14:26; 16:13). This is a promise of God. Pray for understanding of the Word you are studying. God is faithful to reveal His Word to you.

Meditate on the Word of God (Joshua 1:8).
