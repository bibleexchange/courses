## Principle eleven: Ask Questions of the text

The questions to ask:

1. **Who:** What people are mentioned in the text? It may be a single person or it may be a group of people, such as "the gentiles" or "the Pharisees." It may also be a spiritual being, such as "God" or "an angel." When you locate the name of a person, see what the text has to say about them. After that, you can use a concordance or the reference notes in your Bible to find other places in the Bible that can tell you more about that person.
2. **When:** It can be a concrete time, such as "the first day of the week," or a general time period, such as "in times past." Is the author talking about things that already happened or things that they hope or prophesy will happen?
3. **Where:** May be a physical place or a spiritual realm, such as "heaven."
4. **What:** You need to try to find the big ideas of the text. Look for words or phrases that are repeated. These will signify things that are important.
5. **Why:** After we have learned all the details of the text, we can try to understand the reason it was written.
