## Principle five: context is the greatest key to interpretation

This fifth principle is pretty much "all encompassing." Context is how a word or sentence fits in relation to the whole sentence or passage. Context takes in all the individual parts of the whole. The best way to understand the meaning of a word is to see how that word is used in the sentence. The context of Scripture involves the placement of a verse within its particular chapter and book. Each verse of Scripture is profoundly important, but its importance can only be understood by considering its role in the paragraph, chapter, book, or even the Bible as a whole. A complete understanding of the book the text is taken from is best.

### One verse cannot be understood by itself

We cannot properly study a small portion of anything without carefully considering the whole and the sum of its parts. Imagine how incomplete your understanding of airplanes would be if you were not educated in the natural laws. The flight of an airplane would forever be a mystery until you studied the airplane in the "context" of its natural environment of wind, gravity, air pressure, etc.

EXAMPLE: We know Hebrews 13:5 says Christ promised us, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." So, What did Jesus mean "I go away" in John 14:28? If all we do is consider verse 28 and ignore its context, we will forced to conclude there is a contradiction found here. But, if we carefully include its context in our study, we will discover a clear and simple meaning. The manner in which Christ was with them (physically present) was going to change (present spiritually).

The best way to understand the meaning of a word is to see how that word is used in the context of the sentence.

### Do not remove a verse from the verses around it

A text taken out of context is pretext. A "pretext" is used to disguise the real motive and intention. Using Scripture as a pretext is using Scripture to say what you want it to say and not what God has to say. A text taken out of context is an abuse of Scripture.

### Not all words in the Bible are direct from the mouth of God

The Bible contains an inspired account of events that occurred and statements that were made. For example the Book of Job records the conversations between Job and his friends. The conversation is recorded accurately as it took place, but the council of Job's comforters is not good council and should not be regarded as such.

The temptation of Jesus found in Matthew 4:1–11 records the devil quoting Scripture to Jesus in verse 6. The devil twisted the meaning of Psalm 91:11–12 to tempt Jesus to jump off of the temple. Jesus refuted the devil's misuse of theScripture by responding with another Scripture: Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God (Deut. 6:16).
