## Principle four: read from the author's point of view

All Scripture must be taken from the author's point of view (2 Tim. 3:16). Consider details like, who was the author's target audience? Who wrote it? Paul, Peter, John the Beloved, Moses, or Mark? All of these people had different writing styles and different purposes for writing. The context of Scripture involves the personalities and characteristics of the authors. We would judge a record written by an eye witness different from a record written by someone with second-hand information.

### Consider the historical setting of a passage to insure correct interpretation

The context of Scripture involves the historical details influential at the time a passage was written. Paul wrote Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon from prison! Also, Paul was born in Tarsus the capital of Cilicia and home to one of only three great universities of the ancient world Athens andAlexandria are the other two. Paul was trained in Jerusalem under Gamaliel the great teacher of Jewish Law. Paul received the best education possible in his day. He was no uneducated fool.

For example Daniel 5 opens with a feast of revelry and drinking. The city of Babylon had been under siege by the Medo-Persians for two years prior to the opening feast of this chapter. This tells us something of the pride and arrogance of the Babylonians who thought they were indestructible. The only way to know about such historical considerations is to study research materials such as commentaries. A word of caution not all books are historically accurate. Special caution should be used for example when reading any material produced by the Roman Catholic church since they often alter the accounts to their advantage.

### Consider archaeological factors to help you understand the meaning of a passage

Again in Daniel 5, the walls of the city of Babylon were so thick that chariot races were held on top of the walls. The people thought there fortress was impenetrable. Archeology is in full support of the Bible. This is why study and education are so important to be able to understand these archaeological facts in order to better understand the setting of the Biblical accounts.

### Consider geographical factors that would contribute to the understanding of the passage.

We will stay in Daniel 5 to show you how all these considerations are taken together to glean the full meaning of the passage. The Euphrates River ran into the city of Babylon. They had a freshwater supply and grew their own food; this added to their feeling of unconcern of the siege for they thought they could hold out forever. The entrance of the River was protected buy two large iron gates. This information is helpful to understand the prophecy of Isaiah regarding Babylon (Isaiah 45:1). History tells us that on the night of the feast the guards got drunk and left the iron gates open. The prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled when Cyrus the Persian and Darius the Median took the kingdom of Babylon that night of the feast.

### Consider cultural practices of the time setting of the passage

Paul admonished the woman to keep silent in the church (I Cor. 14:3). A cultural practice of the day was for the woman to sit on one side and the men on the other. The unlearned women were disrupting the service by asking questions across the aisle. A continuation of the context of the verse tells the woman to ask their husbands at home. Or, to put it simply, Paul was telling the wives to wait until they got home to ask their husbands a question and not to disrupt the service. Paul is in no way saying that woman have no place and should not be allowed to testify and participate in the church service.

### What is the genre of the passage?

Meaning is Genre Dependent. The consideration of the many different Biblical genre text is so important to meaning. Epistles, Gospel, Apocalyptic, Prophetic, Parabolic, Poetic, Historical cannot all be treated in an identical manner because each is governed by a different purpose.
