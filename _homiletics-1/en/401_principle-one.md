## Principle one: interpretation must be consistent and objective

A valid and honest method of interpretation must be consistent and without contradiction. We must never be governed by a theological predisposition. If our interpretation (hermeneutics) is controlled by our theology, then the Bible can be made to say whatever our theology says.

We must always use the right principles of interpretation in order to properly understand the truth. The Bible contains various types of literature, such as parables, poetry, proverbs, allegories, prayers, decrees of Kings, and letters. We would not interpret a poem as we would a decree. For example, in Daniel 3:29, Nebuchadnezzar made a decree to cut in pieces anyone who spoke against the true God. A preacher could be grossly wrong if he followed a literal interpretation today of this decree.
