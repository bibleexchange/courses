for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">14 &nbsp;And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">15 &nbsp;And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">16 &nbsp;There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">17 &nbsp;And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">18 &nbsp;And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">19 &nbsp;And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">20 &nbsp;And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">21 &nbsp;And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">22 &nbsp;What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">23 &nbsp;Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">24 &nbsp;Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">25 &nbsp;As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">26 &nbsp;Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">27 &nbsp;And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">28 &nbsp;Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">29 &nbsp;(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">30 &nbsp;And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">31 &nbsp;And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">32 &nbsp;Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">33 &nbsp;Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">34 &nbsp;And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">35 &nbsp;And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">36 &nbsp;For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">37 &nbsp;And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">38 &nbsp;Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">39 &nbsp;But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">40 &nbsp;And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">22:1 &nbsp;Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">2 &nbsp;(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">3 &nbsp;I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">4 &nbsp;And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">5 &nbsp;As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">6 &nbsp;And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">7 &nbsp;And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">8 &nbsp;And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">9 &nbsp;And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">10 &nbsp;And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">11 &nbsp;And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">12 &nbsp;And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">13 &nbsp;Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">14 &nbsp;And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">15 &nbsp;For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">16 &nbsp;And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">17 &nbsp;And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">18 &nbsp;And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">19 &nbsp;And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">20 &nbsp;And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">21 &nbsp;And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">22 &nbsp;And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">23 &nbsp;And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">24 &nbsp;The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">25 &nbsp;And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">26 &nbsp;When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">27 &nbsp;Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">28 &nbsp;And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">29 &nbsp;Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">30 &nbsp;On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">23:1 &nbsp;And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">2 &nbsp;And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csA7555675">3 &nbsp;Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</span></p></body>
