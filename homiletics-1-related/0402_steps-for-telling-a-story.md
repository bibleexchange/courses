# Steps for Telling a Story

## Choose the story

Stories are everywhere. You hear them on the radio, read them in books, and hear them in conversations. You even can get stories from events that happen in your own life. For the exercises in this class, you will choose a story from the Bible, but these same steps can be used for any other story. When looking for a story in the Bible, don't just use the familiar ones like David and Goliath or Noah's Ark. There are many stories in the Bible that people in the church may have never heard. Here are some suggestions for Bible stories, but there are many besides them:

* Adam and Eve
* Cain and Abel
* The flood
* The call of Abraham
* Lot escapes Sodom and Gomorrah
* Jacob and Esau
* Joseph and his brothers
* The golden calf
* Jethro helps Moses
* Korah
* Baalam and the donkey
* Joshua and Jericho
* Ehud the judge
* Deborah and Barak
* Gideon
* Jephthah&apos;s Vow
* Samson
* The life of King Saul
* How David met Abigail
* Solomon's wisdom
* Ruth
* Josiah the boy king
* Elijah and the prophets of Baal
* Naaman the leper
* Rebuilding the Temple
* Esther
* Jonah and the whale
* The birth of Jesus
* John the Baptist
* The temptations of Jesus
* Feeding the five thousand
* The woman at the well
* The good samaritan
* The man that built his house on the rock
* the prodigal son
* The rich man and Lazarus
* The Transfiguration
* Lazarus lives again
* Judas betrays Jesus

* The death of Stephen
* Peter and John heal the lame man
* Ananias and Sapphira
* The conversion of Paul
* The ministry of Philip
* Peter and Cornelius
* Paul and Silas sing in jail

Make sure the story is good for the audience that you are talking to. Most stories in the Bible will work for all people, but some may not be best for children, such as the story of Judah and Tamar.
