<p>Foraging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_honey_bee" title="Western honey bee" >Western honey bees</a> perform a dance on their return to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beehive" title="Beehive" >hive</a>, known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance" title="Waggle dance" >waggle dance</a>, indicating that food is farther away, while the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_dance_(honey_bee)" title="Round dance (honey bee)" >round dance</a> is a short version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance" title="Waggle dance" >waggle dance</a>, indicating that food is nearby. The laden forager dances on the comb in a circular pattern, occasionally crossing the circle in a zig-zag or waggle pattern.</p>

<p>In 1947, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Frisch" title="Karl von Frisch" >Karl von Frisch</a> correlated the runs and turns of the dance to the distance and direction of the food source from the hive. </p>
<p>The orientation of the dance illustrates the relative position of the sun to the food source, </p>
<p>and the length of the waggle portion of the run is correlated to the distance from the hive. </p>

<p>Von Frisch performed a series of experiments to validate his theory. He was awarded the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine" title="Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine" >Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> in 1973 for his discoveries.</p>

<h4>ADDITIONAL NOTES for P.17:. Question: "Is all humanity God's children"</h4>
<p>Answer: The Bible is clear that all people are God&#8217;s creation (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Colossians 1.16" >Colossians 1:16</a>), and that God loves the entire world (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/John 3.16" >John 3:16</a>), but only those who are born again are children of God (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/John 1.12" >John 1:12</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/John 11.52" >11:52</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Romans 8.16" >Romans 8:16</a>; <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/1 John 3.1-10" >1 John 3:1-10</a>).</p>

<p>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (MORMONS)</p>
<p>The LDS church teaches a unique belief that answers this poignant question &#8212; are all children of a Heavenly Father who loves us. Our Father in Heaven created our spirits, and we lived with him in a premortal world. Our existence on this world was not an accident or improvisation. He created the Earth specifically for us. We chose to be sent here, to receive our physical bodies, and to be tested preparatory for us receiving all that God has planned for us according to our faithfulness. </p>
<p>While we are all the spirit offspring of God the Father, and therefore the spiritual brothers and sisters to Jesus Christ (who was chosen from before the foundation of the world to be our Savior), Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten, Flesh and Bone Son of God. Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer, who set the way for us to return to the presence of Our Father in Heaven. Only a family member would love us enough to offer himself as a sacrifice for justice and mercy.</p>

<p>Jewish Religious Humanist Joseph Haddad</p>
<p>Wrote a book Titled &#8220; Discover the Truth for Yourself &#8211; We Are All God&#8217;s Children.&#8221; He explores what it means for us all to be a part of a single family &#8211; God&#8217;s family. From the book:</p>
<p>The Bible&#8217;s purpose is to teach us about Man and God, and in so doing, to provide us with a moral and legislative code with which to guide our lives, in both a universal and particularistic way. The family of Man is enjoined to live their lives in a certain manner, while the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are called upon to conduct their lives according to a highly-structured format, serving as teachers and role models for their fellow human beings.</p>

<p>Here comes a Baptist, here comes a Jew, there goes a mormon, and a Muslim too, I see a Buddhist and a Hindu, I see a Catholic and I see You (CHORUS) We&#8217;re all God&#8217;s Children (3x&#8217;s) &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we be one big happy family?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roman Catholic Question and Answer Forum</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, my dear friend, who is a self proclaimed Sola Scriptura, Non-Denominational, evangelical Protestant asked me: "Do you think non-Christians are children of God?" Well, having gone to parochial school for nine years, I was taught that God is our Father and that we (mankind) are God's children&#8230;</p>
<p>Is my friend correct? Is there anything in Sacred Scripture that implies that all men are children of God? Does the Church teach we are all God's children? It's really hard discussing Christianity with Christians who believe that the Holy Bible is the sole and ultimate basis of teaching. Thank and God Bless. In His Most Sacred Heart. Denise</p>
