<h2>The Office of Angels</h2>

<h3>Ministering Spirits&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Heb.1:14</h3>

<h4>To God</h4>
<p>The main duty of angels is to worship and serve God. Angels worshipping and serving God are portrayed many times in the Bible and especially in the book of Revelation. Angels worship and carry out the commands of God.</p>

<p>Hebrews 1:6&#8212; &#8230; let all the angels of God worship him.</p>
<p>I Peter 3:22&#8212;&#8230; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p>
<p>Revelation 5:11&#8212;&#8230; many angels round about the throne&#8230;[10,000 x&#8217;s 10,000]</p>
<p>Dan 7:10;1Ki 22:19; IIKi 6:16-17; IIChr 32:7-8;Ps 68:17;103:20-21; He12:22; Re 5:11</p>
<p>Revelation 14:10&#8212;&#8230; he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</p>
<h4>To Man</h4>
<p>Angels have been given the task by God to minister to His people. </p>

<p>Hebrews 1:14&#8212;Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</p>

<h5>Protecting</h5>
<p>Psalm 34:7&#8212;The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</p>
<p>Exodus 14:19&#8212;And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:</p>
<p>Psalm 91:11,12&#8212;For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>

<h5>Revealing & Guiding</h5>
<p>The angel Gabriel instructed Daniel on the meaning of his dreams and visions. (Daniel 8:16; 9:21) Many times in the Bible, angels delivered messages from God to men. An angel told Zechariahs he would have a son named him John. (Luke 1:19) The greatest message ever carried was Gabriel&#8217;s message to Mary that she would conceive a son and call His name Jesus.</p>
<p>We are warned in Galatians 1:8 that if even an angel from Heaven were to preach any other Gospel, he is to be accursed. Even the message of angels is to be tested by the Word.</p>

<h5>Providing</h5>
<h5>God has used angels to provide physical needs such as <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/food.html" >food</a> for <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/hagar.html" >Hagar</a> (<a href="#17" >Genesis 21:17-20</a>), <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/elijah.html" >Elijah</a> (<a href="#6" >1 Kings 19:6</a>), and Christ after His <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/temptation.html" >temptation</a> (<a href="#11" >Matthew 4:11</a>). </h5>
<h5></h5>
<h5>Delivering</h5>
<p>Getting God's people out of danger. Angels released the <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/apostle.html" >apostles</a> from <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/prison.html" >prison</a> in <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/acts5.html" >Acts 5</a>, and again for <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/peter.html" >Peter</a> in <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/acts12.html" >Acts 12</a>:7-9. In Daniel 6:22, an angel shut the lions&#8217; mouth for Daniel.</p>

<h5>Strengthening and encouraging </h5>
<p>Angels strengthened <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/jesus.html" >Jesus</a> after His <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/temptation.html" >temptation</a> (<a href="#11" >Matt 4:11</a>), encouraged the <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/apostle.html" >apostles</a> to keep preaching after releasing them from prison (<a href="#19" >Acts 5:19-20</a>), and told <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/paul.html" >Paul</a> that everyone on his <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/ships.html" >ship</a> would survive the impending shipwreck (<a href="#23" >Acts 27:23-25</a>). </p>

<h5>Answering prayer</h5>
<p>God often uses angels as His means of answering the <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/prayer.html" >prayers</a> of His people (Daniel <a href="#20" >9:20-24</a>; <a href="#10" >10:10-12</a>; <a href="#1" >Acts 12:1-17</a>).</p>

<h5>Caring for believers at the moment of <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/death.html" >death</a></h5>
<p>In the story of <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/lazarus.html" >Lazarus</a> and the rich man, we read that angels carried the <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/spirit.html" >spirit</a> of Lazarus to &#8220;<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/abrahamsbosom.html" >Abraham's bosom</a>&#8221; when he died (<a href="#22" >Luke 16:22</a>).</p>

<h3>Not to be Worshipped</h3>

<p>Although God&#8217;s are holy creatures, they are not to be worshipped. Satan tried to get Jesus to worship him, but Jesus flatly told him only God is to be worshipped. Angels are meant to worship God and in no case are they to be worshipped.</p>

<p>Luke 4:8&#8212; &#8230;Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:6&#8212;&#8230;And let all the angels of God worship him [Jesus].</p>
<p>Colossians 2:18&#8212;Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</p>
<p>Romans 1:25&#8212;&#8230;worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator&#8230;</p>

<p>We are not to worship any created being, even angels. All worship is to be directed to the Creator. It is dangerous folly for many to put unhealthy emphasis on angels. Only three names are given in Scripture out of the innumerable number that makes up the Heavenly Host; this should be an indication to us not to give undue attention and focus to angels. Our focus should be on Christ and being led by the Holy Ghost.</p>
