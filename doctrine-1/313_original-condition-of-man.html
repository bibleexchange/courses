<h1>Anthropology: The Original Condition of Man</h1>

<h2>Man was created a perfect being.</h2>
<p>The record of Scripture plainly describes that man was not created a simple cell that evolved or any other such theory&#44; but was created perfectly complete and mature. There were no flaws in Godâ€™s design.</p>

<h2>Man was created a free moral agent.</h2>
<p>The sin in the garden was volitional on the part of man. It was completely voluntary for they had the <i>freedom of choice.</i></p>

<h2>Man was created with an inherent religious instinct&#44; which made him conscious of moral responsibility to God&#44; and capable of communion with God.</h2>

<h2>Original man was created sinless (Genesis 1:31) and innocent of evil. (Genesis 2:17; 3:5-7)</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:31:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>very</i> &mdash mead (Hebrew) superlative; exceeding; very</li>
<li><i>good</i> &mdash towb (Hebrew) good; best; beautiful</li>
</ul>

<h2>The original man was endued with lofty intellectual faculties. Genesis 2:19&#44; 20; Hebrews 2:6-9</h2>
<p>Man was created with enough intellectual capacity to give names to all living creatures&#44; and to have dominion over them. The modern theories of evolution&#44; which try to explain the development of man from a lower order of beings&#44; are monstrous products of unbridled imaginations.</p>
<p>Genesis 3:7 does not suggest that Adam and Eve were created intellectually ignorant. The fact they could be naked and not <i>know</i> it would seem to suggest a lack of intelligence. The answer to this puzzle is that they were created in <i>innocence</i> and not <i>ignorance</i>. It is hard for us to comprehend a world full of innocence and void of evil. But this is exactly the atmosphere of Eden that Adam and Eve enjoyed. There were no impure thoughts or motives&#44; no <i>sewer-thinking</i>&#44; or any such thing. Until the fall there was no precedent for <i>sin</i>. They enjoyed the glory and beauty of the purity of God in a pristine form&mdash;untouched by the filth of sin.</p>
