### Henry VIII's Act of Supremacy (1534)

In 1521 Henry attacked Luther's view of the sacraments, and so the pope gave him the title "Defender of the Faith." It is almost humorous that the pope gave him this title, because in just a short time after, Henry would completely move away from the organization that gave him that title.

After the death of his brother, Henry married his sister-in-law, Catherine of Argon. They had no son together, and so Henry wanted to annul his marriage and marry Anne Boleyn. He used Leviticus 20:21 to found his case for an annulment.

The pope would not grant him the annulment, and so Henry appointed Thomas Cramner archbishop of Canterbury. The new archbishop gave him the annulment that he was seeking. Henry declared that the king of England was the head of the church.

Henry alikuwa na binti wawili. Maria alikuwa Mkatoliki, na Elizabeth alikuwa Kiprotestanti.

### St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (1572)

Protestantism was growing in France despite opposition from the government. The Huguenots were led by admiral Coligny, and they wanted religious freedom. The French Catholics were led by the Guise family, who believed in the French tradition of "on king, on faith, one law." In the decade leading up to the massacre, France had three religious wars. Both groups used violence to try to get their way.

On August 18, 1572, the Protestant prince, Henri of Navarre, married the Catholic Margaret of Valois. The king hoped that the marriage would bring peace.

On August 22 someone tried and failed to assassinate the Huguenot leader, Coligny. The Huguenots were angered by this attack.

On August 23 the king decided that all the Huguenots should be killed, and on August 24 the massacre started before 4 in the morning.
