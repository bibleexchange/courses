# Bible Bowl Rules

Students compete over their knowledge of a particular section of Scripture in a 15-minute game. The most points at the end of the game wins!

The quizmaster reads questions (referred to as “toss-ups”) to the players.  The first player to buzz in and answer correctly gets a series of “bonus” questions for that player’s team to answer together.  This pattern of toss-up followed by bonus is repeated throughout the game.

A toss-up is comprised of a lead-in sentence to help the players anticipate the Bible verse from which the question will come, followed by the question itself.  This format of lead-in followed by question allows students to be challenged in a fun and unique way to recall the verses they have learned.
