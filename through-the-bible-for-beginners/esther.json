      "value": "# Book of Esther Introduction\n\n## Author\n\nThe Book of Esther does not specifically name its writer. The most popular tradition is that Mordecai (a major character in the Book of Esther) wrote the account.\n\n## Date\n\nThe Book of Esther was likely written between 460 and 350 B.C.\nTraditional view:  Between the 6th and 7th chapters of Ezra before Ezra left for Jerusalem.\n\n[!--timeline--!]\n\nSecondary View: Esther precedes the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.\n\n## Name\n\n- Esther – (a star) The Persian name of Hadassah.\n- Hadassah – (Myrtle) The Jewish name of Esther.  Esther 2:7\n- Myrtle – A plant mentioned in Nehemiah 8:15; Isa. 41:19; Zech. 1:8,10\n\nThe modern Jews still adorn with myrtle the booths and sheds at the Feast of Tabernacles.  Formerly, as we learn from Nehemiah 8:15, myrtle grew on the hills about Jerusalem.  \n\nThe Myrtus Communis is the king denoted by the Hebrew word.  It is a shrub or low tree, sometimes ten feet high, with green shining leaves and snow white flowers, bordered with purple, “which emits a perfume more exquisite than that of the rose.”  The seeds of the myrtle dried before they are ripe, form our allspice.  The plant is common in Palestine today.\n\n## Style\n\nA historical account. There are two principle theories concerning the historical nature of this book:  one, that it is a reliable history; the other, that it is a historical romance founded on fact, or substantially true, like Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar and Henry VIII.  The fact that the action of the book diminishes in the establishment of the popular national feast of Purim,  and that it is a standing memorial of that feast, argues for its general historicity.\nIt is much like the story of Joseph in Genesis 41:34-37, both stories involve foreign monarchs who control the destiny of the Jews. Both accounts show the heroism of Israelite individuals who provide the means for the salvation of their people and nation. The hand of God is evident, in that what appears to be a bad situation is indeed very much under the control of the Almighty God who ultimately has the good of the people at heart. \n\n## Key Verses\n\n>Esther 2:15—Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.\n\n> Esther 4:14—For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? {enlargement: Heb. respiration}\n\n> Esther 6:12—And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.\n\n> Esther 7:3—Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:\n\n## Theme\n\nThis book records God’s deliverance of His people from a threatened destruction.\n\nThe main characters in this epic narrative are Esther, Mordecai, King Ahasuerus and Haman.\n\nThe purpose of the Book of Esther is to display the providence of God, especially in regard to His chosen people, Israel. \nThe Book of Esther records the institution of the Feast of Purim and the obligation of its perpetual observation. The Book of Esther is read at the Feast of Purim to commemorate the great deliverance of the Jewish nation brought about by God through Esther. Jews today still read Esther during Purim.\n\n## Outline\n\nFeasting is a major theme of this book, there are ten recorded banquets, and many of the events were planned, plotted, or exposed at these banquets. The book of Esther could be divided in three parts:\n\n- I.\tThe Feast of Ahasuerus (Ch. 1, 2)\n- II.\tThe Feast of Esther (Ch. 3-7)\n- III.\tThe Feast of Purim (Ch. 8-10)\n\n## Where is God?\n\nThe book of Esther has a peculiarity that distinguishes it from any other book in the Bible:  the name of God is not once mentioned; neither are there any references to Jewish law or religion.\n\nEven though God’s name is not mentioned, yet all through the book we see the reality of Divine providence and God’s protection of His people Israel working through human channels and by natural means rather than the supernatural means He has used to save His people from Pharaoh’s power.\n\nThough God and His name was hidden from them at this time, the fact He was still on the scene is preserved in the Scripture.\n\n> Deut. 31:18—And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.\n\nGod hid Himself but did not completely forsake His people. Though He was hidden from them, He was still working for them.\nThere are several acrostics in the Hebrew text of Esther that spell the names of God. The most interesting of these acrostics is found in Esther 7:5 “…Who is he, and where is he,…” Is an acrostic for the Hebrew name of God EHYH that is used in Ex. 3:14 “I AM THAT I AM” (EHYH).  \n[Example of an acrostic using the word “J-O-Y”: Jesus Others You.]\n\n**Practical Application**: \nSee the hand of God in our circumstances in life. God is the sovereign Ruler of the universe and we can be assured that His plans will not be moved by the actions of mere evil men. His providential care for his people, both individuals and the nation, is evident throughout. For instance, we cannot fail to see the  Almighty exerting influence over King Xerxes’s timely insomnia. Through the example of Mordecai and Esther, the silent love language our Father often uses to communicate directly to our spirit.",

      "value": "# The Feast of Purim\t\t\t\tCh. 8-10\n\nThe festival instituted to commemorate the preservation of the Jews in Persia from the massacre with which they were threatened through the imaginations of Haman, Esther 9.  It was probably called Purim (meaning \"lots\") by the Jews in irony.  Their great enemy Haman appears to have been very superstitious, and apparently cast lots to ascertain a favorable day for carrying out his plans against the Jews, Ester 3:7.  The festival lasted two days, and was regularly observed on the 14th and 15th of Adar (March).\n\nAccording to modern custom, as soon as the stars begin to appear on the 13th of the month, as is ordinarily reckoned, but when by Jewish Customary reckoning the 14th of the month has commenced, candles are lighted up in token of rejoicing, and the people assemble in the synagogue.  After a short prayer and thanksgiving, the reading of the book of Esther commences.  The book is written in a peculiar manner, on a roll called The Roll (Megillah).  When the reader comes to the name of Haman, the congregation cries out, “May his name be blotted out,” or “Let the name of the wicked perish.”  When the Megillah is read through, the whole congregation exclaims, “Cursed be Haman; Blessed be Mordecai; Cursed by Zoresh (the wife of Haman); Blessed by Esther; Cursed by all idolaters; Blessed be all Israelites, and blessed be Harbonah who hanged Haman.”\n\nIn the morning service in the synagogue, on the 14th after prayers, the passage is read from the law, Exodus 17:8-16, which relates the destruction of the Amalakites, the people of Agag.  I Samuel 15:8, the supposed ancestors of Haman, Esther 3:1. The Megillah is then read again in the same manner.  When the service in the synagogue is over, all give themselves up to merry-making.\n\n## The kings decree allowing the Jews to protect themselves\t8\n\n- Haman the Agagite, 8:3\n\nHaman was perhaps a descendant of Agag the Amalekite.\n\nThe story of Esther takes place maybe 500 years after the death of king Agag of 1 Samuel 15. Agag was not a proper name but a title ('fiery') of the Amalekite kings like pharaoh was to the Egyptians.\n\n\n- 8:9 is longest verse of the Bible\n- horseback, mules, camels, and young dromedaries\nwhat kind of animals are these research?\n\n## The vengeance of the Jews\t\t\t\t\t9:1-19\n\nEs 9:12 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.\n\nEs 9:13 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.\n\n## The institution of the feast of Purim\t\t\t        \t 9:20-32\n\nA day of turnarounds:\nv.22 sorrow to joy, mourning to a good day\n\n## Mordecai’s greatness\t\t\t\t\t\t10:1-3",

Give Charity to the Needy (don't have enough food for 1 meal)\n4. Have a Mishkah- uninhibited love, joyous feast\n\nThe literal meaning of the Hebrew word mitzvah is commandment, but the generally accepted sense is that of a good deed. The emphasis is on deeds—not on positive thoughts or wishes, but on conscious acts of empathy and kindness.\n\n## Vocabulary\n- Mitsveh means command\n- Purim means \"lots\".\n- Megillat means scroll\n- Mishkah means feast\n\n## Hidden and Mystery\n\nHIDDEN is the key to Purim. (Feb. 25-26 2021) Adults and Children get dressed up (kinda like halloween). \n\n- Esther's name was Hadassah but she's called Esther. The entire miracle was a hidden miracle --- \n\nGod is not named in the book\nEsther does not say she is jewish when she is selected and married to the king\na secret plot to poison the king was discovered by Mordecai\nHaman's secret plot\nEsther's secret request/meaning for her feast\nHighest Holy day \"Yon Kippur\" (means \"LIKE PURIM\")\nYon Kipper - responsibility of actions, new resolutions day of reckoning out of fear\nPurim also a day of reckoning ...but out of love\nKing Ahasuerus\nover l27 provinces\n\nACCORDING TO JEWS: Son in law of grleat king -- wife was teh heir, queen to kingdom, he married into it, HER grandfather had taken the holy things from Jewish temple.\n\nHeld a great feast with malicious intent.

Bigthan = Stephen \n\n## 1. Vashti\n\nI'm so mad at the king! OH... HI there, I'm sorry my name is Vashti and I WAS THE QUEEN. The 127 provinces of the great empire are only gonna here the king's side of the story, but let me tell you mine. \nI was summoned by the king for him to show me off like some trinket to his drunken friends. I did what any self respecting women would do, I refused to go. THAT WAS MY CRIME. I'm not a bad person. But because the men feared an empire wide revolt among wives would happen if I wasn't dealt with. So, I'm now apartment shopping.\n\n## 2. Esther\n\nShalom, I am Hadassah known by Esther to Gentiles. Orphaned after my parents died, I was raised by Mordecai. Alot of people argue if he's my uncle or my cousin, but to me he's the man who raised me. After the king had banished the queen Vashti, I was brought with many other young women to Shushan the Palace. Mordecai and I Agreed I should keep the fact I was a Jew a secret. This ended up being a really important decision in the days to come. My very life and the lives of all my people would be threatened and God would save us by His providence.\n\n## 3. Mordecai\n\nShabbat Shalom. My name is Mordecai. I raised my first cousin, Esther since she was a wee little girl. The older she got the harder it was to keep her safe. 1 day the kings very solders came to my front door demanding the precious child. I released Esther but instructed her to keep her heritage a secret. God be praised!! Though she was taken from me I had a job in the palace that allowed me to keep an eye on her. One day, I even overheard a plot to kill the king and Esther was in a perfect place for me to get the news safely to the king. Haman, the king's second, hated my guts! At first I had nothing personal against him, but was just obeying the law of my God and not bowing down to any man. But eventually this nuisance turned himself into an enemy threatening my entire race.\n\n## 4. Zeresh (Haman)\n\nHi. I'm newly widowed Zeresh. I wish my husband had been a smarter man and he'd still be alive today, that is to say, if he had just listened to me. \n\n- It was MY idea to tell the king how valuable my husband was to him. \n- It was MY idea to put that Jew Mordecai in his place. \n- It was MY idea to build a beautiful and HUUGE gallows to hang on. \n\nIt's not my fault things turned out the way they did, my ideas are GREAT! Now, excuse me while I go mourn my 10 tens and disappointment of a husband.\n\n## 5. Conspirator (Bigthan)\n\nThe king is weak and has no backbone! Hi i'm Bigthan and my buddy in chains in the corner of there is Teresh. We are patriots of the The Persian empire that is being overrun by filthy Jews. Somebody needed to do something about this takeover by an inferior race. Jews are working in the palace like that old Mordecai. The king himself marries that Jewess Esther, but that golden crown doesn't make her a queen in my book. We were this close to getting rid of that spineless king, but that MORDECAI! Now, we are done for!\n\n## 6. King\n\nHi, I'm king Ahaseurus. People think being king is easy and you get to do what ever you want, but it seems I spend more time doing what others want. The one time I feel I acted independently I selected the radiant Esther as my Queen, But in hindsight even that decision wasn't just my own. The providence of God was working a plan to save his people, the Jews. I was manipulated by Haman in giving him the seal to destroy the Jews and soon learned to regret it. I even regret to this day, banishing Queen Vashti and at the time I felt cornered by my counselors. Not to my face of course, cause I'm the king, but some might say I'm easily influenced and a bit of a pushover., but God was able in his infinite wisdom to redeem my regretful and often nearsighted choices.\n",

Had not the king been filled with wine, he would doubtless have looked upon her refusal in a different way, as it would seem by the first verse of the second chapter. He was sorry for her, but according to the law of the Medes and Persians, his word could not be changed, and she could not be recalled by law.  \n\n- The King's Name? Ahasuerus or Xerxes\n\n- the feast 180 days\n\n> Es 1:3 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him: 4 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.\n\n- Question compares names in 10 & 14, two diff lists\n\n> 10 Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas\n 14 Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan\n\n### Chapter 1 Outine\n\n- Ahaseurus, king over 127 provicinces, in his 3rd year made a feast (180 days) at Shushan to show the riches and glory of his kingdom\n- At then end of 180 days, the king made a feast unto all the people present in Shushan\n- During this feast, Vashti held a feast at her palace for the women\n- After 7 days he called for Vashti, but she refused and was banished\n\n> Esther 1:22 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.\n\n## Esther’s coronation\t\t\tch. 2:1-20\n\n- v. 1 After the king's wrath was appeased, he \"remembered\" Vashti.\n\n\n\nMordecai had instructed Esther to conceal her nationality, 2:10.  In this injunction of Mordecai to Esther, we see an indication of Divine leading, for the Jews were generally dispised, and this would have hindered her advancement to the rank as queen.\n\n## Mordecai saves the king’s life\tch. 2:21-23\n",
