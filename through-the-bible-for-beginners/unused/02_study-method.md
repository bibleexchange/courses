# A Bible Study Method

If I am going to do more than nibble at the truth, then I am going to need a **Bible study method**. Search, study, learn, read, seek, receive the Word of God.

2 Timothy 2:15 :STUDY; Deuteronomy 17:19 :READ; Isaiah 34:16 :SEEK; John 5:39 :SEARCH; Acts 17:11 :RECEIVED, SEARCHED; Romans 15:4 :LEARNING

Studying by topic: like "Church Customs and Practices Inspired by Scripture":

* Nehemiah; 8:5 Standing for the Reading of the Word
* Luke 22:19 Communion
* Altar Call
* Praying Aloud
* Lifting up hands
* Water Baptism
* Instruments, Singing, Music in worship
* No Swearing
* 1 Cor. 6:19,20 No Alcohol, No Drugs
* etc.

Verse By Verse: 1. Observe 2. Investigate 3. Apply

## 1. READ: Observation - What does it SAY?

- Before looking at what others have to say about it, familiarize yourself first with what the text says. Our initial focus should be on "what does the Bible say?"
- Look up unfamiliar words
- For difficult wording find paraphrases
- What is NOT said? What is conspicuously missing?
- Develop a consistent bible reading habit.

## 2. RESEARCH: Investigation - What does it MEAN?

- What did it mean to the writer/God?
- First interpretation should be what is most direct, simple, literal
- Before looking at what others have to say about it, familiarize yourself first with what the Scripture as a whole says about itself. Find other places a word is used or a particular subject is mentioned. The Bible generally speaking has a "built in" dictionary"
- Introductory questions to ask when beginning a book:
- What is the name of the book?
- Who wrote the book? Biographical details of writer "Authorial intent"
- When was it written? Historical setting? 
- Who is the original intended audience?
- What are some key words and phrases
- What kind/category of writing is this book? History, Prophecy, Doctrinal, etc.
- What is the length of the book so I can PLAN my study.
- How to find answers to questions?
- With Book Text (objective)
- With Other Book Texts (objective)
- Other Historical Records (objective)
- Commentary Insights (subjective)
- Using tools help you find other places a word is used in the Bible but perhaps translated differently.
- What about other translations of the Bible?
- As God chose each Biblical writer knowing their story and personality, understanding each writer is a key to understanding their writings.
- Answering the question of Meaning requires "INTERPRETATION". (Nehemiah 9:1-7) Adding 1+1+1 to get 3.
- What are some Bible study tools?
- Making "unordered" lists (no particular order) while studying is helpful. You can organize and order later on in your process.

## 3. REALIZE: Application - What can I DO with it?

- How does it relate to me? subjective (inductive vs.deductive) 
- All Scripture is true, but some is merely DESCRIPTIVE without being PRESCRIPTIVE.
- Assessment is an important part of realization. Memory and Memorial.
