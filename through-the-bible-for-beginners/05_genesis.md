## Special Features: 

### Genesis is the foundation for all following Scriptures

The book of Genesis provides an essential foundation for the remainder of the Pentateuch and all subsequent Biblical revelation. Although accounts of &quot;Creation&quot;&#44; &quot;The Flood&quot;&#44;and the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; can be found throughout the ancient civilizations&#44; itis the only trustworthy and mature record concerning the beginnings of theuniverse&#44; humankind&#44; marriage&#44; sin&#44; cities&#44; languages&#44; nations&#44; Israel&#44; and thepurpose of God in all of these things.

### The Title of This Book 

The title of this book given to it in the Greek Septuagint means &quot;creation&quot; or &quot;generation&quot;and the Jews refer to Genesis as &quot;Bereshith&quot; meaning &quot;in the beginning.&quot;

### Genesis is a Book Origins

It was the first book of the Bible written (with the possible exception of Job).

The history of Genesis reveals that the material universe is distinctly God&apos;s work and not some independent process. (Fifty times in chapters one and two are found verbs expressing what God did--God made&#44; saw&#44; said&#44; formed) 

Genesis is the book of firsts: recording the first marriage&#44; first family&#44; first birth&#44;first sin&#44; first murder&#44; first polygamist&#44; first musical instruments&#44; and the first promise of redemption. The covenant made to Abraham in 12:1-3 is central to all Scripture.

Genesis alone explains the origin of the twelve tribes of Israel. Genesis reveals how the descendants of Abraham ended up in Egypt for 430 years and so sets the stage for the Exodus&#44; the central redemption event of the Old Testament. 

## Prophecy

Genesis reveals the prophetic history of redemption and a Redeemer as coming through the seed of the woman (3:15)&#44; the line of Seth (4:25&#44;26)&#44; the line of Shem(9:26&#44;27)&#44; and through the seed of Abraham (12:3.) The New Testament applies Genesis12:3 directly to God&apos;s provision of redemption in Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:16&#44;29.)
