[{"type":"md","value":"# Book of Esther Introduction\n\n## Author\n\nThe Book of Esther does not specifically name its writer. The most popular tradition is that Mordecai (a major character in the Book of Esther) wrote the account.\n\n## Date\n\nThe Book of Esther was likely written between 460 and 350 B.C.\nTraditional view:  Between the 6th and 7th chapters of Ezra before Ezra left for Jerusalem.\n\n[!--timeline--!]\n\nSecondary View: Esther precedes the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.\n\n## Name\n\n- Esther – (a star) The Persian name of Hadassah.\n- Hadassah – (Myrtle) The Jewish name of Esther.  Esther 2:7\n- Myrtle – A plant mentioned in Nehemiah 8:15; Isa. 41:19; Zech. 1:8,10\n\nThe modern Jews still adorn with myrtle the booths and sheds at the Feast of Tabernacles.  Formerly, as we learn from Nehemiah 8:15, myrtle grew on the hills about Jerusalem.  \n\nThe Myrtus Communis is the king denoted by the Hebrew word.  It is a shrub or low tree, sometimes ten feet high, with green shining leaves and snow white flowers, bordered with purple, “which emits a perfume more exquisite than that of the rose.”  The seeds of the myrtle dried before they are ripe, form our allspice.  The plant is common in Palestine today.\n\n## Style\n\nA historical account. There are two principle theories concerning the historical nature of this book:  one, that it is a reliable history; the other, that it is a historical romance founded on fact, or substantially true, like Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar and Henry VIII.  The fact that the action of the book diminishes in the establishment of the popular national feast of Purim,  and that it is a standing memorial of that feast, argues for its general historicity.\nIt is much like the story of Joseph in Genesis 41:34-37, both stories involve foreign monarchs who control the destiny of the Jews. Both accounts show the heroism of Israelite individuals who provide the means for the salvation of their people and nation. The hand of God is evident, in that what appears to be a bad situation is indeed very much under the control of the Almighty God who ultimately has the good of the people at heart. \n\n## Key Verses\n\n>Esther 2:15—Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.\n\n> Esther 4:14—For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? {enlargement: Heb. respiration}\n\n> Esther 6:12—And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.\n\n> Esther 7:3—Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:\n\n## Theme\n\nThis book records God’s deliverance of His people from a threatened destruction.\n\nThe main characters in this epic narrative are Esther, Mordecai, King Ahasuerus and Haman.\n\nThe purpose of the Book of Esther is to display the providence of God, especially in regard to His chosen people, Israel. \nThe Book of Esther records the institution of the Feast of Purim and the obligation of its perpetual observation. The Book of Esther is read at the Feast of Purim to commemorate the great deliverance of the Jewish nation brought about by God through Esther. Jews today still read Esther during Purim.\n\n## Outline\n\nFeasting is a major theme of this book, there are ten recorded banquets, and many of the events were planned, plotted, or exposed at these banquets. The book of Esther could be divided in three parts:\n\n- I.\tThe Feast of Ahasuerus (Ch. 1, 2)\n- II.\tThe Feast of Esther (Ch. 3-7)\n- III.\tThe Feast of Purim (Ch. 8-10)\n\n## Where is God?\n\nThe book of Esther has a peculiarity that distinguishes it from any other book in the Bible:  the name of God is not once mentioned; neither are there any references to Jewish law or religion.\n\nEven though God’s name is not mentioned, yet all through the book we see the reality of Divine providence and God’s protection of His people Israel working through human channels and by natural means rather than the supernatural means He has used to save His people from Pharaoh’s power.\n\nThough God and His name was hidden from them at this time, the fact He was still on the scene is preserved in the Scripture.\n\n> Deut. 31:18—And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.\n\nGod hid Himself but did not completely forsake His people. Though He was hidden from them, He was still working for them.\nThere are several acrostics in the Hebrew text of Esther that spell the names of God. The most interesting of these acrostics is found in Esther 7:5 “…Who is he, and where is he,…” Is an acrostic for the Hebrew name of God EHYH that is used in Ex. 3:14 “I AM THAT I AM” (EHYH).  \n[Example of an acrostic using the word “J-O-Y”: Jesus Others You.]\n\n**Practical Application**: \nSee the hand of God in our circumstances in life. God is the sovereign Ruler of the universe and we can be assured that His plans will not be moved by the actions of mere evil men. His providential care for his people, both individuals and the nation, is evident throughout. For instance, we cannot fail to see the  Almighty exerting influence over King Xerxes’s timely insomnia. Through the example of Mordecai and Esther, the silent love language our Father often uses to communicate directly to our spirit.","lesson":1},{"type":"md","value":"## Reversals\n\n- Kings Feast at Beginning and Mordecai's Feast at End\n- Mordecai and Esther save the king and at they end they save the Jews\n- Hamans Edidct, Elevation and Banquent | Mordecai's Edict, Elevation, and Banquet\n- Esther and MOrdecai's PLanning scenes\n- Haman's Humiliation and Mordecai's Exaltation","lesson":1},{"type":"md","value":"## Laws of God Broken\n\n- Drinking with Gentiles\n- Drinking and Eating impure foods and drink\n- Marrying a Gentile","lesson":1},{"type":"quiz","title":"Esther Introduction Questions","questions":[{"q":"Where is the longest verse in the Bible?","ref":"Esther 8:9","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"Esther 1:11","points":"0"},{"text":"Esther 6:5","points":0},{"text":"Esther 8:9","points":"500"},{"text":"Esther 4:7","points":"0"}]},{"q":"Who is traditionally recognized as the author of the book of Esther?","ref":"","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"Esther","points":"0"},{"text":"Haman","points":0},{"text":"Mordecai","points":"500"},{"text":"Nehemiah","points":"0"}]},{"q":"Was Esther an orphan?","ref":"Esther 2:7","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"","points":"0"},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"No. Her parents just lived elswhere","points":0},{"text":"Yes. her parents were dead","points":500}]},{"q":"Describe Mordecai's and Esther's relationship?","ref":"Esther 2:7","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"Esther is the daughter of Mordecai's uncle.","points":"500"},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":500}]},{"q":"","ref":"","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"","points":"0"},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":500}]},{"q":"","ref":"","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"","points":"0"},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":500}]},{"q":"","ref":"","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"","points":"0"},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":500}]},{"q":"","ref":"","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"","points":"0"},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":500}]},{"q":"","ref":"","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"","points":"0"},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":500}]},{"q":"","ref":"","type":"ALL_ANSWER","answers":[{"text":"","points":"0"},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":0},{"text":"","points":500}]}],"lesson":1},{"type":"md","value":"# The Feast of Purim\t\t\t\tCh. 8-10\n\nThe festival instituted to commemorate the preservation of the Jews in Persia from the massacre with which they were threatened through the imaginations of Haman, Esther 9.  It was probably called Purim (meaning \"lots\") by the Jews in irony.  Their great enemy Haman appears to have been very superstitious, and apparently cast lots to ascertain a favorable day for carrying out his plans against the Jews, Ester 3:7.  The festival lasted two days, and was regularly observed on the 14th and 15th of Adar (March).\n\nAccording to modern custom, as soon as the stars begin to appear on the 13th of the month, as is ordinarily reckoned, but when by Jewish Customary reckoning the 14th of the month has commenced, candles are lighted up in token of rejoicing, and the people assemble in the synagogue.  After a short prayer and thanksgiving, the reading of the book of Esther commences.  The book is written in a peculiar manner, on a roll called The Roll (Megillah).  When the reader comes to the name of Haman, the congregation cries out, “May his name be blotted out,” or “Let the name of the wicked perish.”  When the Megillah is read through, the whole congregation exclaims, “Cursed be Haman; Blessed be Mordecai; Cursed by Zoresh (the wife of Haman); Blessed by Esther; Cursed by all idolaters; Blessed be all Israelites, and blessed be Harbonah who hanged Haman.”\n\nIn the morning service in the synagogue, on the 14th after prayers, the passage is read from the law, Exodus 17:8-16, which relates the destruction of the Amalakites, the people of Agag.  I Samuel 15:8, the supposed ancestors of Haman, Esther 3:1. The Megillah is then read again in the same manner.  When the service in the synagogue is over, all give themselves up to merry-making.\n\n## The kings decree allowing the Jews to protect themselves\t8\n## The vengeance of the Jews\t\t\t\t\t9:1-19\n## The institution of the feast of Purim\t\t\t        \t 9:20-32\n## Mordecai’s greatness\t\t\t\t\t\t10:1-3","lesson":4},{"type":"md","value":"# Purim Now\n\n## 4 Mitsvehs of Purim\n\n1.
