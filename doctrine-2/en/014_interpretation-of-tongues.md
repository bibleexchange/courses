# Interpretation of Tongues

It is a dependent gift and of no value unless there is a message in tongues.

## The Definition of the Gift

Interpretation of Tongues is the ability to make intelligible to the listener the foreign language spoken through the operation of the gift of tongues.

It is an inspired and spontaneous utterance of the spirit in the ordinary language of the people assembled.

Interpretation is no more a product of the human mind than speaking with tongues. It is the product of the Holy Ghost through the vocal organs of the speaker.

## Characteristics of the Gift

The natural gifts and training will influence the statement; but it will be none the less supernatural.

Those who speak in tongues are instructed to pray for the interpretation (I Cor. 14:13)

Let one interpret (I Cor. 14:27)

Much prayer, wisdom, and faith is necessary and will be needed, this will avoid confusion amongst God's children.

## The Purpose of the Gift

### To make understandable the message that is given in the unknown tongue

1. It is the Gift of Interpretation and not translation through explanation of the unknown tongue.
2. It can easily be longer because it is an interpretation and not a translation.

### The English verb "interpret" is found in three forms in the Greek New Testament

1. "Hermeneuo" means "to explain" and usually applies to translation from one language to another (John 1:38 Heb. 7:2)
2. "Methermeneuo" is always used with the thought of exact translation in mind, as may be observed in Matt. 1:23 Mark 5:41
3. "Diermeneuo" which means "to explain thoroughly" clearly indicating the desire to go beyond translation, so as to show not only the sense of a statement, but also its significance as related to the hearer (I Cor. 12:30 I Cor. 14:5).

The Greek word "diermeneuo" translated "interpret" in I Cor. 12
I Cor. 14:5 is used in Luke 24:27, here the Lord Jesus met the
discouraged disciples returning homeward on the road to Emmaus. "He
expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning
Himself."

If we admit that in relation to Christ it means exposition as well as clarification, it must be so in Paul's teachings.

## Examples of the Gift

During Belshazzar's feast the finger of God appeared on the wall.

He had no difficulty in translating the writing for it was the Samaritan script of the pure Hebrew , which he had learned in his childhood before Judah had been carried away.

The writing: "Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin." An exact translation of these syllables is: "Numeration, numeration, weighing division."

Had Daniel simply translated the writing this is all he would have said, but by the spirit he not only knew the meaning of the words but was able to explain.
