# Working of Miracles

> _To another the working of miracles;_ - I Cor. 12:10

Matt. 8:7 The raising of Lazarus â€” Jn. 11 Lazarus was dead. This is as sick as a person can get. Jesus raised him up after he had been four days in the tomb. There is nothing too hard for God.

The working of miracles is the third gift of power.

## The Nature of the Gift of Working of Miracles

It is the supernatural intervention into the ordinary course of nature

God is not bound by man's laws.

### The difference between healing and miracles

All healings performed by the power of God are miracles to a certain degree, though all miracles are not healing.

The man upon whom God has graciously bestowed the gifts of healing does not necessarily have the gift of working of miracles. Also, the one that has the power to perform miracles may have little success in healing the sick.
