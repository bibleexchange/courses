# Word of Wisdom

## INTRODUCTION

Since in God are hidden all treasures of wisdom and knowledge (Col. 2:3), there is nothing that He does not know. We are constantly in the process of learning, but God is omniscient—truly knows it all! God Himself is the abundant storehouse of all knowledge and wisdom.

There are four types of wisdom:

1.  The Wisdom of God (I Cor 2:7; 3:10; Rom 11:33; Jm 1:5; 3:17)
2.  The Gift of the Word of Wisdom (I Cor. 12:8; 2:13; Eph. 1:17; Col 1:9,28)
3.  The wisdom of the world (I Cor. 1:20; 2:6; 3:19; James 3:15)
4.  The wisdom of man (I Cor. 2:4,5,13; Ecclesiastes 1:16-18)

> 1 Cor. 12:8 "For to one is given by the Spirit the Word of Wisdom"

All of God's knowledge is applied in wisdom. This fact brings us immediately to the understanding of what is meant by the term "word of wisdom." Notice, it is not said, "To one is given the gift of wisdom," but it is said, "To one is given "the Word of Wisdom". It follows naturally then that the one possessing the gift of the _word of wisdom_ is granted a word. Meaning, a sentence or a statement from the infinite storehouse of God's Wisdom. The Believer does not receive all wisdom, but only the necessary "Word" for the occasion. God gives the Believer a word of wisdom to solve the situation at hand.

## What the Word of Wisdom Is Not

1. A high degree of intellectual power
2. A deep spiritual insight or understanding of Scripture. It is not enough to know that the Bible is God's revealed Word.
3. Administrative wisdom
4. Confused with Divine wisdom (James 1:5)
5. "Wiseness" or discretion.

## What the Word of Wisdom Is

DEFINITION: The Word of Wisdom may be defined as the Holy Ghost inspiring a Believer to speak the right words at the right time to bring forth the right results.

Some synonyms of "wisdom" are: discernment, discretion, enlightenment, foresight, , knowledge, learning, profundity, prudence, reasonableness, sagacity, sense and skill.

### It is Knowledge Applied

God gives knowledge, but it takes wisdom to apply that knowledge. Having the mind of the Spirit with the skill to apply the word properly to a specific need. Knowledge is insight (of facts)Wisdom is skill (in using those facts) Not just supernatural facts, it's an expression, a word spoken, an utterance.

### It is Entirely Supernatural

We often hear people say, "Yea the Lord hath said" and the Lord didn't say it at all! Just because the expression is used, doesn't mean it is of God. How than can we tell the difference between a _fraud_ and a _real_ utterance from God?

#### It is an operation of the Holy Spirit

It has nothing to do with the flesh or carnal ability.

### It is more than just expressing what is in the Bible

Even the devil knows and uses Scripture, but the devil uses the Scripture _unscripturally_. In Job 2:4…_And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life_. A lawyer used this text in a court setting trying to win his case. Well, is that Scripture? Yes, it's in the scripture, but is it _scriptural_? Who said it? The message is not inspired of God, but the record is inspired. It is exactly what Satan said. We have to understand that a lot that is in this Bible is an inspired record, but not inspired thought. The Bible records exactly as it was said, which is not necessarily what God ordains. David did some things that were not inspired of God. Now the record was inspired, and not what he did. The record is as exactly as it happened.

### It is taking action guided by the Holy Spirit and not any carnal means

The Gift of the Word of Wisdom imparts Supernatural power and ability

Skill or ability to speak right then as an oracle of God (1 Peter 4:11).

### It is an Unfolding

A Supernatural unfolding by the Spirit of God of God's plan and purpose concerning things, places, people, cities, nations, etc. (II Chronicles 20:16,17) a) To strengthen our faith to **know** and act on the Word as it is revealed b) To act on a need as it is unfolded by the Holy Ghost.

## Receiving a Word of Wisdom from God

This important part of the Spirit's endowment of wisdom is a gift to communicate with the unction from the Holy Ghost.

In God's dealings with men **much is mysterious**, and the ordinary Christian is often in need of a word that will throw light upon each situation.

### The gift of the Word of Wisdom cannot be gained through study or experience

**Word of Wisdom** — can come through various means such as: **dreams, visions, audible voice of the Holy Spirit, Tongues & Interpretation or Prophecy**.

Gen. 12:1; 37:5-10, 27-28; 39:7-20; 41:38-41; 42:6; 45:5-8;Isaiah 38:1,4; II Kings 20:1,5-6; II Chron. 32:24; Job 33:14-17; Jonah 3:4; Mat.22:15-22; Luke 4:1-14; Jn. 7:37-43; Jn.16:13 Acts 5:1-16; 6:10; 9:6; 11:28; 14:7-10; 16:16-18; 21:10-11; 22:17-21; 27:23-24, I Cor. 2:4-16; II Cor. 1:12; 5:7; II Peter 3:15

### It is dependent upon our fellowship with God

Can God speak to you? God speaks to men of God for guidance and leadership. Can you fail God when he speaks? Man can fail God and make a mistake, but God can never make a mistake. The Lord always proves the word that he gives you, if you are faithful to obey. **Obedience** is more than just standing behind a pulpit; you really need to have the gifts in operation.

## The Purpose of the Gift

### A Means of Defense Mark (13:11; Luke 21:12-15; Acts 6:9, 10)

### A Means of Settling Controversy (Acts 15:5-12)

### A means to Declare God's Future Acts (I Thessalonians 4:16)
