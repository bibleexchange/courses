# Diverse Kinds of Tongues

Speaking in tongues is not given, as some commentator's hold, as a means of preaching to people of a foreign tongue. The 120 disciples on the Day of Pentecost were overheard speaking in the native languages of the multitude that assembled when news of the language speaking was noised abroad, but the actual preaching was done by Peter in his own native language. Aramaic preaching was done by Peter in his own native language.

## The Definition of This Gift

The Gift of Tongues is a supernatural ability under a spontaneous inspiration of the sprit to speak in a language never learned by the speaker.

## The Most Prominent of the Gifts

### It is most talked about because of its mysteriousness

### It is most widely distributed

### It is the scriptural evidence of the baptism

1. Acts 2:4 The upper room
2. Acts 8:12,15,17 Samaria — One year after the upper room.
3. Acts 10:46 Caesarea — Eighty years after the upper room.
4. Acts 19:6 Ephesus — Twenty-three years after the upper room.

## The Purpose of Tongues

### That men may speak supernaturally to God. I Cor. 14:2

### That believers may magnify God. Acts 10:46

### That our spirits can pray to God without the aid of understanding. I Cor. 14:14-16 Eph. 5:18 Rom. 8:26

### That the church may be edified when the gift of interpretation is present. I Cor. 14:5,12,13,26

### Tongues are a sign to the unbeliever. I Cor. 14:22

## The Difference Between Tongues As a Sign And As a Gift

Tongues as a sign must be distinguished from tongues as a gift.

Not interpreter. Acts 2,10,19

But the gift is to be used in the assembly only when there is an interpreter present.

## The Control of This Gift

Can tongues be controlled? It was out of control in Corinth. Two things wrong:

1. First, speaking without an interpreter.
2. Second, no place was given to the other gifts (I Cor. 14:27)
