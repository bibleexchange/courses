# Sanctification

## The Nature of Sanctification

### The Definition of Sanctification

_Sanctification means to separate from sin and set apart for God._

The two parts of the definition of sanctification are closely aligned. One cannot truly be separated to God without being separated from sin.

#### Part #1: To sanctify means to SET APART for God

Sanctification is the process of "setting apart" for God. This is the primary meaning of the word. Lev. 27:14,16; Num. 8:17; II Chron. 7:16; Jer. 1:5; Matt. 23:17; John 10:36

"Since holiness is primarily the attribute of God, what is 'sanctified' is removed from 'profane' or 'secular' use and reserved to the Lord."—_Harper's Bible Dictionary_

#### Part #2: To sanctify means to SEPARATE from sin or ceremonial defilement

(II Chr. 29:5,15-18; Lev. 11:44; I Chr. 15:12,14; I Thess. 4:7)

_For God called us not for uncleanness, but for holiness_ \[Grk: _hagiasmos_\]. I Thess. 4:7.

The Greek word "hagiasmos" is translated both "holiness" and "sanctification." Holiness and sanctification are used almost interchangeably throughout the New Testament.

### The Necessity of Sanctification (Holiness)

It is the will of God for the life of the Believer to be sanctified, and therefore is not an option. Holiness is an attribute of God and demanded by God in the life of the Believer. (remember: "holiness" and "sanctification" are often translations of the same Greek word.) Read I Thess. 4:3-4, I Peter 1:16, and Heb. 12:14.

NOTE: God is spoken of as being "sanctified by the revelation of His Character"; meaning not that He is **made** holy, but that He is **shown** to be Holy (Eze. 20:41; 28:22; 36:23). God **never** changes, but we **must** change!

### The Evidence of Sanctification

Sanctification is one of the aspects of salvation and begins INWARD and progresses to OUTWARD change. A truly born-again person is made new in Christ (II Cor. 5:17). That is, he is inwardly purified from sin's influence and outwardly purified from sinful deeds.

#### INWARD—Change in Character & Desire

#### OUTWARD—Change in Action & Appearance

Outward sanctification/holiness does not produce salvation, but our salvation must manifest into holy vessels before God and this world as bright lights! (Titus 2:12)

## The Means of Sanctification

How is a person sanctified or made holy? Sanctification is mainly a Divine and miraculous work that must be pursued and yielded to by each person. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as well as the Believer, are active in sanctification,

### The Father sanctifies the Believer (I Thess. 5:23; John 17:17)

In the Old Dispensation, God set apart the firstborn unto Himself, so God in the New Dispensation sets apart the Believer unto Himself and separates him from sin.

### As Father, God will correct his children

We became partakers of God's righteousness and holiness through the administration of chastisement by the Heavenly Father (Heb. 12:10,11).

4.  ### **The Son sanctifies the Believer.**

### Jesus Christ was made our sanctification (I Cor. 1:30)

Separation from sin and separation unto God was provided for us in Christ. Through faith receiving Christ's life, the Believer obtains the sanctification provided in the person of Christ. The more completely we appropriate Christ, the more completely we are sanctified. Perfect sanctification is provided in Him just as perfect wisdom is (Col. 2:3).

### The Blood Sanctifies the Believer

The sacrifice of Christ puts a difference between the Believer and the world just as the Passover lamb's blood put a difference between Israel and the Egyptians (Ex. 11:7; 12:12,13).

##### The Believer belongs to God by the redemption of Christ's blood.

By the offering of His own blood, Jesus has set the Believer apart for God (Heb. 10:10; 13:12).

**The blood cleanses Believers from all guilt of sin** and, thus, separates them from the mass of men under the curse of the law, and sets them apart for God. (Compare I John 1:7,9) In the Old Testament, the blood sacrifice cleansed Israelites from the guilt of ceremonial offense and set them apart for God. In the New Testament, the blood of Christ cleanses the Believer from the guilt of sin and sets him apart for God.

### The Holy Spirit sanctifies the Believer (II Thess. 2:13; I Peter 1:2)

#### The Anointing

Just as in the O.T. type where tabernacle, altar, and priest are set apart for God by the anointing oil (Lev. 8:10-12) so, in the N.T. antitype—the Believer (who is both tabernacle and priest)—is set apart for God by the anointing of the Holy Spirit.

#### The Fruit of the Spirit

It is the Holy Spirit's working in the heart of a man that causes him to overcome the flesh and sin, and clothes the Believer with Divine graces of character and makes him fit to be God's own. Compare Gal. 5:15-23.

#### **The Spirit of God uses the Word** of God to sanctify the Believer

We are sanctified in the Truth, the Word of God. (John 16:13; 17:17; Ps. 119:99; John 15:3) As Believers bring their lives into daily contact with the Word, the sins and imperfections of their lives and hearts are disclosed and by putting them away are increasingly separated from sin unto God (2 Cor. 3:18; I Cor. 15:31).

### The Believer is active in sanctification

The Believer is not passive in the work of sanctification. That is, God is not going to completely sanctify a person with no effort of their own.

#### Sanctification is something that we must pursue or seek earnestly.

While it is God's work, we have a part: make complete sanctification the object of our earnest desire and pursue it (Hebrews 12:14, Matt. 6:33).

We attain unto sanctification through presenting our members as servants (literally "slaves") to righteousness and becoming bondservants unto God. (Rom. 6:19, 22; 12:1; I Cor. 15:31).

#### We perfect holiness by cleansing ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and Spirit (2 Co 7:1)

To reach the end of perfect holiness: we must come out from among unbelievers, refusing all alliances with them, and touching no unclean thing. We must conduct ourselves as strangers in a strange land (Heb 11:9,10; II Cor. 6:17,18; I Peter 1:22).

It is, of course, under the guidance and power of the Spirit that we do this, but it is us that must separate ourselves from this world and its sinful influences.

## The Time of Sanctification

When does sanctification take place? Sanctification is both _**instantaneous**_ and _**progressive**_.

### Sanctification is Instantaneous

Sanctification begins at salvation, and in relationship to God, the Believer is completely sanctified at salvation (John 15:3).

As far as our standing before God is concerned, the born-again believer is completely sanctified in that he is cleansed from the guilt of sin unto God (Heb. 10:10, 14). As a newborn babe in Christ, the Believer is completely sanctified. (As perfect as a newborn infant is perfect.) (2 Co 5:17)

#### Sanctification is instantaneous as man yields his will and offers himself to God

It is the Believer's present and blessed privilege and immediate and solemn duty to present himself to God as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1,2). When such a presentation of our bodies is made to God in the faith that "our old man is crucified with Christ, that we are dead indeed unto sin and alive unto God," (Rom. 6:6,7), God will respond with fire upon the sacrifice, as He did upon the gifts of His people in the Old Testament. The believer then, so far as his will, heart, and the governing purpose of his life are concerned, is wholly sanctified.

#### Jesus gives the Believer His righteousness (Romans 5:17; 3:22)

Man has no righteousness of his own. The Scripture declares that all our righteousness is as filthy rags. (Isaiah 64:6)

### Sanctification is Progressive (I Thess. 5:23; I Corinthians 3:1)

Paul describes babes in Christ as being carnal. Sanctification begins at the new birth. Those truly in Christ are justified and cleansed from sin through the blood of Jesus. Yet, the Scripture tells us that the babes in Christ are still carnal. The Scripture instructs the Christian to mature in Christ and to put off the carnal nature. Sanctification is both immediate and progressive. The born-again are immediately washed in the blood of Jesus and by grace brought into a right relationship with God. But there is also a progressive or continued work of Sanctification of putting off the old nature and maturing as Christians. Let us look to the Word of God to explain this progressive work of Sanctification.

#### A growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

II Peter 3:18 refers to growing or maturing in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. If it were not possible to grow in grace then the Bible would not encourage us to do so. There is a definite process of growth as the Christian learns more about Jesus and who He is.

#### The Word will produce growth in the Christian (I Peter 2:2)

As has already been stated the Scripture indicates that babes in Christ are still carnal. That is they are justified in Christ through the blood, yet there is a continuing growth process of putting off the old man. It is neither the will nor plan of God for Christians to remain as babes in Christ. Babes need to be taught the Word of God so they can follow the Word and grow in Christ.

#### An abounding more and more in a Godly walk and in pleasing God (I Thessalonians 4:1)

#### An increase in love (I Thessalonians 3:12)

#### A transforming into the image of our Lord Jesus, from glory to glory, each new gaze at Him making us more like Him (II Cor. 3:18)

#### A growing up into Christ in all things, until we attain unto a full-grown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:11-15)

## The Results of Sanctification

### Christ has perfected forever those who are sanctified (Hebrews 10:14)

1. By the one offering of sacrificing Himself for our sins.
2. Their standing before God as guiltless is already forever secured for the sanctified.
3. The sanctification spoken of here is the separation from the guilt of sin and secured unto God by the shed blood of Jesus.

### Those whom Jesus sanctifies are one with Him and He is not ashamed to call them brethren (Hebrews 2:11)

### We are saved through sanctification (II Thessalonians 2:13)

1. Sanctification results in salvation.
2. The sanctification spoken of here is the sanctification that the Holy Spirit works.
3. The salvation spoken of here is not salvation in the mere sense of the forgiveness of sins, but salvation in the fullest sense of deliverance from sin's dominion and presence.

### Sanctification results in seeing the Lord (Heb. 12:14)

1. Holiness also refers to sanctification. The Greek word for holiness is also rendered sanctification.
2. Without sanctification no man shall see the Lord.

### Sanctification secures us an inheritance (Acts 20:32)

#### The believer receives the initial part of the inheritance at salvation

The children of God are heirs of God. An heir is one who receives the inheritance. God does not give the fullness of His inheritance to a child. Galatians 4:1-2 tells us that the child heir is under tutors until the time appointed of the Father. That is until the child becomes of age to take the responsibility of being an heir (Romans 8:17).

#### The Holy Spirit filled Believer receives the earnest of their inheritance

The word earnest means "_a down payment_" with more payment to follow. God will bestow a greater measure of Holy Ghost power as the individual matures and is able to walk in that power. God has so much in store for the Holy Spirit filled believer. The Holy Spirit filled believer experiences more of the inheritance and power of God as they mature in Christ and yield to God. Why is it that some men walk in more of the power of the Holy Ghost than others? It is not the Holy Spirit that lacks, but it is the individual that lacks faith and needs to mature spiritually (Ephesians 1:13-14).

#### The more sanctified a Believer becomes, the more power of God he can receive

As the Spirit filled Believer experiences the progression of sanctification he is able to receive more of God's power and to walk in more of his inheritance. God does not give us more than we can receive. The Believer can only receive more of God as they separate themselves from the world and crucify the old nature.
