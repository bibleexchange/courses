# Word of Knowledge

God is the source of all knowledge. God does not learn anything, God knows all things, and nothing is a surprise to Him. The ultimate source of all true knowledge is the omniscience (omniscience: all knowing) of God (I Corinthians 12:8; Isaiah 40:28; I Samuel 2:3; Rom. 11:33).

The Word of Knowledge is by Revelation from the Holy Ghost. A Word spoken to your Spirit by the Holy Ghost.

## What The Word of Knowledge Is Not

### It is not natural ability

Men might have a high degree of natural ability, very talented which is good but that is not what the Word of Knowledge is (Daniel 2:22; I Cor. 2:9-10).

The deep things are those things that are beyond man's ability to know on his own.

1. Talent and ability are not what the Word of Knowledge is.
2. It is not the ability to evaluate a situation and receive knowledge through observation.
3. It is not an educated guess to try to discern a problem.

A person may have great ability to observe situations and the lives of people and gain knowledge through observation. You can learn much by just watching people and their actions. This can be a valuable skill, but it is not the Word of Knowledge.

### It is not natural learning

Yes we are to (II Timothy 2:15… _Study to shew yourself approved unto God…), not just a workman, but approved,_ But a person can study and be very diligent but we don't need anything new for the sake of being new, we need to know truth. And we should apply ourselves in every aspect of learning. Listening: somebody said the only time you learn is when your mouth is shut I don't want to leave the impression that the Holy Spirit is going to make up for your lack. These supernatural gifts are for a purpose/reason — for the up building of the church.

At the same time we need to apply ourselves diligently, to studying and to learning.

1. Knowledge gained by study is good, but this is not the Word of Knowledge.
2. The understanding of much knowledge through learning is not the Word of Knowledge.
3. Study is an essential aspect of the ministry, but study is not the Word of Knowledge.

We must also understand the value of study and learning. The Word of Knowledge is a special revelation that cannot be known by natural means.

### It is not knowledge that experience gives us

How do you get knowledge by experience? Is all the knowledge that we get by experience, is it all good?God does not use a person apart from his personality and from his intellect.Take a person that is very learned and educated, and if he prophesied that would show by him using words that another person prophesying would never use. So God uses personality and intellect, that doesn't mean it has an effect other than how it is being said, the means is always the same. Experience gives us knowledge.

### It is not a gift to understand or know all knowledge

1. It is not an impartation of wisdom to know how to do something.
2. It is a specific word of information.

Remember this is a "Word" of revealed information or knowledge and not a gift to know it all. Some mistakenly think this gift is about God making people wise or giving them a high intelligence. This gift is a revealed word of God about a specific thing at a specific time.

## What The Word of Knowledge Is

### The Word of Knowledge is a supernatural expression of the Divine will, purpose, and plan of God

The Greek word used for word to describe this gift is _rhema._ It means a revealed word of God.

This is the same word that is used in Rom.10:17 - …_faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God._ In John 1:1 the Greek word _logos_ is used to refer to the Word.

_Rhema_ is a revealed word, which is a word given by God. _Logos_ is the expressed or spoken word.

#### Knowledge is the intellectual apprehension of information

It is information acquired or understood. In relation to this gift it refers to information given or revealed by God and not acquired through natural means.

God reveals knowledge of His will to man that can only be received by Divine means.

### It is an operation of the Holy Spirit

Totally, completely, has nothing to do personal knowledge.

You've heard this before, and you hear someone say, yea the lord hath said, and the Lord didn't say it at all. Just because that expression is said, doesn't mean it is of God.

How than can we tell what the difference is between a so called expression and a real utterance from God?

Sometimes people express verbally what was in the word, The devil knows the scripture; he even used it against Jesus, and there are expressions in the Bible concerning what the devil said that is contrary to scripture.

In Job 2:4…And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.

### The Word of Knowledge is a supernatural inspired utterance of facts.

#### Knowledge is insight of facts

Wisdom is skill in using those facts which will be discussed under Word of Wisdom.

#### God reveals information that can then be spoken to an individual or to a congregation

#### God could reveal that someone has a particular sickness

This knowledge is then spoken to that person or to the congregation. God reveals sickness so he can heal and make well. The individual with the sickness knows that this knowledge did not come by man. This gift encourages faith to believe for the healing.

### The Word of Knowledge is an operation of the Holy Spirit

1. Man has nothing to do with the impartation of the Word of Knowledge.
2. The Holy Spirit controls and operates this gift.
3. God reveals when He wants to and Decides to whom He will reveal to.

### The Word of Knowledge is a miraculous revelation of facts that could not be known by natural understanding.

1. God has knowledge of everything (Colossians 2:3)
2. This gift reveals information that could not otherwise be known.

### It is dependent upon our fellowship with God

## The Purpose of the Gift

### To reveal knowledge that will help the preacher to minister to the sick

#### To give the preacher knowledge of what sickness is in the congregation

God will reveal to you the needs of the people so you can help them. God reveals the sickness because it is His intent to heal and deliver.

#### This revelation of what the sickness is will encourage faith to pray for the sick

The individual who is in need is also greatly encouraged to believe for their healing or miracle.

### To reveal knowledge that will protect the people of God

1. God can warn of danger to keep you from harm.
2. God can warn you not to go to a certain place to avoid harm.
3. God can warn of future events to keep you from making harmful choices.

### To reveal the plans of the enemy

> And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber. II Kings 6:12

There was no natural way that Elisha could know the words of the enemies of Israel unless God revealed it to him. God revealed the plans of the enemy to Elisha.

#### God can warn a pastor of the cause of division in his church

God can reveal to a pastor if someone is spreading lies and causing problems in the church. The Word of Knowledge can also reveal to a pastor the sin in the congregation so he can deal with it and help the people in the church.

#### God can warn us of what the devil is trying to do so we are prepared and not taken by surprise

## Biblical examples of the Word of Knowledge

### Where did Moses get his matchless and scientific story of creation?

Was Moses there at creation, when Adam and Eve were created, where did Moses get that information from? Moses got it from the Lord. The things that Moses talked about and wrote about were beyond anything natural. He could not have learned that by any amount of study or by applying himself to natural means. No, it came to Moses supernaturally. Moses wrote the first five books of wisdom and knowledge.

### Noah (Genesis 6:13-22)

### II Kings 5:26 — Elisha had a word of knowledge given to him, to see what evil thing Gehazi had done

### Paul received great revelation knowledge by the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 3:3-5)

Paul as a Jew hated the Gentiles and even hated the Christians. How did he receive this knowledge to accept the Gentiles? — by the revelation of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 1:11-12).

### John on the Isle of Patmos received the revelation of the seven churches and events that would take place in the future

Where did John get this revelation? Was it something he studied or he learned from others? John received this revelation in the Spirit.

_I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day_ — Rev. 1:10

What is the Lord's Day? This is not on a Sunday, but refers to the day of the Lord's coming. John saw supernaturally events on the Lord's Day. We will further discuss this book in Revelation class.

### Jesus as God in the flesh possessed all knowledge

Jesus is our supreme example in all things. Jesus had insight and knowledge that were beyond the realm of natural ability.

#### Jesus saw Nathaniel under the fig tree (Jn. 1:48-49)

#### Jesus knew the thoughts of the religious leaders (Mt. 12:25; Luke 6:8)

#### Jesus knew there would be a donkey waiting for Him to use to enter Jerusalem (Mt. 21:2)

#### Jesus knew Judas would betray Him (Jn. 13:26)

#### Jesus and the Samaritan Woman ( John 4)

Jesus knew by the Spirit that the Samaritans would respond to the gospel. Ordinarily, a Jew would have gone around Samaria to avoid any problems, but Jesus knew He _must needs_ _go through Samaria._

Jesus had a word of wisdom, to know of the Samaritan women's need and unfolded it. Jesus knew what to say and how to say it to this woman that had five husbands, and the one that she was living with was not her husband.

The soul-winner's greatest need is the Word of Wisdom. When you're witnessing to someone you want them to respond to what you're saying so let the Holy Ghost give you the Gift of the Word of Wisdom.

### Paul (Acts 23:6-7)

### Peter with Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5)

The Word of Wisdom is revealed to give one insight into corruption. "why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost" Ac.5:3

Not everyone is going to like you, if you begin to unfold their life and read them like an open book. You're not going to have angelic beings to minister to. People have problems and they need help. They're not going to come in with folded wings. You can walk an elephant before a blind man and he can't see it. Not everyone is going to receive your reproof and council, but you must be faithful to what God has shown you.

> John 8:26 —"I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him"

> John 8:28 —"as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things"

> John 8:38 —"I speak that which I have seen with my Father"

Fasting doesn't purchase you anything with God, but it brings you into a place where faith soars where it is so easy to believe. God is always more faithful to you than you are to Him.

It is going to take faith; we must believe and act upon what God gives to us.

Out of the vast storehouse of knowledge God takes just a word and gives it to man for a specific purpose.

The gift of the word of knowledge can help you to see in a person's life, and help you to help other people.

The word of knowledge can help you to see the genuineness of people, and where they are at.

If you console a person in there sin, than you are not helping them. You must help them out of their sin.

The devil comes as an angel of light, to deceive. Makes things seem as they are, when they are not.

We need to have these gifts operating in our lives, to help us identify what is right and what is wrong, and to help the church. There is much deception in this hour.
