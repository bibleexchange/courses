<details><summary>Gospel Presentation</summary><span>

JAPHETH and HEATHER share a common faith in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. This relationship with Christ is central to their relationship with each other. This is a proven and enduring foundation for the life they are building together.

They would like you to know Jesus as they do. All of us are born with a sin problem, missing our holy purpose. Sin weighs us down, defeats our dreams and separates us from God who is the creator of every good thing.

Romans 6:23--For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
You do not have to go another day at odds with God. Salvation is God’s free gift and Jesus will be your faithful Guide and Anchor. 

If you have any questions at all, please take a Beleiver aside and just say “TELL ME MORE about Jesus.”</span></details>

## 11. Minister Gives Wedding Challenge

<details><summary>Wedding Challenge</summary><span>

<p>JAPHETH and HEATHER, by the help of God, I will challenge you  both briefly from Ecclesiastes 4 & Malachi 2.</p>

> Ecclesiastes 4: &mdash; 9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. 11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? 12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

- "She's Your wife" / "He's Your Husband"

> Malachi 2:14,15 14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. 15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.

- Enough in life will erode and whittle away at your relationship.
- Remember to always be Tender Toward Each Other .. I love you and thank you

THE CREDIT OF DESIGN goes entirely to God. God brings people together. He builds the families, he imparts the love, he ordains the times and seasons.

But the Beautiful Union, you enter into today would never happen until you RECOGNIZED each other.

1. ALWAYS RECOGNIZE its GOD’s DESIGN that brought you together and it will be your continued and MUTUAL commitment to his WILL that will KEEP you together.

2. ALWAYS RECOGNIZE you are peers and equals in the most unequal of ways. JAPHETH you are responsible to lead as the spiritual head of your home. HEATHER you are responsible for the spiritual direction your home will take. Your very testimony of Godly living will sanctify your home.
3. Finally, ALWAYS RECOGNIZE you belong to each other. Each other’s needs, wants, dreams, problems, issues, concerns. You share it all in common.
Odds are there will challenges ahead, but always run toward each other, “Surely, thou art my bone and my flesh.”

- He's My Husband / She's My Wife
